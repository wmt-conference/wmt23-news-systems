DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all handle the input file in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The suffix name of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix name controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file ((.i) to be a c file, and sets the connection to the form c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file and sets the connection to the c++ form.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and subsequent operations:
.c C source program; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
.C C++ source code; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
.cc C++ source code; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
CXX C++ source code; preprocessed, compiled and assembled
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
.i preprocessed c files; compiled, compiled
.ii Preprocessed c++ files; compiled, assembled
.s compiles language source programs; compiles
Compilation of source language programs; preprocessing and compilation
.h preprocessor files; files that are not normally present under another name on the command line are passed to the linker. Typically these include:
.0 Object file
This is an archive file.
Connections are always the last step, unless the -cec-, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error blocks the entire process).
At the connection stage, all.e files, -1 library files, unidentified filenames ((including the specified.o H files and.a library files corresponding to the source program) are passed to the connector options in the order of the command line.
The option must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d-r '.
Most `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
The formats listed here are not the default options.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later chapters.
The code generation option
Overall option
Make clear that the language of the file input is the language (rather than the default choice from the file name suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is available in.language
Turn off any explicit language pronouncements that are consequent to the filename suffix processing the file behind the RE AS E ` -x' option).
If only part of the four steps (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ∀ -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to begin, and the ∀~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that certain combinations of options (e.g., ∀-x cpp-output-E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile a source file, ETER. In the absence of the ERA ATI, GCC uses a ▽.o' by replacing the source file name after the file name in the ∀.ec file name label. Other options can be used to choose a name.
This is what happened to the target file.
After compilation it stops, and no compilation is done.
Because the compiler for those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, the compiler of GNU does not have this problem; the compiler can accept C "dialects" to work between different stages of the compilation process: it supports ANSI-compliant C programs.
This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that do not support ANSI Cc, as well as certain ANSI trigraph features that indicate proper and rarely used ANSI trigraph attributes such as unix and vax, and turns it off despite its usage in all standard libraries in a hosted environment. The main function returns an int value; typical examples are almost all programs except for the kernel. The corresponding free-standing environment does not have a standard library, nor is the program port necessarily main, the most obvious example being the kernel within the operating system.
Function declarations without arguments, e.g. `int foo (); ', treated in C style -- i.e. without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only).
Normally, a function like foo means that the argument is empty in C++.
Section list is removed from here in an attempt to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
The NU c manual details, which we have removed, so that when the content is out of date, people don't read it.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '∀ -traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
He is the same as the result of the '`-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the preprocessor mentioned above, but excluding the other effects of the '`-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the character `$' in identifiers (for C++ only).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the ` $' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of the ant type to the enumeration type (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-templates -fexternal-templates produces small code for the template declaration (limited to c++), by generating one copy for each template function only where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must label in all files that use the template, `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (statement).
When the program compiles with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all external type. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be done through typedef, which quotes each instance that is needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option used when compiling ` -fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are treated as virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not imply that every call to the member function will be through the internal null table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; then it does so.
-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatch of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-is-variable which allows this to be assigned a value (for c++ only).
The incorporation of user-defined free storage management mechanisms into c++ makes the attributable '`this' seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, the assignment of this is invalid inside the class member function.
However, for backward compatibility, you can enable this by selecting the '`-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Defines char as a symbolless type, like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default type of char. They can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symmetry of the data.
But many programs have been written using only simple char, and the endpoint is that with a symbol number ((or no symbol number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its antiderivative option, enables that program to work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as a signed char or an unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If there is no explicitly declared ` signed' or "unsigned' modifier, these options are used to define bitfields with or without symbols.
By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed; however, if the '▽-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data segment without special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs where it's a very bad idea to change string constants, the '`-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The impact of coronavirus pneumonia on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 financial crisis.
The global epidemic of coronavirus pneumonia has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has left health services crippled and on the verge of collapse, and the restrictive measures taken by governments have caused considerable disruption in the global economy.
The impact of this epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs as restrictions on circulation limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Smugglers are unable to cross the border due to travel restrictions, and may have to find new routes and methods.
Modes of drug use and supply may change and the government's ability to respond could be hindered.
The transformation of the new coronavirus is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.
After the economic crisis of 2008, some users began looking for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injectable drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut their budgets related to drugs.
Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current economic recession in the same manner.
Additionally, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be lowered, making it easier for traffickers to act.
In some countries, large numbers of drugs are smuggled through commercial airlines, which are expected to be most affected by the drug trafficking.
The use of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or in private luggage has been reported, sometimes in large quantities. Since restrictions on air passenger transport are imposed almost everywhere, the activity of supplying drugs on commercial air travel may have been completely interrupted.
Though the international postal supply chain has been disrupted, the use of darknet and courier freight transport is likely to increase.
In the long run, the recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.
With rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, to suffer from addiction diseases and to turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether in production or transportation.
The drug traffickers could take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
These shifts may take root quickly and become a new reality for many communities as the government's responsiveness declines.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns partly explain why the market expanded
Drug use has been increasing around the world, both in terms of numbers and in terms of the proportion of users in the world's population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, representing 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64 years, compared with an estimated 269 million in 2018, representing 5.3% of the population.
Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has increased much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects partly differences in overall population growth during this period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster rise in young people in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults are the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
Drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.
This overall increase in drug use is partly attributable to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas: more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, up from 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization tendencies are more prominent.
An increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the world's poorest people, and drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Moreover, drugs like cocaine are also linked to the wealthier parts of the world.
In different countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the upper classes of society.
However, the highest rates of drug addiction occur in those of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug use and disease and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in the wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints created by the global coronavirus pneumonia crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, like rising unemployment, have in the past been associated with an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide out of work.
Coronavirus or the pandemic would lead to the further expansion of the drug market Corona pneumonia might lead to more farmers or cultivation of illegal crops, or because of reduced control of the State competent organs or more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.
Related restrictions for COVID-19 resulted in reduced air and land traffic, maritime trafficking may have increased as a result, with a lower risk of interception on sea and greater numbers of cases of trafficking than air or land.
Recently, there have been reports of cocaine being sent directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the market for potentially harmful opioids is increasing and more complex.
In addition to plants and plant-derived substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.
Approximately 500 new active substances are produced annually in the domestic market of the Member States.
Currently, the majority are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Opioid-like new psychoactive substances made up only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substance categories identified in 2014, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the newer opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl whose effectiveness and harm have been shown to lead to overdose deaths in North America and in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a solvent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and in the manufacture of fake pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence of the use of injecting novelty psychoactive substances in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues from six European cities found that many syringes were laced with a novelty psychoactive substance, mercury, that has a stimulant effect.
2 The use of novel psychoactive substances may become more entrenched in vulnerable groups
However, a single class of new psychoactive substances has hardly ever generated a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among socially marginalized groups, such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate: many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors for drugs such as ketamine, methylamine, and amphetamines have been placed under international control.
Drug dealers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives to not only the more loosely controlled substances, but chemicals specifically designed to circumvent control, the so-called special rubber precursors.
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia are likely to further squeeze out poisoners who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico shows that this is already a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that a shortage of methylamine precursors imported from East Asia spurred a price spike in Mexico and the United States.
The market is always changing
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opioids seized by the authorities of the Russian Federation decreased by around 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use fell significantly.
But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cassettes, including methamphetamine and a-cassettes, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities report that the number of seized secret processing points for various illegal drugs has recently increased dramatically, more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.
Growth of methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutions staff have revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystal methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern, alongside dopamine, natriurethane and quetiapine.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than methamphetamine or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing plants, and the Cannabis Bureau has expressed concern about the large-scale import of synthetic methamphetamine preparations which are used by some of the methamphetamine processing plants as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.
However, in the first half of 2019, the volume of the catch was 657kg, an increase compared to the previous year.
The massive seizures of methylamine in other countries, believed to be from Afghanistan, also show that production in the country is increasing rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Cannabis use is increasing in most jurisdictions that have legalized nonmedical use
The manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use is permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend is observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In the first two states to pass legislation, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use among adults has increased, particularly over the past month, as well as daily or near-daily use, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that the use of cannabis in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling in the past month.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use .
Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded, use also grew between 2018 and 2019.
However, 40% of cannabis users were still obtaining some products from illegal sources in 2019.
Could the legalization of marijuana be the reason behind the global plunge in the harvest of cannabis strains?
In 2018, global harvest of marijuana straw fell to the lowest level in 20 years, due to declining harvest in North America, which fell 84% in the past 10 years.
By comparison, seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market have played a key role in the decline.
The effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country is still difficult to assess.
Several countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has declined following the passage of national legislation.
The harm of legal and illegal drug markets for vulnerable populations medicinal opioids, which are used primarily in high-income countries for pain management and palliative treatment, are distributed unevenly across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opiates available for medical use were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.
It is estimated that 88% of the world's population lives in low- and middle-income countries, yet less than 10% of medicinal opioids are consumed.
Barriers to access to medical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at higher risk of developing drug-related illness. About 35.6 million people suffer from drug-related illness in 2018 [2].
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and its consequences. Studies in high-income countries confirm this, as in these studies individuals' adverse socio-economic trajectories are related to the risk of drug use disorders, not just their situation at a certain time in their lives.
Drug dependence also increases socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, minorities and migrants, diverse groups of sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster and those in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or have difficulty in accessing treatment services.
In the past decade the social impact of harmful drug use on wider society has increased, according to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death.
Global disability-adjusted life expectancy attributed to drug use increased by 17% between 2007 and 2018 [2].
The disability adjusted years of life associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, common among injection drug users, are particularly high at 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited worldwide data suggest that binge drinking may be a significant factor in deaths.
However, alcohol seems to be playing a greater role in violence than drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partly attributed to multiple intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer pressure.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Where there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be carried out in a nonviolent manner.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the quantity of trafficking than on certain shifts that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or incarceration of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.
The latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used drug, and opioids are the most dangerous
An estimated 189 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the associated dangers of opioids are ignored as fewer people take them.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to substance use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost by disability or premature death believed to be due to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, Kumamoto is the acute opioid crisis; in North America, it is Fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but all are working hard to combat a opioid crisis fueled by the easy availability and low-cost production of the drug.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Fentanyl overdoses are caused in part by the unpredictability of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of cumin has been growing significantly.
A growing number of patients with comedo-therapy-associated conditions are being treated in the region.
In 2017, the number of seized Kumano horse worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
But in 2018, the global catch was reduced to 32 tons after India passed a new law to regulate gametes.
These two crises are due to simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation for the Quimado and many of its analogues or precursors.
What exacerbates these crises is that these substances are available on both the drug and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent misuse.
Increased use of stimulants
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasingly used in their main markets.
Some 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine became increasingly popular in North America and Western Europe.
Around 27 million people used ketamine in the same year, with methyl ketamine being the most widely used ketamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two areas has been increasing for the last 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine co-exist and sometimes replace each other, such that the use of one drug decreases as use of the other rises, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demand of the same market.
Coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that around 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and around 10% of HIV infections globally were caused by injecting drug use.
More than one million people are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of these from liver disease caused by hepatitis C. Most hepatitis C in injecting drug users remain untreated.
5 The opioid shortage due to restrictions on necoronary pneumonia may lead users to switch to more easily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
There may be more harmful uses as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.

EU summit debates on refugee policy, EU officials: Reception process is at a standstill
EU summit clashes over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
At the latest EU summit of the day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that EU leaders agreed to introduce tougher policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.
The EU's move reportedly responds to concerns about the growing problem of illegal migration in Europe, where the core issue of the EU is the small number of illegal migrants who ultimately could be repatriated.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds to strengthen the external border by means such as infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and member states argue over issues such as the payment of fences.
Weiderlein has repeatedly stated that the EU funds will not cover the fees.
But diplomats from a number of member states say that if the EU were to share the cost of installing cameras, observation towers and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up construction.
EU officials acknowledged that there are bottlenecks in every step of the reception process, with limited reception capacity and overwhelmed migration authorities in member countries failing to stop refugees from submitting large numbers of asylum applications across the EU, and that the EU's reception system is in near-permanent crisis, according to EurActiv.
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half as many as the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on the principle of reciprocity: EU countries can return illegal migrants on the basis of a judgement issued by a court in another member state.
EU leaders also agreed to increase the use of the concept of the safe state, which would pave the way for the EU to create a common list, the report said.

U.S. upgrade of silicon chips hits the global semiconductor industry hard
Recently, the US war on China's silicon chips has been intensified, with the Netherlands, Japan under pressure from the US to start regulating the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei companies and banning US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei, and the Biden administration is preparing to publish an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese tech industry.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped fighting against China's silicon and nickel development, while cracking down on the supply chain of semiconductor products from China, and building a semiconductor industry chain alliance to rival China's silicon, trying to completely open China in advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to establish a silicon technology alliance with Korea, or to establish a silicon four-way alliance with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan in China, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain link through such mechanisms as the US-Japanese-Indian-Ausralian quadrilateral mechanism and the Printing Sea Economic Framework link, the United States intends to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States by introducing politicisation, campaigning and weaponisation into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of chip production and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the U.S.'s tactical success against China has resulted in a loss of over 1,800 tons.
Recently, PanLin Group, a well-known US chip equipment supplier, announced that as a result of the latest round of export bans on Chinese chip manufacturing equipment, it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plan to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global photometer giant Asmar Holding, a Dutch company, recently warned that a ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
US media analysis, after the US government cracked down on industries such as Chinese chip and semiconductor, many American companies suffered greatly, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of crystal manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The United States, which claims to be suppressing China's advanced semiconductor industry, has dragged water down the global semiconductor industry and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a highly technological and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a close-knit global semiconductor industry chain.
According to experts, the entire production process of semiconductor products based on specialized division of labour requires crossing the boundaries of countries more than 70 times and up to 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially for advanced manufacturing processes, and heavily dependent on East Asia.
Even if the U.S. steers its advanced chip supply chain toward U.S.-led small-circulation regionalisation, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry is very difficult to change.
The United States is going to reshape the semiconductor industry chain from China to the Americas, and reshape the global semiconductor industry.
The chip industry is the heart of the global future and all countries around the globe will participate in the development of the chip industry.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the introduction of the Innovation and Competition Act, 2022 (US Competition Act) and the Science Act of 2022, to use technological hegemony, to consolidate its technological leadership, to encourage its allies and to pressure chip manufacturers like Intel, TSMC and Samsung to establish plants in the United States, and to ensure the U.S.'s global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created problems for China's chip industry and related industry development, and reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical crackdown by US companies on the Chinese chip industry and its breakthroughs will cost them the huge Chinese market, ultimately weakening the innovation will and ability of US technology companies and damaging the development of the global chip industry.

According to the State Council Office of the State Council's Advisory on Promotion of Individual Pensions, the individual pension funds accounts fund could be invested in financial products including banking, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and crowdfunding funds.
The first individual pension assets were sold to mark the formal acquisition of personal pension assets by individual pension investors through the personal pension fund account.
In November last year, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission put in place an interim regulation for the personal pension business of commercial banks and financial institutions in the Philippines.
The scheme allows the participant to purchase personal pension products, such as personal pension savings, personal pension property management products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products, through an individual pension fund account.
The three departments of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued notices declaring the implementation of an individual pension in 36 cities and districts, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an, and Shanxi.
As of the end of 2022, the number of participants in individual pensions is 19.54 million, while the number of contributors is 61.13 million, with a total amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot only offered three categories of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance and personal pension crowdfunding funds.
Now that personal pension funds are pooled, how should investors choose to fund their retirement?
The experts in the R&D department said that in comparison to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of pension products and the personal pension products have three features.
The three main components are: robustness, more robust risk management, sound investment strategies and policies, and the implementation of independent custody by non-parent banks.
The second is long-term, the term of the pilot phase of the pension fund is 5 years or more. The next step issued personal pension fund, the minimum holding period is 1 year, and it is encouraged to hold more than 3 years.
Three is inclusive, the threshold for buying products is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, and the fees for hosting and administration of the product are more preferential.
Professionals point out that investors make their decision based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Individual pension savings with long term, high interest rate and high security features, are suitable for people with low risk tolerance; the individual pension insurance products are high in security and are suitable for people who can not bear the risk of investment and can receive stable returns; while the individual pension management products and public funds are not insured or have a guaranteed return, there is a certain investment risk, but the expected return is high, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

The fitness industry needs to get out of a trust crisis - China News Network
Another big gym and thunderstorms?
Recently, there has been a lot of public attention for the rights of members in well-known fitness institutions.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their shops were not operating normally; later, rumors about the organization's collapse of the runway caused panic among the members, resulting in the intervention of the Public Security and the Social Department.
Finally, the official from the agency responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members, and the situation is relieved.
The initial reaction from many members is that why is it that a part of the physical fitness outlets were affected and were temporarily closed, so consumers can relax and wait for the problem to be solved, which is a big deal, or not.
The biggest cause of the rise of fitness club membership is a deep crisis of confidence in the industry.
The country's traditional gyms generally take the prepaid model, and the money from their customers is the underlying logic behind their development.
By opening new stores to raise cash through membership cards, they seem to be able to cycle back and forth, but in reality are simply hungry for food without a stable profit model.
The negative news about such sectors like the gym runs is often broadcast, and this has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, the gym is certainly a profitable business.
With its ups and downs, the fitness circuit has always been the focus of capital.
Many of the data show that consumption of printing and other sectors is rising and the market continues to warm up.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady increase in the standard of living of residents, the concept of healthy living has become deeply popular, and the fitness industry can grow.
The more the situation improves, the more the industry needs to pay attention to quality of development.
However, some agencies have been blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumption revival. They have just emerged from the crisis and sounded the bells of the opening up of the territory, investing part of the financing in the construction of new stores.
As we have seen in recent years, with the pandemic, there is no denying that the withdrawal of many institutions, the industry reshuffle, and the strong companies are selectively increasing their purchasing power and re-design, which is not a new opportunity.
But if the fitness market is to enter a healthy cycle and take the road to prosperity, the industry must change its traditional model and change its strategy.
Only by standing firm and rebuilding trust, trust and security among the consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.
As opposed to the new stores that are being built to capture the market, the fitness industry needs to focus on optimizing services and developing high quality to retain customers.
First of all, keep users on the service.
The gym is part of service industry, its essence is to stick to user-oriented, to focus on the needs of users, to focus its operations on improving the quality of services.
Second, to improve the user experience through digital transformation.
One is the current popular internet gym model that allows users to pay by the hour and choose the venue themselves.
At the same time, physical and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and achieve complete services from online to offline.
There are no private tuition sales, no huge annual cards, the fear of people running around the gym has been reduced and a sense of trust increased.
It is also necessary to actively explore the diverse professions:
Today, sports consumption has shifted from one service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment surrounding the fitness required or will become a new lever for consumers to have a greater choice.
This is the end.
Buy your refund!
Nanjing property market to pay for the price discrepancy.
Yangzhou Evening News (Journalist: Ma Jun) Yangzhou Evening News / Zhongyuan News found in interview on the 10th, not seen for more than ten years, the price guarantee agreement for the roof has returned to the Nanjing real estate market, a building in Jiangbei New District claiming that the price of the damages compensation for the roof, before handing over other housing sources are more favorable than the previous discount, the developer is willing to buy housing for people change and reimburse the price.
The price guarantee agreement has a number of conditions:
This property, in Jiangbei New District, is called "Bulli Jiaozi", and the owner Mr. Sun told reporters that he found a brick decree on the property that said ○ while building the property last weekend.
According to the photographs, which he sent out to reporters, the developer of the property promised that anyone who had purchased the property between February 1st and February 28th, from the date of the contract of sale, to the date of the delivery, if the discount of the other homes on the project is greater than the discount of previous purchases (... other unsold commodities of the same type, the same building, the same unit, the same property type), the developer can change rooms for the buyer of the house and refund the difference in price.
Mr. Son said that the real estate agent said that this is a price guarantee agreement, the purpose of which is to give the buyer the confidence to do it without having to worry about a development company discount promotion, they are now afraid of buying it and cut it, they do not have time to go to the sales department and they are not worried about it.
It is true that a lot of buyers believe that the price guarantee agreement provides buyers with a certain security, but its conditions are not bad.
Mrs. Yang, who intends to buy a house in Jiangbei, said the guarantee price is first and foremost the same type of house, also in the same building and the same unit, the buyer can compare the price of the home to the source of the price, so the threshold is quite high.
Some buyers argue that because there is an asymmetry of information, the possibility of extra concessions is not ruled out and that it will be difficult for the buyer to defend their rights.
If the buyer remains, it remains to be seen.
According to the report on the property in Nanjing, which was the first in November last year, the property has a total of 252 units in the first two buildings of the building, with a total area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, and the average price for the newly renovated building is 39843 yuan / m2.
However, two months later, online real estate showed that the property is still 157 units, which accounts for 62.3%, with the total number of 128 units on the 8th floor, 113 units, and 44 out of the 124 units on the 7th floor, and only 33 units in the total number of units, which accounts for 13%.
The price guarantee agreement also happened in Nanjing in 2008, according to market sources.
In August of that year, in order to attract house-buyers, the company launched a price guarantee program, with specific terms for the company's strong commitment, if the project's concessions were expanded within a year, the company would return the difference to the old owners, according to the difference.
Since then, in April 2011, nine other properties in Nanjing have also offered to pay the difference in rent between their respective locations.
As the housing market is warming up, there is a need for an injectable pacemaker.
Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the price guarantee is one of the marketing techniques for the company.
He believes that developers now need confidence more than homebuyers do, and the introduction of the price guarantee protocol is actually an incentive for them.
As for whether to keep the buyers, he said it would depend on the effect of several factors, such as regulatory policies and lending threshold, which remains to be seen at this stage.
Multiple data recession Taiwan economy starts year off badly - Xinhua
The manufacturing industry purchasing managers index (PMI) has been tightened for seven months in a row, while the consumer price index (CPI) has seen another 3-digit headline... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have published economic data for January 2023.
Analysts believe Taiwan's economy has made a poor start to the year, and is under increasing pressure to grow.
The Taiwanese region exported $31.51 billion (£37.3 million) in January, down 21.2% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive month of negative growth, according to the Ministry of Finance.
Exports in 11 major export categories declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastics and their products, and optical devices, saw the biggest falls of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1%, the biggest drop in 11 years.
Among them, ICs were down 18.3% per year, the biggest decline in 14 years.
According to the Department of Statistics Director, Wu Menah, this indicates that weak demand in the consumer electronics industry has spread and the electronics industry is entering a period of correction.
Taiwanese imports and exports doubled in January, dropping to $2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
Taiwan authorities have stated that the decreased global terminal demand, industry stock adjustment dampened the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials, export rally is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwanese China Institute of Economic Research, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) of Taiwan's manufacturing industry was 40.4% after a season adjustment in January this year, down 3.3 percentage points from December, marking the seventh consecutive month of contraction.
In the system of economic monitoring indicators, the PMI is the expansion line at 50% and is greater than 50%, which represents the expansion of the economic activity, as opposed to tightening.
The five components of the January Taiwan PMI are: New orders, production and labor cuts, delivery times dropping by suppliers, and stock cuts.
The six major industries reported total PMI contraction, with industries sorted by contraction speed: electrical power equipment equipment industry (35.1%), electronic fluorescent industry (35.2%), chemical, biotech and medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan (GOTCT) has reported that the Taiwan CPI rose by 3.04% in January this year, and has again topped 3% since July last year.
Meanwhile, prices of vegetables rose by 28.25%, setting a 17-month high.
According to Cao Ziyang, the special commissioner in the Taipei Metropolitan Government's Directorate of Public Finances, food prices did rise more than expected, and excluding the Spring Festival, the average CPI in January and February this year should be closer to the 2.71% it was in December last year. Inflation pressure is present and it remains high.
Analysts are pessimistic about the Taiwanese economy this year, the news coverage in Taiwanese media such as the Joint Comprehensive Review and the Yahoo Financial Review.
Professor Yang Taideng, from the Department of Economics at Taipei Central University, has said that the export recession might lead to cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and higher risk of defaulting on debt.
At the same time, the falling orders are leading manufacturers to cut their labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, in turn, impacting consumer spending power.
According to Tsai Da-shi, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economics, the inflation situation in the US and Europe this year is unclear, demand remains at a standstill, and Taiwan's export slump is expected to continue into the first half of the year.
The full-year economic growth will be lower than last year, as Taiwan's economy is based on exports and the slowdown in exports is affecting growth.

How could the content of a consignment have been the kingpin in the emergence of a new variable in the Chinese e-commerce industry?
- China News Network
The new variant in the Chinese e-commerce industry is called 'Wang Yi', but how does a shipment become 'Wang Yi?'
Sharpin, a financial journalist
When we started our eCommerce business it was late, but we understood from the very beginning that content is important in order to stand out from the millions of stores in the market.
Fang Fang, a 90-s-plus girl from Guangdong, who now runs a health food shop at Dengyang e-commerce, has opened the flower of an online store with more than 30 years of history on-line.
With the original soundtrack of Hong Kong movies, classic Chinese songs, and the new @Afanfangon account for the song, the video is amazingly beautiful ≫
At the recent Xiamen Digital Marketplace to find peers, and also a high-quality content sharing platform, Xiang Fang was speaking as the representative of high-quality creators, describing the experience and experience of everyday creation 。
She said in the video, "The video of you grinding the ingredients with such thoroughness caught a lot of attention from online users, many people were interested in the ingredients in my house, and the sale opened up immediately.
I know.
Fung Fang used a cooking video to get more people to fall in love with the taste of the soup of Lao Wang, where a live broadcast sold up to 300,000 items of nourishing foodstuffs, saving her family's old store from collapse.
With the development of short videos and live-streaming businesses, the requirements and standards for content from e-commerce are entering a new phase.
In the early days of the live delivery service, live broadcasters often offered low prices to attract customers, and the price advantage seems to be the only selling point.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal big Vs such as Song Kwon and Oriental Selection, as well as many well-known celebrities and businessmen in the vertical segmentation field, who have improved long-term operating efficiency by continuously creating quality content that fits their brand tone.
Gao Yao, the head of Star Writer Operations for Ye Jian, said that 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through the website in the past year, and the number of creations has increased by 252% and their total sales have more than doubled.
Behind all these numbers, we can sense a thriving and vibrant ecosystem of writers.
He was then arrested by the local police.
Beijing Normal University's Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental platform previously published the content ecology index (ECHI) report, which analyzes the importance of high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective. The index used to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in the country.
According to the E-Commerce Content Ecological Health Index ranking from the above report, Yandex, Snapdeal, Taobao, Badoo and JDNet are in the top five.
According to the report, the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which is to integrate e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC ((professional production content) and UGC ((user original content) is the quality carrier for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the more abundant the scenes for consumption and promotion, the higher the probability of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and consumption of content gradually incorporated in public and private sectors.
On-site, Liu Liu, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University, Chairman of the Professional Committee on the Economy and Management of the Chinese Media, gave an analytical reading of the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from a premium content consumer and accessible content to a premium content consumer that is high-quality, professional and differentiated content that is the hardest currency in the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content becomes fundamental to the new stage of the development of e-commerce, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL ("key opinion leaders") begins to be the standard in e-commerce live broadcasting.
Looking ahead to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Li Qiongming presents two recommendations:
One is to promote the overall level of ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of improving the content structure, to build positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve the content ecological health system index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry.
The other is from an external ecosystem, to achieve healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
The future e-commerce industry also needs more data support and artificial intelligence to predict the future development of stability; In addition, to provide a more regular and healthy growth space for merchants, to realize value synergy among businesses, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to co-create a healthy content eco-system.
The end.

Promoting China-style modernization is a systemic process that requires overall coordination and systemic planning, holistic advancement, proper handling of top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and strategy, consistency and innovation, efficiency and equity, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to a series of important relationships.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for members, vice-commissars of the newly formed CC and key leadership cadres at the provincial level studying how to implement Xi Jinping's new era socialist ideas and 20 major ideals of the party, General Secretary Xi Jinping learned the rules for modernization, explained in more detail and systematically a series of important relationships that need to be dealt with in practice, and provided scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
The advancement of Chinese-style modernization in all fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization, relations with party and state governance, military, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense, etc., requires systematic planning, as well as courage to reform and innovate, and constantly realize comprehensive advancement.
Top-level design requires a deep view of the world's trends, the accuracy of the common aspirations of the masses of people, and a deep exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the planned and policy systems reflect the times, grasp the regularity, and be rich in creativity, close integration, and top-down consistency, and content coordination.
Advancing China-style modernization is a matter of exploration, and there are still many unknown areas that need to be explored boldly in practice and to promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation, never stalling and standing idly by.
The strategic question is the fundamental question of a political party and a country.
To promote China-style modernization, enhance the forward-lookingness of the strategy, to foresee and lead the future with scientific strategy; enhance the comprehensiveness of the strategy, focusing on solving the major problems of the party and state affairs, and acting from the start; enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it must be long-term, thoroughly, and well done.
To scientifically grasp the dialectical unification between strategy and strategy, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of strategy, and to grasp the strategic initiative in accordance with the geography, the situation, and the course of events.
The Chinese people are a nation of right and innovation.
We should maintain the relationship between modernization and innovation, be faithful to the essence, source and root of Chinese-style modernization, unwaveringly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, and put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the time, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize tensions and seek changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly create new advantages of new development, innovative energy, and fully inspire the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
We push Chinese-style modernization forward both to create higher efficiency than capitalism and to safeguard social equity more effectively, better at realizing the combination, promotion, and unification of efficiency and equity.
Managing relationships efficiently and justly, continuing to achieve development for the people, development by the people, and development results shared by the people, so that the benefits of modernization construction are more and more equitable for all people.
In order to achieve China-style modernization, it is necessary to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that the society can be both lively and orderly.
To integrate the two pillars of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly maintain the security of the national regime, institutional security, ideological security and security in key areas;
Increasing the consideration of security factors in development, strengthening national security capabilities through development, applying development results to strengthen the foundation of national security, and creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating the vitality of development, achieving high quality development and high level of security.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, one must stick to one's own path, and open our eyes to the world, to remain open to the outside world, and continue to expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must insist upon our independence and sovereignty and self-reliance, insisting on placing the development of the state and our nation on the basis of our own strength, insisting on holding the fate of our country's development and progress firmly in our own hands.
We should expand the openings to the outside world at a high level, participate deeply in the division of labor and cooperation of global industry, make the best use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win.
It is a path, a way to go far.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, under the guidance of Xi Jinping's New Era Socialist Ideology and Science, grasp the rules, be diligent, show full activity, initiative and creativity, correctly manage a series of important relations, and actively work on a new journey of building the socialist modern state and continuously open a new horizon of Chinese-style modernisation.
The Biden administration on Friday blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the balloon spy program.
The US Department of Commerce said the five Chinese companies and one research institute are assisting in the modernization of the Chinese military, especially its aerospace programs including flying boats and aircraft.
It is difficult for blacklisted companies to have access to U.S. technology exports.
The list is called the Entity List, and firms on it cannot purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they receive a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies included in the blacklist are: Beijing Nanyang Heating and Air Technology Co.,Ltd., 48th Institute of Electronics and Technology Group, Dongguan Liangqiang Space Remote Sensing Technology Co.,Ltd., Xiamen Aerospace Technology Group Co.,Ltd., Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co. Ltd. and Shanxi Xiamen Aviation Technology Group Co.,Ltd.
Before this, the White House said it was considering broader measures to expose and deal with broader surveillance activity by China that threatens U.S. national security.
The balloon incident further escalated tensions between China and the US and U.S. Secretary of State Blinken cancelled a planned visit to China.
After the United States dropped the balloon on February 4, the Chinese government asked the U.S. Embassy in China to intervene, criticizing the United States for severely affecting and damaging the efforts and processes to stabilize China-U.S. relations on both sides.
Based on available evidence from the wreckage and information from Chinese military procurement platforms, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon had direct ties to the PLA and was approved by the Chinese military as the supplier.
During a press conference on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said that the Chinese side has repeatedly clarified its position on the incident of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle inadvertently entering US airspace by force majeure.
According to the Foreign Ministry website, she added that the relevant resolution in the US Congress was nothing more than political manipulation and bluff.
The Chinese side strongly dislikes this and firmly opposes it.
Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce Matthew Axelrod, said, "Today's action demonstrated our collective efforts to identify and deter the Chinese use of spy balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and over 40 other countries".
I know.
Reuters reported that an employee at Tian Haesung Aviation Technology Co.,Ltd. in Guangzhou said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on the information.

The miraculously successful rescue case has brought some light to the hopeful search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the number of victims continues to rise.
As of today, according to official statistics, the earthquake that occurred on Monday has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say that people will be trapped in the rubble for no longer than a week at most, the hopes of finding more survivors are growing.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imagers to look for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue effort began to shift to helping survivors who are in dire need of help.

The epicentre was located in the Pacific Ocean east of Sendai City, the capital of Miyagi prefecture. The epicenter of the earthquake was at a depth of 24 km, and triggered a huge tsunami that rose to a maximum height of 40.1 meters.
The earthquake was the first earthquake in Japan to be recorded over a magnitude 9.
Some 22,000 people died in the disaster, and about 400,000 buildings were completely destroyed or collapsed.
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a leak caused by the tsunami.
The accident is classified as the 7th worst in the International Nuclear Event Classification (INES).
The Fukushima nuclear accident led to measurements of trace amounts of radioactive material worldwide, including cesium-131, cesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years).
Large amounts of radioactive isotopes were released into the Pacific Ocean as a result of the nuclear accident.
According to the United Nations, at least 870,000 people are in dire need of food in the Syrian-Turkish conflict zone.
In Syria alone, as many as 5.3 million people were displaced by the earthquake.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is appealing for $77 million to provide food to people displaced by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.
The temperature in the affected area is below freezing, and many of the affected people are homeless.
The Turkish government has distributed large quantities of hot food, tents and blankets, but those supplies are still hard to get to the people in need.
But in Syria, which has been deeply embroiled in a 12 year civil war, the earthquake added to the suffering of the people.
In the four days after the earthquake, the World Food Program has provided food assistance to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has sent 72 tons of medical supplies for trauma treatment and emergency surgery.

Google's AI chatbot answers the wrong question and the stock price of its parent company evaporates to $100 billion.
(A synthesis of the 11th)
Google's new chatbot Bard, badly misinterpreted in a promotional video and given wrong answers, caused the stock price of Alphabet, Google's parent company, to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, evaporating to $110 billion (RM4,765 million), up from $94.57 (RM8,640 million) as of Friday's close.
The market fears that Alphabet will fall short of its rival Microsoft.
Google posted a short video on social media earlier to promote the AI chatbot Bard, and as reported by Bloomberg, a person asked Bard, "What new things can I tell my 9-year-old about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
In his response, Joan Bard mentioned that the telescope took the first photograph of an exoplanet in the solar system.
However, according to NASA, the first photograph of an extrasolar planet was taken by the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
On April 30, 2011, the stock price of Alphabet dropped sharply after a wrong answer from Bard, which has been widely reported by Reuters.
Google, on the other hand, notes that Bard's feedback pump underscores the importance of a rigorous testing process, combining external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response pump meets high standards based on quality, safety and genuine information.
Singapore's tourism recovery strong, with inbound visitors up 19 times in 2021
The Singapore Tourism Board recently disclosed that it expects 12 to 14 million international visitors to visit Singapore in 2023, bringing in about S$18 billion to S$21 billion of tourism revenue; and that visitor arrivals and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of pre-pandemic levels in 2019; and that a full-fledged recovery in the tourism industry in 2024, is very likely.
The Singapore tourism market will be restarted and revived in 2022.
Statistics released recently by the Singapore Tourism Board show that inbound visitors increased 19-fold to 6.3 million in 2022 from 33.06 million in 2021, exceeding earlier estimates of 4 to 6 million, and has returned to 33 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.
The Singapore tourism revenue, which totaled S$8.96 billion from January to September 2022, is expected to reach S$13.8 to S$14.3 billion for the full year of 2022, up six to seven times from the S$1.89 billion in 2021, having already recovered to a level of approximately 50% to 52% before the coronavirus outbreak in 2019.
Singapore government has taken several steps to speed up the recovery of tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced nearly S$500 million to stimulate the tourism sector's recovery.
The Ministry of Tourism recently announced that it plans to allocate about 110 million yuan from the budget over the next two years to introduce more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make wellness one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board (TSB) has issued a call for proposals on 23 November 2022 for the development of a wellness attraction on Singapore's southern coast.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put their health first in various considerations.
The development of a health spa in the Penang Southern District, home of Penang Bay Gardens and the Penang Dams, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, and allow tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Mr Chen Jianlong, director of Singapore Tourism Authority, said health and wellness will be a significant part of Singapore's tourism product in the coming years.
The coronavirus pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
Therefore, for the last two years, the tourism office has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists.
In June 2022, Singapore Tourism Board will host its first Healthy Living Festival, with more than 130 health activities and experiences for the public to enjoy.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at Swan Bay Gardens, the Central Beach Market in Saontawa, the new gallery for exploring new areas of the arts at the Museum of Arts and Science, as well as the new open air theatre at the nightlife Zoo, the Tourism Authority will support the development and update of projects such as the Bird Park in the World of All Wildlife that will make Singapore an attractive international destination.
As planned, Singapore will adopt related industry standards for sustainable tourism in meetings, conferences and incentives by 2023, with a focus on improving both waste management and carbon emissions, further optimising the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism has accelerated the recovery of its aviation sector.
According to the figures, as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered strongly, with up to 150,000 passengers per day and nearly 1 million per week, equivalent to about 75% of pre-coronavirus levels, and the number of airline employees have also recovered to about 90% of pre-coronavirus levels.
The figures show that in January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, which is 42% of the pre-coronavirus rate, and 170,000 flights, 53% of the pre-coronavirus rate.
The fast recovery of the tourism industry is driving the recovery of other industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
The Singaporean government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
According to Kwon Tan, Assistant Director of the Singapore Tourism Board's International Division, a survey conducted by the travel platform China Travel, Singapore's safety score is among top 3 in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, around 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacations per year.
With China's easing of border controls, the number of Chinese visitors is expected to return this year to between 30% and 60% in 2019.
Kurupandan noted that the Tourism Bureau will now be closely monitoring China's signal on the future release of its outbound travel policy in response to the changing demands of tourists.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agents such as Travel Asia, Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in Chinese overseas travel.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the recovery of the tourism sector will be faster than expected as long as there are no significant recessions affecting public revenues and no new large-scale deadly epidemics, as well as other factors affecting the global economy.
Kim Jong Un interacts with his daughter; wife is left behind
Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Jong-il was in the parade of troops marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the state, as well as standing on the podium with her father.
KCNA has released a video of Kim Eil Jae standing by his father, looking at him and talking to him and his father, holding his face with her hands and even touching his chest in an interactive manner that is broadcast all over the country.
The first lady, Lee Hsien Loong, however, can only step back.
In an official photo taken of Kim Jong Un and his wife Lee Hyun-hee at a dinner with their daughter Kim Hyun-hye on July 7, Kim Hyun-hye not only rarely sits in C-seat in the middle of his parents but she also took the chairman's desk with Kim Jong-il during the parade for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army (KPR) on the following night.
Official North Korean media released a video of a military parade on North Korean Central Television in the aftermath of the tragedy, revealing more intimate scenes of the couple's father and daughter.
Kim Jong Un looked at her daughter a couple of times on the podium, and the smiles on their faces never returned and they whispered in each other's ears, and Kim Jong Il held up his father's arms with his hands, while Kim Jong Un responded with a laugh.
Other official media images showed Kim Jae Hee and Kim Jong Un, sitting on a sofa chair in an apartment, touching their father's face with their hands; and her hand touching Kim Jong Un's chest while walking, holding hands with him.
The First Lady Li Shi was only able to walk in the back or to sit on the side for the entire journey, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
The Korean media has noted that Kim Jong Un's exposure has been increasing for the past three months since his first public appearance at the launch of the Mars 17 rocket on November 18 last year, and this is his fifth appearance in public to date.
The North Korean state media has used honorifics such as "dearest son" and "dearest noble son" when referring to Kim Jong-un, and has broadcast footage of Kim repeatedly shouting swears to defend the Caucasian heritage while the leader watches the parade from the podium.
Those signs raise doubts whether Kim Jong-il is already designated as the heir to the Kim clan. The Washington Post's analysis sees this as a sign that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-age daughter to succeed him, though there are some who believe such judgment is premature and that there are still various possibilities in the case of a son under Kim Jong-un.
The U.S. nonfarm employment data in January exceeds expectations and future trends - Economic Observatory Network - Professional financial news website
Q: How do you feel about the bigger than expected nonfarm employment data in January and future trends for China?
A: January 3, 2021 U.S. Department of Labor nonfarm employment data for January 2023; 5.17,000 new nonfarm jobs, significantly above the 189,000 market expectation; unemployment rate decreased to 3.4%, the lowest level in almost 50 years; hourly wage growth 4.4%, compound annual growth 0.3%, slightly slower.
In total, the data is distorted by a number of one-off and technical factors, such as striking teachers who have been on strike, a modification to the survey caliber and an update of the seasonal factors, which may be corrected later ((reference January 2022 non-farm growth is from 504,000 to 364,000) and the employment of non-farm people may not be as strong as the data shows.
Structurally, the impact of cuts in high-tech firms is still there, but at a lower rate, with significant new employment increases in high-touch service sectors such as leisure hospitality, education and healthcare, with data showing that there remains a labor gap in the service sector.
Combined with the likewise over-expected recovery of service PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data, and the strength of the consumer credit data, we judge that the US services industry has been able to recover very quickly after the extreme weather and holiday season.
We believe that the supply and demand tensions in the US labor market will be hard to improve without a recession.
Currently, the U.S. labor market is over 5 million short-term job vacancies, and the labor force participation rate is slowly rising, especially among the 25-54 age group which is now approaching the pre-pandemic highs.
Beyond this, stronger consumer demand due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit of residents of the United States will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the labor market.
The continued tension between supply and demand in the US labor market will be the underbelly of the US economy in 2023.
With the end of the stack of interest rate increases and repeated inflationary forecasts, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Until this release, the U.S. equity and debt markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path to hikes.
As the inflation numbers continue to improve, the Fed continues to maintain the delicate balance of market inflation expectations while reducing its rate hikes, but the market is blind to the Fed's pro-confrontation rhetoric, and is not only expecting an early halt to the rate hike, but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
With the labor market tight in supply and demand, and the impact of austerity policy uncertain, we believe the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year was relatively reasonable, as the market expected extreme adjustments and trading overcrowd may do some damage to the market.
However, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapidly declining inflation, as the M2 data overlaps, and the leading indicators of the various CPI components have gradually turned. The US CPI data has been shifted to a phase of rapid decline since October, the persistence of wage growth is only a support for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are not easy to falsify, after the release of the next inflation data or enter a new round of play.
The founder of Sugizu, Yang Yonggang died of a sudden heart attack after leading the first transformation of Chinese clothing. - Economic Observer
WeChat public notice issued by the certified entity WeChat Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the "Suguj Holding Company") issued on February 11, the founder of Suguj, the chairman of the board of Suguj, died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac illness and ineffective treatment.
In the 1980s, Zeng was the head of the state-owned cotton and silk mill, which he later turned over. In 1989, Zeng became the head of the Ningbo Yunsheng Clothing Factory, the predecessor of Shuiji Shares.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd China Business Future Yearly Celebrations, Yang Yumangang said that in the 1990s, the market share of the Suzhou brand in the Chinese western market was as high as 37%.
In 1996, SONGZONG SHARES ((600884.SH) went public, the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, the Susuk Group began to transform, as Wu Yeonggang realized that once the market opened, Chinese brands would naturally form a tiered brand market, and that Susuk's clothes would remain in the spotlight and unlikely to become the country's national clothing for a long time.
In 1999, Sugi began researching enterprise transformation, and Zhong Yonggang recalled the year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation really does, we found a lot of specialist academics, and we held various debates, workshops and seminars".
Finally, we set two major strategic directions:
The first is the use of new energy and new materials, and the other is the future of great health.
After the strategic direction was determined, Suzuki started to look for cooperation. At that time, the Busan Institute of Thermal Energy's Carbon Institute was doing the national 863 project for aluminum, and the research funding was not enough. Suzuki and Suzuki signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 phosphates microcarbon spherical projects in the field of nitrogen and magnesium, and engaged in the research, production, and sales of negative polar materials, and the commercial promotion of negative polar materials in the country.
In 2001, the company achieved large scale production of intermediate-phase carbon nanoparticles, began domestic substitution, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate-phase carbon nanoparticles in the country.
This is the first lithium-ion battery negative materials production company in China, achieving the indigenisation of lithium-ion battery negative materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugihiro began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium electrochemical materials business was written into the main business of Sugihiro stock, and the revenue share of the clothing business declined year by year, until 2013, the revenue of the lithium electrical materials business of Sugihiro stock completely exceeded the clothing business.
In February 2021, Sugihisa Securities successfully merged with the LG Chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and founded the polarizer company Sugihisa, a technology field with relatively high technical content. Sugihisa's main competitors are the top 500 companies in the world, such as Samsung of Korea, Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, and JD Electric.
Liu Yungang shared some of his experiences with post-investment management, and why private Chinese companies that have been taking over some of the world's top high-tech companies have such a low probability of success.
Because people think that I spent so much money, I have to send people to deal with it, this is the usual behavior. However, the day of the successful acquisition of Sagami, Song Yongkang is different, Song Yongkang goes to Sagami Kingu Electric public announcement, Sugami as a major shareholder in Sagami Kingu, decided to implement a two-way system, except for Song Yongkang as chairman, the people of Sagami Kingu do not send to Sagami, taking the authorized way of operating, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management, etc.

The E account of the Hedge Fund is blocked: the SEC authorized the development of all funds under the name of investors for aggregation and searching. - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website
As a result of the complexity of the purchase channels, is it difficult to gather account information about the funds?
Do you always forget about the little gold box?
The problems of the KiM people are about to be solved.
On February 10, the SEC announced that the E account of the EAPP was released on mobile app stores and was available in public trial.
It is reported that the Fund for Moneylenders E account provides a one-stop Moneylenders e-enquiry service for individual investors to provide fund-for-fund accounts and share information, aimed at solving the pain points of the industry such as forgetting accounts, burdensome inquiries and other industry services for small and medium-sized investors.
According to data from Wind, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 PE fund managers in the country, managing funds of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 PE fund share register agencies and 411 PE funds sales agencies.
The account systems of the quota registries are independent of each other and do not have a unified channel of inquiry.
According to industry experts, at the end of 2021, more than 720 million people in China, or half of the population, had invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to inquire about the purchase through the various sales organizations, but through the E account of the fund, they could find information about all sales channels.
What is the APP of the Penguin Fund?
According to the documents, the E-account Application for Equity Funds is the Chinese settlement of the ETF industry portal mobile application developed and approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It provides investors with a one-stop enquiry of the off-the-shelf holding of the entire market of the ETF products.
Investors can easily and quickly see their holdings of OTC fund products of the fund managers through the various sales channels throughout the market through the OTC fund E Account, which improves the efficiency of queries.
Specifically, the information that investors can access through the Liquidity E Account window includes: information about fund accounts opened at various fund managers in the market, information about trading accounts opened at public fund sales agencies, and information about the number of out-of-pocket holdings in products such as pooled asset management plans established by publicly traded securities investment funds and securities management companies, the number of investors established without the limit of 200.
Yang Yi Qi, chief operating officer of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told Economic Observer Network reporters that investors can access all their OTC fund holdings through the OTF's E account OTC app, helping them recover forgotten asset classes, and more importantly, complete account information about the consolidated fund investment situation has been consolidated for the customers to help customers have a timely, accurate and complete grasp of their own investment situation, so they can optimize their fund portfolio, better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register?
As a journalist I noticed that at present, the App is available in mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO and vivo, but the app is still in its public trial run. Registration requires filling in the invitation code, which investors can contact the fund manager of the fund.
A customer service representative with a large Shanghai-based IPO fund presented a 6-digit invitation card to the Economic Watch News, telling the reporter that in the test phase of the RAPP, China is allocating a certain number of invitations to each fund manager, and when investor phones came, we would all give them.
After the trial ends, the invitation code is no longer required to open the user registry.
I know.
The registration of the account and enquiry of the related documents according to the official website of the SEC. The whole process takes a few minutes and is divided into four steps: user registration, real name verification, fund account binding, public fund enquiry.
After verifying your name, press the Fund bind button of the asset table, all fund products purchased through various fund sales platforms are presented in the list of binding options (.the account can be tied), After completion of the binding can see the total assets of the fund and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the E-account window of the hedge fund provides an enquiry service for investors and does not offer redemption.
The data date shown in the E account window of the hedge fund generally moves forward by three trading days from the date of the query to the user's T (T day).
For example, if an E account is opened on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and net worth on the asset page will be moved forward on that date by three trading days, i.e., February 7.

US and Fiji reach defense consensus against Communist China
On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The Philippines and China reached an agreement against aggression in the South and East China seas, and the Philippine leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they will have substantive defense exchanges by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States against Chinese hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishimoto hopes the meeting will help the two countries to develop policies to address the Taipei crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China earlier this year in January and was awarded a $20 billion deal.
But after this, relations between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but have declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to U.S. troops in order to guarantee security in the South China Sea.
One new base added is 300 km away from Taiwan and is one of the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US may take action at bases in the Philippines.
According to the Japanese media, now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build a "frictionless" arc in the Western Pacific to push forward regional cooperation.
Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Party Sharlee in a speech: Welcome to Green Camp on the basis of the consensus of September
During the visit, Vice Chairman of the Taiwanese Chinese Nationalist Party, Liu Shaoqi, will meet with the Chairman of the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, Liu Yunshan and Wang Yanming, the Permanent Secretary of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China.
Chen Chunsan, a senior adviser to the National Political Foundation, the official organ of the Kuomintang, in an interview with the Taiwan Central News Agency late last night, positively evaluated what Liu said about Liu Xiaoli, and stated that China welcomes the Green Camp to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the Confucian Consensus and oppose Taiwanese independence.
The National Party view that this is a new thing.
The news of the day did not mention that Shah had spoken with Kim earlier in the day.
The ruling Taiwanese Democratic Party (PDP) has clarified its refusal to accept the 1992 consensus.
According to the official news agency, Nationalist Party Deputy Chairman Xi Jinping is in Beijing to meet with Wang Yining, the deputy head of the CPC Central Political Bureau, Li Ying, the new director of the State Bureau, and Li Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
Xi Linlian spoke in the meeting that the political basis of the National Communist Party is the 92-year Consensus and anti-Taiwan independence, while Yang Chun-shan, senior adviser to the Nationalist Party State Policy Foundation, said in the meeting that the CN's 92-year Consensus is the original 92-year Consensus.
This is different from the feeling of previous meetings that I participated in.
Recent video conferences with mainland scholars, and this one, did not hear the Taiwanese scholars talk about unification and de-escalation, but instead about restoring communication and dialogue.
Yang Jun-shan noted that the two sides are threatened by a fierce war and the Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intentions to improve relations through the Kuomintang Party.
Since there is no mutual trust between the two, both sides are willing to do their bit for Taiwan, and the two sides don't want to spoil the relations between the two sides.
According to Liu Chunshan, Wang Chening himself personally told Liu to adhere to the demand of the Taiwanese farmers and fishermen and if this is not a general solution, it needs to be dealt with on a case by case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Nationalist Party visitor to the mainland would directly mention the daily interference of Chinese warplanes and warships, the problem of farming and fishing in Taiwan's small county towns, or whether the interview of a reporter from the Central News Agency raised such questions.
Law unions again rally against government pension reform bill
On Saturday (11 February), the French trade unions renewed their mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling for people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of the social movement against the government's pension reform bill.
The number of people who responded to the call for action, could affect the next action plan of the trade union movement.
This was the fourth national mobilization of France's eight largest trade union groups in a month, and the first time the protest rally had been scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, and they do not have to choose between a protest protest and a walkout, the trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more people.
The bus system, the metro and the public transport companies unions did not call for a strike today, the bus system should be running normally, citizens can ride to the assembly venue and in the area where the schools are opening during the winter holidays, people can take their normal holidays.
The unions are hoping for more than a million people to take part in today's rally, while the police are expecting nationwide attendance of between 600,000 and 800,000, and 90,000 to 120,000 in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the protests against the government's pension reforms began, while polls show a majority of French people do not support the move to raise the legal retirement age from its current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to protest has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on 31 January gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people throughout the country.
The mass demonstration on Tuesday (7 February) narrowed to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
This pension reform is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The number of amendment proposals submitted by the opposition, especially the group led by the radical left, made the process of consideration very slow.
The conflict between the North and the South has become more intense.
A member of the parliament from the far left party France Insoumise recently posted on social media a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the labour minister, prompting protests from the ruling party.
Finally the Speaker of the National Assembly suspended the MP from parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
While the proposed reform has prompted the biggest social movement in France in more than 20 years, so far, the government has not made any major concessions despite some modest adjustments.
The unions have already prepared for a further strike next Thursday, March 16, and plan to demonstrate on March 7, when the reforms are sent to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages high fertility rates through sperm donation to universities
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan province in China, on the 9th, started a campaign to recruit university graduates and high school students to donate their sperm. Successful donation of 8 to 12 times will earn a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
According to Taipei Media, the announcement went viral on Weibo and prompted initiatives in other provinces, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to the Free Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
In addition to academic qualifications, a donor must be at least 170 cm tall, have five limbs straight, no visible hair loss, and short-sightedness cannot be more than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Database of Yunnan province notes that sperm donors can receive a full set of male medical examinations worth 1000 RMB, especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done, meaning it is important to know their reproductive status.
Donor requirements include a height of 165 cm or more, having university degree or higher or studying, being colorblind, suffering from a genetic disease or infectious disease such as hepatitis B.
The report cites China's Tianjin News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank in Shanxi Province has printed a poster with the words "Yummy with paid sperm donation, infinite glory" to encourage young people to donate, and encouraging netizens to send related messages, "Yummy with unlimited love".
The price in Shanxi province is higher than in Yunnan; eligible men and women can receive 300 yuan in cash each time, and donors who complete a certain number of times can receive a subsidy of 5000 yuan.
The highest known price is in Beijing, with the highest subsidy of 5150 yuan.
The last Communist Chancellor of East Germany died today
Hans Modrow died last night at the age of 95, the successor to the East German Communist Party reports the party in a statement.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
I know.
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic state.
At that time, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes to take place in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow declared the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election result meant he was no longer Prime Minister.
Despite Maduro's reforms, opponents accuse him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not imprisoned.
Some say the allegations are politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994, and as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the former East Germany to return, but said its achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland), and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as chief of the Youth Fire Brigade and soon after the end of the conflict he became a member of the Volkssturm, the Nazi militia organization that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 for the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took an anti-fascist course and became a committed Communist Party member.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he found a job as a mechanic on his return and continued to study social sciences and economics, obtaining his PhD.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth movement, which almost all East German youth joined, and was promoted through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) to chairman of the Dresden regional party from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, the highest state office.
Hackers in support of Iranian revolutionary anniversary hack the presidential TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ibrahim Raisi.
The president's televised live speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute when a banner of a group of anti-government hackers named Edalat Ali () appeared on the screen.
There was also a cry saying, "Death to the Islamic Republic!"
Iranian state TV was hacked on the anniversary of the revolution, Reuters reported today.
On the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Lacey's hardline government faced its greatest challenge yet from the young protesters demanding their ouster, but Lacey still called on the deceived youth to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests continue in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in the custody of the country's Moral Police in September.
The deadly crackdown on protests by Iranian security forces is one of the most powerful challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities have freed jailed dissidents Fahad Messami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on Friday, as part of a hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty order that included prisoners arrested during the recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters have been killed, including 71 minors, according to HRANA, a human rights group.
More than 70 government security personnel were reported to have been killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters were believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and the official media have been calling for votes in Saturday's rally to show their opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the eve of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Friday night, the official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)
However, many could be heard at the gathering shouting "Death to the dictator!"
The death of the Islamic Republic was reported on Twitter and in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, state television broadcast live video of the official rallies across the country.
In Tehran, as part of official celebrations, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed.
Lacy's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan, "Death to America", which is the signature slogan at state conventions.
The crowd shouted, "Away with Israel!"
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters has said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison for national security charges in 2020.
They later put her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
A week before his release, supporters warned that he was at risk of death in a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory hijab.
In response to Adelkhah's release, the French Foreign Ministry called on Friday for her to be freed, including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.

Did the balloon incident brighten up America's eyes?
Increasing restrictions on technology exports to China
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the United States is prepared to further tighten its technology exports to China following the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials said the balloon events highlight the national security threat posed by China and will seek more political support for enhanced U.S. technological protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works for the Washington think tank Center for a New American Security.
This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the hardliners' point of view of China.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that "we'll be considering broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger-scale surveillance activities that constitute a threat to our national security and that of our allies and partners".
American officials said they have alerted governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and that international coordination was vital in responding to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, newly established House of Representatives Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China may put pressure on the United States to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She said members of Congress will feel the growing pressure to take a tougher stance, which may force the White House to take a tougher line.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that many proponents of stricter export controls are also pushing for broader controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also developing a foreign investment screening program to assess US investment overseas for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls for the program to be launched sooner.
The day after the Syrian earthquake relief
Since the earthquake hit Turkey and neighbouring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried in the rubble.
In the cold temperatures, they often call for silence, as they struggle to hear any sound of life through the rotting concrete.
Two more women were rescued from the rubble, days after they survived the quake, according to a report by Reuters today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has soared to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, and in Syria more than 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Monday, which was followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 31,000 people, and the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
After the deadliest earthquake in the area in 20 years, two women were trapped for 122 hours after rescuers rescued the two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey, Turkish authorities said Saturday.
Another of the injured, identified as Masallah Cicek, a 55-year-old man, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they tried to hear any sound of life from the broken concrete piles.
In Samandag district, Turkey, rescuers, crouched under concrete boards whispering "Inshallah" to one another, carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old baby.
He opened his eyes, then the infant Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a blanket and carried to a field hospital.
Video images show that rescuers also took his mother, who was lying face-blind on a stretcher, with a faint white face, but conscious.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters late night that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the last 24 hours, while 31,000 rescuers were deployed to the affected areas.
About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people have been displaced by the earthquake and are crammed into temporary shelters.
As many people have run out of food during the cold winter conditions, people are increasingly questioning the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma travelled to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit to the disaster-hit region since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war has complicated rescue efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adana province, and he admitted that the government's response is not as fast as expected.
Opponents took this issue as a pretext to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in the May 14 vote, which may be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over delays in delivering aid and rescue operations could influence the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge for Erdogan's 20 years in power.
In a blog post, Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called the "negative campaign of bribery for political gain".
Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu criticized the reaction of the government.
Critics say the quake was big, but worse than the quake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

In the morning of February 11, Prime Minister Van Minh Dung and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) during their official visit to Brunei Darussalam.
The University of Brunei is the largest centre for higher education and scientific research in Brunei, ranking third in the region among universities.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei formally established the partnership with FPT University in Vietnam, mainly in the field of English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei also includes Vietnamese in the curricula.
During her visit to Brunei University, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Ms Van Minh, spoke with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Van Myong is pleased that more and more foreigners are learning Vietnamese, and thus contribute actively to the promotion of the Vietnamese culture and identity around the world.
Prime Minister Van Minh Chieu expressed his confidence and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at Brunei University will grow stronger and stronger; the students in Vietnamese language classes will be more and more interested in Vietnamese, will study hard, will be able to speak Vietnamese fluently, and will become ambassadors for bilateral friendly cooperation between the countries.
The Prime Minister also used the opportunity to interact via video with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Centre in Hangzhou to learn about their learning, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Phan Minh Tri believes that the partnership between FPT University of Vietnam and Brunei University, especially the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a living symbol of the education cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.

In his discussion with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leaders of Brunei University, Prime Minister Van Diemen praised the results of educational collaboration between the two countries, including the collaboration between FPT and Brunei University, as well as the introduction of Vietnamese language in the curricula.
PM Van Minh hopes that Brunei University will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese teaching and further expanding the size of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan also appreciated the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the memorandum of understanding on educational cooperation signed in April 2014. He recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Van Minh highly appreciates the establishment of the first campus in Southeast Asia of Brunei University in Vietnam; believes that the university is growing stronger in the region and the world; further expanding cooperation with higher education institutions in Vietnam.
The Prime Minister and his wife planted a tree in the university campus in Brunei, along with some notes in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Van Minh wished the University of Brunei to continue to develop, contribute more and more for the educational cause in Brunei, and cooperate more closely with various education and training institutions in Vietnam.

The proposal was agreed and supported by the leaders of both countries.
In particular, Prime Minister Van Diem also shared with the leaders of the two countries their aspiration for a community of unity, peace, stability and prosperity in ASEAN, and agreed to maintain solidarity and collaboration with ASEAN countries and enhance its central role in a complex and changing context of regional and international situations.
Taking advantage of the outcome, Premier Wang Yi's official visit to Singapore and Brunei made an active contribution to the effective implementation of the 13th VC Foreign Policy's priority line to strengthen relations with ASEAN neighbours, the effective implementation of the Conclusions 12 (No. 12-KL/TW) of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam on the new situation, and the exercise of strength in national solidarity.

What was the plutonium that was dropped over Alaska?
who are deluded, doubters.
The U.S. military used its most advanced stealth fighter, the F-22, again on Friday afternoon to shoot down an unidentified object flying above Alaska.
The site of the crash was 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time the US military shot down a flying object in less than a week.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down off the coast of South Carolina, days after it drifted into US airspace.
The second object, the Pentagon said, first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday evening, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), the size of a small car, and much smaller than the previously downed Chinese hydrogen balloon.
The Pentagon also believes there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.
John Cobb, the White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the shape of the high-altitude object is not yet clear, it posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian airplanes.
Corby says that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, is not equipped with a hanging cargo pod.
Corby says that we call it a "rogue object", which is the best description we can come up with.
President Biden consulted the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down, and he was very careful in his decision, Coby added.
The US official description of the object could be summarized as "about the size of a small car, with no rudder, no suspension, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters".
The information does not address basic questions such as what the object is, what country it belongs to, and what its purpose is.
Many of the analysts and speculations online suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.
It could have come from China like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon which flicked over Latin America, but they were doing some kind of mission in different places.
The mysterious object in Alaska has been linked to the sighting of UFOs.
U.S. Newsweek, citing tweets from former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer on Friday, tweeted that he hopes that the UFO was a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO.
The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not enough to provoke an interstellar conflict, said Mayer.
Megger's tweet came shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object had been shot down in Alaska.
Newsweek has written that more than one person suspected that the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett criticized the administration's cover-up last month and called for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on missing UFOs.
Amazon's customer service is hard to believe
It's estimated that very few people have seen it, but I will also tell you something.
When we bought the dress, it was a hooded shirt, but at the end I was given a pair of shorts.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted the customer service of Amazon, who confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer said to resolve this, and then immediately saw the item names turned into shorts, the link that I bought was off the shelf.
The customer service can either retain the merchandise for a certain amount, or return the item.
This is how Amazon does it?
It is hard to believe that the clothing itself is not my problem and, as a consumer, I ask for what I deserve, without making any extravagant demands, and Amazon has changed its name, saying there's no stock.
This is my first long post, and hopefully not my last.
The Unfathomable Sleeve
The coated fabric is quite hard but if you look closely, there are many cracks that it is not clear whether it is leather, and the sleeve of the dress is really hard to understand. The sleeves are usually longer than the jacket, but usually 1-2 cm. The length is about 5 cm, the arms should be in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves are covered by the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and easy to return them.
But when will the money be back?
The clothes are nice to have, since the prints are small, they have to be returned, but it's been more than a week since the return but I haven't received the refund yet!
And for customers to make a purchase on their own, contacting an untrustworthy Pinnacle Express company, is the worst thing that they've ever done since buying from Amazon!
It's just that the store is good, they actively help in making the returns on time, but the real work done by the express service at Peak Express is quite irritating, it takes about half a month to make a return, and this partnership is to drag the back legs of Amazon, low work efficiency, no service awareness!
More for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, colour and feel are very good, soft/thin to medium thickness, no smell of petrol.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2 ft 5, maximum size 4 ft, 1.79 / 80 kg wearing a slight tight waist.
It seems that there is no loose belt at the waist, which makes it difficult to loosen the waist.
Plus, it is uncomfortable to wear the mask.
Very good. It's not very bright.
I bought it, I made over two hundred, so what's going on?
First time that Amazon cooperates with the daily courier, the first delivery was not at home, later we made an appointment for two deliveries, the courier didn't deliver, and then returned the order directly to me, this fucking courier didn't have any integrity, and strongly recommended not to use the daily courier again
This time, a shirt returned to me, and the price went up by over a hundred dollars.
Amazon should not have this kind of product.
This is a nice product to buy at a special price, it is not cheap, it was very nice to see the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned by the large area of wear on the surface of the product, there was wear in several other places, and not the secondary product was the old product, as will be shown later on.
So I asked for a refund, the manufacturer saw my picture and said it was because of the shipping, isn't that bullshit?
How can the inside of a product be worn?
There are only two possibilities, either I had used the product, or I deliberately damaged the product and returned it.
Objectively, I have no evidence that I didn't damage goods, but based on my credit record of Amazon purchases, I think that such goods should not appear in Amazon self-service products, the customer choosing Amazon self-service is trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, hope you will work together to improve, thank you.
I use the product for less than a year, and there's two E2s, and I don't know how to do it?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two sets at the right of the receiver often appear red E2, it should be a problem with the launch module, which does not quite match the 7 years of sustainable operation of the launch module mentioned on the Amazon site, I am not able to find it on the Amazon website after it was sold, now I don't know how good it is?
Let's keep going.
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the machine was broken.
And always blank.
We will change it later.
The transfer was quick, the view was a little hazy at night, not very wide, but it was enough for the average household.
I don't think it's enough to have a card, to buy it myself, and to have bought a mobile phone on Amazon.
A sticker would be on the package, to prevent the package from being opened, this time not, and when buying a mobile phone, there would be the same sticker section which could be on the warranty card, this time not.
I don't know if it was cheap or not, I'm confused.
Waiting for a response from the supplier
It didn't have any markings, I called the supplier directly and the answer was without markings, as suspected but can use the borders to post it to the JSON company to verify the goods, and also leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message to inform me to enter my information in the JSON official website warranty card, so far no texts are received?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are safe to use.
The master who changed the oil said it was very bright and that the oil was really good.
This is the second time I have bought one.
So it was a relief.
This was a fast delivery, the packaging was not picky, the oil was used, the engine noise decreased significantly.
The price is very good, it is difficult to find synthetic oil for less than $200.
Support the stars, support the winning cards, protect the car.
Japanese Amazon suffered big buyer losses due to customer service issues ((8c worm delivery at 8cm worm)) ((8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c))
Admitted to error, but I am always recommending and always emphasizing that the goods are third party and not binding on third parties.
The order number is 503-4265464-1830254.
I initially bought the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c and at that time thought it was a trap, so I called the Japanese Chinese customer service and clearly told them the 8 was 8c, but when the same goods returned to China I discovered only 8 cm, I thought this was a trap set to trap the Chinese (according to the Amazon sale), and now the page has no this option.
The Chinese service: We are sorry for your loss, and we give you two choices:
1, you return the item and the buyer pays for all shipping costs.
2, If you don't return it, we will refund you 1000 yen.
(I did a calculation, the shoes are over 4000 yen, counting as 200 rmb, pick 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan ▽)
Option 2, I have shoes, I've been paid 2000 yen for them, and I'm losing about 150 rmb. Customers: We have recorded this, we take it seriously, and the next day the mail came back, saying that I do not accept the Chinese customer mediation, and that's it.
I said, the purchase page is about confusing options like 7c, 8, and 9c, and the Chinese customer service assistant said the Japanese code would not have a c like that, like 140, but have you seen other caterpillar pages?
However, the Japanese language is also a very strong and popular language among the younger generations.
Also, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, the smallest size, and what does that mean?
Chinese service: We provide services in Chinese, but we did not know you were returning your item, so we do not reimburse you for the cost.
That logic I don't understand, I am Japanese, I still want to use Chinese suits, the Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese suits, go to Japan as a tourist without that kung fu to make international long-distance, and the question arises, why should one need to go to Amazon to buy Chinese phones abroad, just like the one I'm picking every day.
Did Amazon's Chinese language customer service make it easier for those who went out of business?
Not very happy with this purchase.
This is the second time that I bought baby diapers from Amazon, I bought a box once when baby was 2 months old, I chose the diaper from European imported paper, my first time was a good experience, the baby is using a diaper all night, and indeed we could use a baby nap for 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L diaper, there are 2 packages in a box, after opening it feels that the paper is loose, there is a distinct difference between importing and serving the baby, and after using it, it is good enough, there is no leaking urine and there are no signs of redness.
But after the second pack of diapers, and immediately thereafter, a rash appeared on the inside of the child's thigh and has not yet gone away.
I suspect 2 packs in the same pack of the same quality.
I don't think we should keep buying it!
We want to protect the transport of parcels.
This is the worst package I have ever seen in a long time, with no protection whatsoever, no buffering bubble, no packaging buffers, and nothing at all.
It is a deformed box.
And the cartons were wrapped in plastic box, and the cartons were all pressed and deformed.
Hope it's authentic and quality is guaranteed, so don't be afraid to buy something from Amazon.
It is better to pay half the price in India with some kind of security.
And the packaging of products, as I read on this blog, was discussed in 2016, 19 years ago, and it's still the same.
This shows that Amazon doesn't care about the feedback at all, and is far from Japan's JD.com and TCL.
Nice, but a little bit sad
The color of the whole cup is the color that my mother likes, red, and even though I have a baby boy, it's very bright when it's pink and yellow.
I think it is smaller than I thought, but it is meant to be used for carrying out of the house, so it's acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it, after the bottle cap was pushed back the distance between the straw and the cover was too close, the straw was in the vertical position, so the son always had to pull on the bulge on the top of the cap with the drink water in it to see if the spot could be improved.
It seems like the leaning of the straws on the other brands of straw cups makes sense, a thing of the children, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large
I like it lightweight and large, that's two separate compartments, that's a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to put in.
After buying this, he found that there was a similar brand in the US, less than two hundred dollars.
Fake, especially the fake ones
Amazon is selling fake products, and I was one.
The customer said they could not return it because it had been used, and I did not need to know that it was counterfeit.
Because trust, so sad, after all, it's the use of makeup, really go to the real store and buy it, it's a little expensive to recognize it
Because it was an assassination, so don't read the comments, I have submitted this to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration of Industry and Trade (Seni), let's defend it together.
Is that bad?
The fake?
This is a tragedy.
The hair was selected in a careful way with the second piece, but when opened it had a strange smell, thought it was normal, because I had not used this one, then I could not stand it when I applied it to my face, a very rushed odor, impossible to describe, immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt, tears came down, and I immediately took it off to wash my face.
The next day, the unbelievers opened another one of the same kind, but it did not have that bad taste, and is now being prepared.
The memory of the smell of the bad hair in the hair salon.
It is hard to imagine that Amazon's own skin care products will be left behind.
You are a whore.
When you bought it, the campaign website said that the full set of the 99 yuan gift was three-piece, the shipment was received without this gift, the customer called the customer to show them a screenshot of the event, the question is who bought it and saved the screenshot of the web page, you have done your own activities, you also need the customer to help you provide it, the next time you buy, keep an eye on preserving the evidence.
The aftertaste
The first time I buy anything on Amazon, I felt a few things, firstly, I use up the product, the first is really painless, no stimulant taste, in general, it is very good, quietly wait about 8 minutes, it will just fall, just a small amount of sweat and hair on it, you can't see it, so it's generally good, and after it, it should be used again and continue to observe, continue to use it only to know.
I think this is really good anyway.
In fact, the second order from number 27, and the delivery of number 12, took a total of 15 days, or half a month, and Amazon's delivery service is also very good.
Third, don't trust Amazon's Black Friday, order on Friday, it was cheaper for nearly $12 after waiting for 2 days, I made more than 170 (and shipping costs), so there's an event to raise the price.
I had been looking at the price for more than 10 days, and it's been like that, no big fluctuations.
Affordable, Japanese made, with Chinese labels, with pellets, absolutely bought back!
The cream with granules, the freshness is just right, the back teeth smooth, more powerful than some secondhand Oriental, where they say it is imported, but many items are not labeled in Chinese, I do not know where they are being sold in bulk.
So, as long as Amazon has this product, it will never be a second-hand item.
And, I'd like to give some tips, especially the ones that are not written in the Amazon app, but hopefully these things will be improved, and will do better and better!
And in the years of excellence, it has been getting worse and worse, the quality of service has gone down the toilet!
Trash Excel took into account the customer needs and the special delivery time from 19: 00-22: 00 for the next order
Due to the fact that they don't have beds at home, they only get the medication in the evening.
The result was that it was delivered directly at the door at 12 noon, without prior phone notification.
If the delivery time is whatever you want, why do you have to work for a long period of time and allow customers to choose?
If your own logistics doesn't guarantee a service, then don't be an e-commerce business!
Asking an old man with three wounds to get out of bed to open the door and get a package would cost a little change!
There's a contact phone on the order!
No one has called at all, no one has called to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint service on ExcellenceNet is a bunch of aliens pretending to be there, spying on your complaint and then giving you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
I'd had the same problem before, but this time I couldn't take it, it was just too much!
Do you think the reverse cover of the book, which is just a pre-order of a new book, should be printed backwards so that the quality problem becomes obvious, so you can just send it to the customers blindly?
Leave a comment and no one will contact you.
And in the years of excellence, it has been getting worse and worse, the quality of service has gone down the toilet!
No more spending money on excellence.
The picture quality is unacceptable.
As a title of the anthology, the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, printing and printing of the images, some of them are so obscure with mosaic that they are not recognizable.
Even if this is not a professional map, even if it is a small illustration, it should be the source of the vast, medieval documents left by our ancestors!
What is the difference between using these images to compose a book and not using them (and many of the pictures are clear, raw files from related industry resources)?
I feel sorry for this kind of governance.
The text is not judged, but it is the choice of the family.
Overall 2 stars
The book I read in high school was just a bored-looking book, and I felt that I shouldn't be addicted to it, and after all, the original web content wasn't as attractive to me.
And then... I fell into the pit.
According to this story, the whole book is a more relaxed and enjoyable, the first part of the book, while still in the Internet, was not at all difficult, even when the war between the two communists was fought, because often he was killed by a dog named "Yeshan".
As for the competition, I found something about the change of the times and the alternation of the old and new, but with a bit of bitterness (maybe it's me).
The whole book took me a lot of time to learn, but it just didn't stop.
Full-time portrayal of characters and emotional lines is very surprising, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also will have a profound impact, like the more important character portrayed by Ye Xiao Huang, which has a lot of fans, but the characters not in the writing center, such as Jiang Bo, Chong Jun Hsu, and others are very popular, in an electronic essay to find that no one can find an extremely hateful character, this is a full-time success in character portrayal.
And in emotional terms, there's not a single piece of work, and there's no general network, either beautiful or rotten, all of the people's feelings have one thing in common, that they love to glorify the game, and most of them really want to win.
The small measures, not big plots, and everyone looks so simple and lovely.
This is probably why there are no annoying full-time roles.
The full-time IP is quite large, thanks to this.
And the book, which is not yet out of print, is a cultural phenomenon, but it is a good book.
I think he's going to be able to offer you some warmth, a little bit of emotion".
An anime will be released in April this year.
I've actually wanted to buy this book for a long time, and I don't have the time for my money to buy it, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found that it was a fake, in fact, another version was recently released, and I'm very fond of the cover art, but I was going to buy the old version first, so I looked it up on Amazon, and I bought a set of it.
The next step is just to talk about the status of the goods.
● The fourth book has no plastic cover but the book is new.
● The 17th plastic book was but opened and the texture of the book was also strange, there was no other hardness.
• The 23rd is the same as the 17th, only harder, but much older than the 17th.
● The publishers of each of the books are different, as if 23 and 17 were the same publisher and different from the other books
● Overall, it was satisfactory, 24 is a big box, very satisfactory.
The young lion with the cubs
When they got the book, they thought it would be as simple as the lost horn of our mother, but it turned out to be a lot of words!
The next day, he read the book three times and then he gave the book to the children, a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that likes to eat juice and sugar.
To see the lion eating the hunter, it is somewhat uncomfortable, and modern urban people find it a bit unacceptable that an animal should be eaten.
Finally, this little lion, who was successful in human society, lost himself; he was no longer a full lion nor a full man.
In the end, only the back of the little lion knows where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of the little lion will live on in the memory of young children who have grown up and remember it at a later date. It may have touched or inspired her.
A collection of works with a high price tag
I didn't know about Taschen before and bought a lot of their books recently because they were very hard, both in terms of the subject matter and the production itself.
There have been three previous editions of this work: the largest, like the whole of Michelangelo, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this is the smallest, with a bookcase and in a two-volume edition.
In the first place, the book is inexpensive; it is more than 700 pages, and it is even better in book form to have a double printing; the second is that in contrast to Michelangelo's whole work, in which the painting is the main subject, the Da Vinci manuscript is mostly in black and white, which is best value for money for the non-artistic reader to appreciate both the painting and the manuscript.
2. The description of the painting part is great, there are structural analysis, analysis of the drafts and historical background (e.g., Last Supper), but I don't know if it's printing or book size, some shade parts of the county are too deep, not see details, a little unfortunately.
And third, the Da Vinci code is much richer than the manuscripts of Michelangelo.
The former is already a genius, the latter is too ambitious and high in achievement to be described as such.
When you see a drawing and only half of a da Vinci, the manuscript has no language at all.
Trash, who bought who regrets!
I never said anything against him, this honest piece of trash, bought a waste of money, a horse, give me a reason!
The time is off and all of a sudden it is January 1, and time goes back to zero.
2. poor quality belt, no rubber, with a rash on wrist.
3. frequently unable to answer the phone.
4. The flight lasted only five days.
5. Sleep test does not show, time is 0 ◦
6. It is waterproof.
7. Other
Logistics are too slow.
It's very sad when we see the results of the 16th of October, only on the 21st of October.
The delivery is not very good, shopping on Amazon is slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfaction
In the first place I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time, it's okay, it has an inflation bag, camera 3x is same, and it can be registered on the official website, the shutter speed is 0, the rest can be just wait for time to check.
The delivery speed is quite fast, the delivery guy is here, the valuable items are put in the doorway, go fast, I couldn't open the box in front of him and check it, and there's nothing to say about this.
The merchants thought for the customer before shipping:)
A professional of the business is responsible enough to call for the screen size of the camera and actually think for the customer.
The delivery is fast.
The use of the gold foil is also convenient and practical.
Battery failure
The machine is really nice, I wonder why the first charge is so full, the charge indicator is red all the time
At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel available, so you can only find feedback through our product reviews.
1. purchased the book for RM31 on March 29, showing that it would be shipped to your device on March 31, but it is not available for preview yet on the Amazon website (because it is yet to be released);
2. The book on your device, launched on March 31, is blank, you just have to wait for it, and Amazon reduced the price of the e-book to US $ 18;
3. For two days repeated attempts to delete the blank book downloaded on the device, and synchronise the file, failed to achieve the essence of the commercial e-book containing the actual content, but the pre-release of the book was found on the Amazon website.
So, I have a few thoughts.
1. The price is not the most important thing, the key is now how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with real content, instead of downloading them forever.
2. books that are pre-ordered should not be bought anymore, as it looks quite complicated to download a blank book after a ticket,
(For the job description and the online customer service, see how the Microsoft Store does it.) 3 I hope that Amazon has provided a normal channel for feedback on these issues, and a place to give feedback when e-books are downloaded or used in a questionable manner.
Not recommended reading
Read it a long time ago, just happened to see it by memory, and then it got kind of dark when I read it.
More than a collection of short stories, the book is a collection of fragments about love in a lifetime.
The tone of the book is flat, as plain as white water, the syntax pursued to an extreme, and the plot is quiet and plain as a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a moment from an ordinary life, without beginning or end.
What are we talking about when we talk about love?
I think the novella, as well as the title, is a kind of acting art, the author wants to convey that love is more than just the parting on stage and the sea of urban legends, not only that the love of me is like paint, love is not only above and should not be represented above, love is also life is bland like water, dull tasteless day after day, there are also the speechlessness of life, the escape from reality, the restlessness of the future.
When you read this book, you may think of the couples that are arguing around you, the broken marriage of the people you know and the bad feelings.
This is why I don't recommend reading, it's not very tasteful from an aesthetic point of view, neither the writing nor the story, and unless your life is as surprising or as sweet as living in a candy castle, the feel of the book will be strange and boring.
And in terms of depth of thought, the daily episodes don't illuminate or expand a person's thoughts or perspective (as opposed to Marx's cholera-ridden love triangle), and the short clips do not explore any issues such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?
Are these the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?
I don't recommend this book, because it doesn't matter if you read it or not.
The idea is that the author's ideas are expressed through technique and style rather than the story, which is the reason for this poor reading experience.
This is a good read, but you can't look at it too closely.
The book is very logical, but not rich enough.
A lot of the theories were explaining what sales is and why, but weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction and not the specific approach.
Also, the book feels like a puzzle.
Examples are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs and salesmen, and famous and not well-known people.
It is not known whether the story was intended as an example, it would be more convincing if some of the cases experienced by the author were cited.
The name of the client varies.
The title is still "customer", but in the main text the text has changed to "client".
There are also problems with misspellings, missing punctuation and incorrect numbering.
Anyway, this book is a good introduction to the theory, but not very suitable for people already in sales work who are looking to improve their sales.
A quick guide to understanding Internet finance
The book is very shallow, just a primer that helps you quickly get an overview of the internet finance, but you have to go deeper or you need to dig deeper yourself.
And, in the early days of the book, Alipay and WeChat hadn't mentioned that they had borrowed a subsidy to cultivate the habit of using the Great War, but the share of third-party payments today was so small that it's not mentioned in the book.
This is the time when many people go out to eat with their mobile phones, and businesses have abandoned the bank, because the cashflow is too high.
But still, thank you so much for writing this introductory book, which shows that the author has at least years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so that he can write this general understanding.
It is easy to write big and tall, difficult to write in the common language.
I admire you, and want you to know!
The first thing that determines a person's job satisfaction is not whether the salary is high or low, but whether the job is valued and appreciated enough.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent is the satisfaction of the psychological needs: the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
For many of our countrymen, it is difficult to express that they love you, even with love, gratitude and appreciation, but they do not express it silently.
In the book, the author articulates the five languages of appreciation: positive words, thoughtful moments, acts of service, appreciative gifts, and physical touch.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them whenever and wherever, to appreciate, to thank and thank those around you, whether family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the more we need appreciation and gratitude from people who are close to us, the better our lives will become.
They learn to appreciate, and to some extent they can retain talent and reduce the number of dismissals.
Thank you translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.
There is more or less a difference between languages due to the cultural background in the Middle and West and more will be harvested, if the chance to see the original text of the author is believed.
Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
Amazon to investigate suspected counterfeit goods
quality super poor, packaging loose, no amount, even worse than roadside stalls products, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, is completely not a qualified product characteristics; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for refund; totally belong to the quality issues; Advise merchants to wipe eyes, reject substandard goods; Add: bought a heart seal, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volume, added several contrast photos, further confirm the quality of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further dissatisfaction!
Once again, I expect Amazon to be careful about sourcing its products.
The product of Ma Ma and Ma Huang has some discrepancy with the expectations
The advantages:
1. Big brands and cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are Panasonic certified, and are OK to use, but not quite as expected.
Disadvantages:
Charging without a tell-tale sign, the most basic of your power instructions is omitted, the customer who purchased the estimated 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, is also generous, without respect.
A very strong smell When charging, even if it is for 10 minutes, you can smell the smell of burning plastic.
We tried it in the office for a day, and it smelled like plastic all over the house.
This is a bit more expensive than the Philips Philips I used before, but the quality is good and it's a great compliment to the customer.
Small packages
If I get the express delivery and see the e-commerce version, I will know that it is falling in the hole. It's smaller than the one bought at the supermarket, it should be M, and the packaging is not the same as the picture on the presentation of the merchandise. It's called the new version.
3 Stars for the fact that Maharashtra did not read the product specification, and you sold the M-code eCommerce version I have no objection, what do you mean by your version is not correct?
The e-commerce system is deep and there is still time to go to the supermarket to buy it.
It's about the violet.
I don't like the taste.
Children do not like the smell of toothpaste and say "mop" every time, but maybe there is another term for it, and it is the only word in the children's vocabulary at this point in time.
I bought it during the events, it is really cheap, so it was a shame to give it a bad rating, 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine and packaged.
The packaging is complete with a blowable bag, and there are no online reviews as of yet, but the product is still showing.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outside of the bottle as shown in the picture, the delivery is quick, the bottle came the next day.
This is the original, only it is out of stock and I don't know when it will be available again.
One bad shopping experience
The check in the time of black five, the result was not received, after a long time, the parcel was already cleared, asked the colleagues around the saying that there was no help in taking, rush to contact the courier company, but said that the sender could initiate an inquiry, contact Amazon customer service, waiting for more than ten days, finally figure out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and then several weeks to finally get back the courier, the outside packaging was unpackaged goods, was intact, and did not know if it had been used, it was bad enough.
The wrong mapping
I thought I could get a headset like Figure 1, but instead I received a headset like Figure 2, even with all the inconsistencies, what is the meaning of the sound varying in size and volume?
Although the names are the same, I hope that you will pay attention, and please have the right layout changed by the person in charge of Amazon in time, thank you very much.
Operating systems in general
For a while, the overall picture is fine, it doesn't make any difference that the system makes people look tangled, the start time is obviously a little slow, it's not able to do a good setting, and the software is not worth commenting on, the response speed is more general, and it's not that much compared to my colleagues
I didn't find that, since the remote control is used to move things around up and down, and the position of the return buttons in the design is very uncomplimentary 。
So let it be a TV, then something like a TV box and so on.
The price drop is too bad.
The price cut is huge, more than a hundred and now 99!
There are a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I use one of the clipped sentences as the rating.
If I use this sentence, I would say that the product had at least 85+ points.
And if the goods are bad I will definitely not steal to copy and paste the reviews so that other consumers can use it as a reference when buying them so that merchants can improve the quality of the goods.
A very cheap line, that's enough without fever!
So cheap line, but it should be the level of the standard of HDMI, personally in contrast to the second kill domestic Autumn leaf originally the motherfuckin joking ((the price is twice as expensive), the line is sturdy, but also soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, low price line approved better!
There's still stuff, but Amazon's after-sales service is so much worse than the other sites.
After placing the order, I discovered an error, but I can't cancel it. The web page has been showing the wrong link, I couldn't be contacted.
When the order arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it anymore and wanted to cancel the order, but the delivery person took it back and said he would sign it for me and have me return it.
You can return a product, you can't call the Amazon customer service, the same is true when you say that the food can't be returned if it's checked in.
I have bought non-refundable items, including milk, paper diapers and so on, and the customer service gave them back, and the customer service of Jindong was just too big, so the customer service gave it back after opening it.
The law is dead, man is alive, how do you deal with your client?
I'll either get it myself, or get a courier to buy it for me, it's not easy, why do I give people money to buy things that I don't buy?
I'm not retiring, I took it myself, but I have to give you a 1 point for your service
We have to make sure that they spend money.
First full of anticipation to buy, felt that the brand should not be bad, where to go, received in the future to see the packaging felt it was fine, but the head is not good, but a box is basically soft, look is not visible, if you feel it, eat it in mouth without any taste, tasteless, bite the meat a round of dark yellow is bad that sort, badly sold, it can eat less than a third of the price, I advise people not to buy, cheap, the quality is too bad!
Eat your heart out and never buy fruit from online stores again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting logo?
From the outside of the packaging bag, the degree to which it is hard to feel is disturbing, after all, the food packaging is too simple, and yet belongs to international purchases, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, opening the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey comes directly from the inside, there is an opening that is almost non-sticky, are foreign products like that?
I don't get it, I was born in China.
It should be authentic, right?
There is also the note for the twenties, when this one is received at 14 and this is the first time that I am buying from abroad, and just to write down my doubts, maybe this is normal?
The delivery service needs to be improved
I bought 5 delivery vouchers in total, when I withdrew, I first requested 3 copies, the first result was only 2 copies, after multiple communication, it was confirmed that it was a missed, I had to make a return; the second booking, just in time for the holiday, website and WeChat had no hint that the booking would be done on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic, I recommend improving later.
Good shopping
Things are good!
It is also convenient to buy things abroad, and the logistics time of buying abroad from abroad to get back and forth from abroad is only a few days longer than in the country. I have to say that the Amazon abroad to get to domestic clearance is still very strong, much faster than to go transport, so many things are now purchased overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of our domestic products is a little bit better, many things are produced in this country, but we have to go outside and buy them, it is cheaper than in the country, hoping for improvements.
Garbage
If you see a package like this, ask the people: Does it look like trash by the side of the road?
Are we responsible for a plastic package, fragile, that was sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag?
I look at these kind of packaging as just like junk; I buy this product and packaging with its simplicity without any measures to prevent damage, I pack it in a simple plastic bag, which is then completely deformed, and the items inside are broken as well.
If I just bump into one of these, I admit, I buy them all and I go to Amazon, and they say they can be returned, but the shipping cost is paid, and the shipping is returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask you, I pay the shipping in cash, you give me the gift card, that means I have to buy your gift card myself, let me put it bluntly, or to mail the product to a warehouse in Germany, but it's not a crime to buy a product!
And I keep telling my customers about who is responsible for such problems, they don't even say half of their responsibility, not even half of their responsibility, what is the guarantee for this after-sales service? One word: yes!
Good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics
1, very good quality, second hand, moderate price, good value
2, the material is solid, the mould is firm, the surface is well treated, the color is good.
3, Logistics is hard, the invoice under the 3, the 11 is in.
4, I might have been pleased if Amazon hadn't marked the expected delivery date as 7 February.
5, but the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving customers a promise, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the customer is very sad.
6, If you are not sure, don't make a promise.
7.In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by businessmen
So, I scored low.
The yellow lines turn.
The effect is there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on personal preference, or the psychological effect.
There's something that is not very good, which is the gold wire, which was designed to look nice, but actually, this gold wire will fade and go to the car, if you move it a few times, on your hands, and on the car, there will be some gold powder.
Hopefully the product can be improved.
This is a square, with no decorative effects, so don't mess up the gold line, fall off and get in the car and mess the car up.
Things are ready, it's going fast, it's packed in two different packages.
8 days speed is pretty fast, but 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, packaging is not the same, obviously one is too seismically, thick cardboard is attached, covered with layers of plastic, the outer packaging is easy to remove, one is similar to the domestic express box, put several buffers airbags, the sense of a bit of overlap.
The Yalan Mattress is genuine.
34 cm mattress is not as thick as usual, but the beds can be used directly.
The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and you'll fall asleep very quickly lying on it.
The bedding had a bit of a dirt on it after the delivery because of the messenger's forceful delivery, and the customer service was very responsible and efficient to sort out the issue.
It's not a self-made product, Amazon is shameless.
The page is clearly indicated as self-serve, the actual delivery is by the supplier, and after the sale is the responsibility of the supplier, if there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself ̳
You want to cancel your order, sorry, the order information has been passed on to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; want to return the goods, successfully requested the return of the goods on Amazon, sorry, no one has paid attention to you, need to contact the supplier for the return yourself.
This is a niche product.
The goods are not distributed by Amazon, after sales Amazon is not responsible, customer service says, "Please help me to contact the supplier, please call us", and claims that they are self-employed, that's too shameless, naked do not show your face, naked to scam consumers!
The experience was debilitating.
The filter works well, after 28 days, one or two days later the water is still free of scale.
Since it's always been the quality of what can be purchased on Amazon, this time I wanted to buy here, for the first time in Amazon to buy a filter, it doesn't feel very good, not only the early start to water scale, and the filter has been used until the 28th day, will be floating a small black carbon powder, don't really know whether to continue to use, or to throw out the direct good, very depressed~
It was not as good as I thought.
Compared with the plug boards I have used in the past, the exterior is generally working, and the interior is not opened, but as described by the shop owner, from the ease of use, it is possible to see if there is a lack of power supply to each separate unit
The packaging was damaged, so it's time to check the quality of the product.
It was badly damaged, the box inside looks new, but the instructions aren't new, it was just updated in September, it's still in stock and hopefully it won't be so bad, please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned damaged packaging and you are safe, thank you!
Overall good, with a few issues.
The first time I bought a water filtration pump, I read a few review articles, felt that LAICA is cheaper than the cost, chose this one, received the package according to the instruction sheet, tried it, feeling good overall, but when pouring the water it looks like the original water from the pump nozzle area will mix with the treated water (the original water tank sealing is not too strict).).
When you apply, wait until all the water is filtered and then pour it out.
The picture is incomplete.
The picture is not a picture of the side details, the side details are not in line with the style of the subject, there is a big difference, this is the first; this bead is made in Thailand, without indication of origin, this is the second; no mark is the texture, this is the third; when I bought in England, each box was marked, here was just a simple plastic bag, and there is no logo, where I can see is a fake.
Be careful what you buy, especially things from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is terrible.
Two days ago I ordered and today I see I have lost $40 for the item, it took me a long time to find it, but the customer said that they couldn't make the price, so they will buy it again and return it.
This customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than some treasures and some toasts.
Still, as a newbie, it is worth it.
I had seen the price in the market before and I have seen that the prices are hundreds, and this is the first time I've played a game of kung fu, and it's okay.
Things are good.
The things were really good, sent to my girlfriend, but a little displeased when I was not in Canada express at noon, the logistics company put them directly in the mailbox and sent me a confirmation message that they hadn't received the item, which made me doubtful.
But baby is really nice.
Worth the Buy
Dear little lamb, Amazon offer is very good, direct delivery to our website, I ordered last night and received it this afternoon, very fast.
The postman is also responsible.
Thank you!
Confession of a customer
1 Amazon customer service advised to not be in a hurry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then somewhere in the middle, you call the customer service representative, and they tell you that this issue will be dealt with by a commissioner, and he will tell you the outcome.
You can never contact the Commissioner, you don't know her work number, you can't contact her direct; that is, you can not contact her, but only she can contact you.
The tragedy is that after waiting almost 3 days, the Commissioner contacted me, my phone went out for a while, I didn't get a call from the Commissioner.
I waited for two hours for the commissioner to call, and during this time, I called Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
4 Almost 3 days later, and I still have no idea what Amazon will do with this second-hand coffee machine that I received!
5 There is no problem with the Amazon of America products, buying abroad is fine, but it is much worse than the services to Asia.
6 As for me, I shall keep on waiting...
The bottom is not flat
Because it was well received, everyone was very hopeful about this soup, and when they got it they liked it, it was very easy, but when it was opened, they found a problem, the bottom of the soup was not flat, the middle stuck out, around the soup went down, the oil ran around, intentionally bought baked fat burst a lot of oil could not cover the central area, the paste, the opening could not be opened, such structure can not cook food properly.
I don't know if it was my luck, but I just picked up a flat tire, and thanks to Amazon's monthly returns service, I've got it back.
I brushed my clothes clean and sober, and went back to work after half a day.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The shape of the cube, with the top of the designers handled as a tiny arc.
It should have been a very smooth line.
However, the end result was not achieved.
This is because the top has two parts, the front is the control panel, and the back is the top of the water tank.
The arch of the top and the arch of the control panel are not consistent, with a height difference of up to about 2 mm after the fitting.
Although it may seem like a small gap.
It was not a great idea, but it would have ruined the whole design concept.
A bit sad for the product designer.
It seems that Miley's product managers do not yet have the ability to create a product of this level.
(To the after-sales lady, the feedback is of course not too high, but when I heard after-sales say that all the individuals of this product are like that, and not only the one I bought that has a problem, her disbelief and honest burden made me understand that the beautiful can not ask for too high) 2019-7-7 the pump failure has less water output, it has been repaired for the second time, two weeks after the first repair broke.
Amazon's fake offer is a sad thing
The baby is a week after birth. The temperature is very good.
The outside of the coating cannot be heated, so it can effectively protect the surface from the heat, regardless of the heat.
The air conditioned rooms can remain at a high temperature even after a night.
Amazon said there were 320 deals in the annual event, and afterwards we learned that there were 249, 289, 299 deals, there was a feeling of being cheated for the moment, but comparing this to the supermarket would still be a lot cheaper than various other brands at the same price, and it'll be available for car trips in future.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300 is a brand name for an
I have been watching for a long time, but I am looking for Melia 6300 and a good deal at the same price in Central Asia and the overseas market.
I ordered on September 2nd, and the expected delivery was on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, which was fast!
The packaging is not big, it is Vitamix original packaging, and Amazon is not afraid of the crash floating in the sea!
The machine looked new, the accessories were complete, the cups were on the base and shook so hard that I was afraid to start the machine and the cups would fly out!
I asked a friend who has 5200 followers to describe how relaxed he felt without me.
The randomly supplied recipe is all in English, and looks boring, I cannot even find the Chinese version online, which is a problem!
When I got it, I bought the transformer, and we estimated that it will be there in three days, so let's have a good breakdown!
It's too small, has no frames, and the material is commonplace.
This is not a big boat!
Two are the Totes, 1. It has no sleeves 2. The handle material is general 3. It's clearly written as Large, which is actually a handy umbrella for one person and is estimated as comfortable enough for two people.
But the one that came to Maya, which can be used by three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel good.
First, the box is not strong enough, it is deformed with a push, and then when the back of the box is flat, the ABS foam prevents the box from blooming and does not work, again, the box inside is wrapped in a piece of cloth, where the lever is highlighted, etc., all sorts of dissatisfactions, and finally the chain does not go smoothly.
PS: The wheel feels really good.
Or you can.
Pros: This shoulder bag is sophisticated and looks durable.
Cons: Can't scan the two-dimensional code on the card ((what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can't be taken down ((going a little longer), the dual shoulder strap is possible to lock it, but without a lock for the buyer, which is not a great service ▽
The whole thing is fine, I don't know if it's leather.
The overall feel is ok, can not evaluate blindly without knowing whether it is leather or not.
A4 size paper may be filled in, and a box that is over 80 pages thick, but is too thick and too hard, which cannot be deformed is estimated not to fit.
The bags are soft, and the spacing in the bags is human, but it's pretty good.
But the bottom of this bag I picked up has a little eye on the bottom, can I tell if my personality is bad?
She had to go back and forth to change her things, but it was not possible.
Overall, four stars, but still worth it.
ForRoyal windscreen worldwide camera strap with single-retro
The design of the strap is scientific, it hangs on the shoulder, is practical, and the camera is fixed and protected on the chest with soft materials, unlike other speed shooters with screws fastened to the bottom of the camera, and it is very convenient to take a photograph.
Waste after sale
The piano I bought a month and a half ago, missing parts, Amazon gave me a call after the sale, after several contacts, the part was still not received, please, what is its efficiency!
I guess if there's a problem, it will be more difficult to repair the car afterwards, so if they're well sold friends, just get off the road, that would be too much trouble!
There was a little glitch, but the sound is good.
The head has a defect, it's missing a horn, it feels like a scrap, and there are no gifts, but the price is fine, and the sound is fine as well.
We're going, the first one.
I tried to use it for a long time, but all sounded good except for the bass.
The other is that the job is not as perfect as he had imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem, all the lights were flashing and could not be used.
They had asked for an exchange, and it turned out that it had been three days since the shipment arrived in Shanghai, but it hasn't arrived yet.
Calls to the delivery service were not answered.
The courier company says they have only that one contact.
Amazon couldn't find a complaint to complain about.
I asked for a delay in delivery, and when the delivery was not requested, the delivery was delayed - the messaging came.
What's next on the transfer question?
Despite the poor shopping experience, we began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I guess we don't get it today either.
The labels are too sticky, not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; And the stickiness of the label is poor, and for cable labels are not at all, very easy to drop, buy to organize cable friends need to be careful.
The pencil is okay, but the packaging is too cheap and it is in a cardboard box, with no protection, and the box for the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent tape, and the pieces are torn off and put on the box.
This is what we got for $600, but this is a disappointing purchase.
The pen is fine.
I hope we can improve the packaging in the future!
The quality of the writing is not as good as 925-25
If you think about the daily delivery of airmail and the service, the service is very fast, the attitude is very good!
I have been working with 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen was said, the style is very beautiful, and the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap regulates the length of the filter core a little fussing, personal opinion: 925-25 is more fluid than 85.
So it became an Amazon death powder.
We're getting the super low price, so our children don't like to read.
When you try to get a refund, the delivery is free of charge.
This is bullshit.
We do not promote returns, but this is the only service of its kind in China.
Hope this is not abused.
After that, the books were moved to this place.
Earphones, and noise.
The headphones are really junk, I don't know if it's my ears or if these are not as good as before.
I bought a blue one at an easy-to-find shop two years ago, sound quality is good, there is no background noise, it's good, and I'm going to buy another one after more than two years (urbeats), it still feels good after all.
And then I see this other purple one, it is really nice, so I bought this one, I only opened one today, but I didn't feel right.
At first I thought it was because of the sound, but after listening for half a day I realized that the problem was very serious, and not only is the distortion, the bass and the sound that I got before that sounded good, there was some noise, is it only the purple that I bought that this phenomenon has?
This is a poor review, and a disappointment.
Be sure to return it in the morning.
PS is good.
This AV booster is complex in setup, rough in appearance and generates a lot of heat.
"Some of the votes will take some time to evaluate!
The DN1080, which was only available in German on August 14, looked pretty good on the surface.
1. The front panel and knob are made of plastic.
The audio input port in the rear, the horn output terminals are very bad, and the 1000-2000 CD power unit is too much better than this one.
3. The top cover is thin, the side of my transformer slipped away, and I had to uncassage and recover it by hand, loosening the top cover from the front panel.
4. The whole machine is oriented towards the transformer end, which is not twisted in moving.
The feeling is that SONY is a machine, just do it, it is made in Malaysia.
I feel it's better for Sony to have it working in China than the little horse.
The machine is heating up, the two-way channel used to watch movies is 40-50 °C for about 2 hours. Touch the top cover with your hand, I don't know if the transformer is too big to generate heat.
The switch power is now used, and this huge transformer is estimated to weigh 4 kg.
Sony should have been using a silent fan inside the machine, and after unpacking, only the large aluminum plate heaters in the pipe.

Never opened.
The battery is dead.
I'd love to dissect it and see what's in it.
Then I remembered, if you take it apart and feel disappointed, it's a big mistake to spend the money; if it's satisfying when you take it off, it's hard to put it back together again, and you're not happy with it.
So it seems, even if Sony had to use a good chip.
As for the details of the electricity, the average person gets confused.
I'm OK, I worked at the phone factory for a long time, besides not knowing anything about the circuit, I'm half a battery engineer, I can handle it.
It was a surprise.
I was really bummed before I bought it, and it felt really good until I opened the box!
When I finally touched the headphone cord it felt extremely soft and the quality was very good and I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone to playqq music.
I was shocked to hear that the sound was surrounded by 3D!
I checked in the physical mailbox, almost 30 or so, but by no means the quality brand is not the same, it is mixed, so I say this win, although 27 dollars, but the price is absolutely worth owning!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28, the system showed that it had already been shipped, but the order was still waiting until October 12.
Check the order status on Amazon.com. The seller did not provide the delivery number, and cannot locate where it is.
So i sent an e-mail to the seller asking for the delivery number, and after two days no answer yet.
I had no choice but to call amazon, the customer service department gave me the seller's number, I called the store and after a couple calls they answered the phone and told me that the delivery was lost and that they would have another one sent back to me right away.
Although I was especially mad, since the computer was very needed, I didn't speak much to the seller, so send it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day and asked if it was shipped yet.
The seller says no, it's going in the afternoon.
So I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said it should come, and at 5:06 pm it came, but then at 7:00 pm when I called no one answered.
The third morning I called again, did I ask for the goods to be sent out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no, he told me I had to order it from another place if I was in a hurry, if possible wait until the afternoon.
I have no way to do that, so I wait a long time to order from someone else.
They just ask the seller to send it fast.
After countless phone calls, I finally received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, as it was bought for someone else, so please add comments later on.
I bought it in a month, but I haven't used it for 6 months, and now the contact is bad, and ask if I could get it fixed?
I think the problem is not that I have a desktop, but that I haven't used it many times since I bought it.
Just a few times in my travel suitcase.
Recently, it was discovered that when connected to a power source, the device did not charge itself, so the charger and the wire are pushed under the connection points with the hands.
I suspect there is something wrong with the interface and I don't know if I can fix it now?
Amazon is strongly recommended to stop EMS!
Commodity five stars, logistics one and an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, which is not trustworthy in the industry, well, good computers are valuable goods too!
The order came in and the delivery was scheduled for the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take 45 days to get from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, Cha Cha Logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready for a party and a reception. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or SMS, Cha Cha Logistics was finally received at noon, and the signage was also displayed.
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
This is why I am so worried about the consequences of my behavior.
In the end, I had to run for a generation to get the computer back.
The reason for that was simply because the delivery boy got the two numbers wrong, as long as the item wasn't lost ≫
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS, I will definitely not buy it again if Amazon sends me with EMS in the future.
Good stuff.
First, just a few days after purchasing, we saw that the price has been reduced, poor reviews, this is still quite good, the price is relatively high, the cpu and graphics card are enough to cope with the mainstream internet games and a considerable part of large single computer, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a little leakage (the epidemic of the screen IPS), the sound quality is not good, the hard drive is not good (recommended to spend a bit of money on adding solid state), yesterday to check the hardware, there is no problem, the win8.1 is not very good, recommend to upgrade to 10, the seller ships quickly, all enquiries are answered very quickly, the next day the ticket received, good, sorry, but there is no gift for the computer.
(By the way, to buy a keyboard sticker do not go to a store called E-cool digital center, the shipment is slow, the quality is poor, the product has problems that cannot be replaced, the boss is full of dirty talk, especially expose it.)
Things are good, the platform bureaucrats are still there
The quality of the hard disk is very good, the price is absolutely high, and it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and it is absolutely recommended to buy if it can be used without any haste and can withstand logistics.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of Amazon is still the same and is unchanged from what it was a few years ago when I swore it was completely useless and you can never see actual logistics, information is always weeks away, you can never complain, and so on.
It's a matter of days to receive the goods, it's still a matter of 10 days to get the logistics information, then you will get the goods!
Logistics are not easy
Not only that the cylinders are open, but the electricity package is open, and I don't know if there has been a re-packaging or not.
FYI
We have not tried it yet, we rely on Philips to have a longer battery life than other brands.
After checking the Internet it could be a waterborne disease and there is no warranty.
The flower!
And now, wrapping it in the preservative, how long will it last?
We bought something that someone had already removed.
It's true that the tax on more than 300 machines is higher, but more than 600 machines is more balanced.
When you receive it, the state of the cap was very wrong, it was as if it had been opened, hurried to take a picture, then it was ripped open, opened and the cardboard inside was damaged, worried that someone else had turned it back on, before the anniversary day, it was rushed to try it on the husband, the machine had no electricity at all, it was better to have no scrap inside the head of the knife, if not a big long-distance backlash!
It is not yet known whether it will be useful or will be any problem in the short term, and like previous reviews, the one sent during the lack of inventory is definitely not reliable!
The higher the level of experience.
This year, it is almost the top electricity, and there are many different brushing modes, but very few people change to a different one daily.
With no wrinkles for six months, daily brushing, and a full day of showering, there were no problems with the skin.
The brush head accessories are also cheap on Amazon.
This app is a little difficult to use, other than changing colors, other seeming compatibility issues are the reason for the overseas version?
They want to learn the law.
The sex ratio is high.
It's been used 3-4 times already.
1, packed.
2. Very easy to use and easy to clean.
3. Do it yourself, and save money.
Overall, a very successful purchase.
Fake goods
Last time I bought two packages, it was actually two different versions, the words on the bottom left of the package were green, but there was one package, it was not, it was white words, and the cat ate the cat and got sick.
I am not sure if it came from Amazon, or if the item was left unwrapped by the staff at the time of delivery.
I am going to buy another one, and if it is fake I will hold you accountable.
It is a lie!
And I have the picture in italics on Amazon, but it was sent to me in horizontal, isn't that a scam?
It works.
The cat likes to eat, that's the point.
And it did work.
Tight, narrow, shaky feet, and back rubs.
Not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable series of Clarke's and this one is too bad
Added: Today compared to previous UN series slippers ((the shoes are thrown away and left to use), the material is much worse than before, it is not as elastic as before, it is not as breathable as before, it is pseudo-soft.
2. My feet are not high, my ankles are about 3 cm forward at the top of the foot.
3. Three pairs of clarks were bought from abroad, only one of them fit
And then I had to delete it from my collection.
Go back and try out Rockport instead of just going to the Echo store.
It is not good.
First of all, it is worth noting that Prime was very strongly attracted by the acquisition of UPS abroad, with the sixth single under the number 31 being received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the skin feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide bars, 7.5 W, and the upper legs are slightly loose, but I usually like to wear them loose, and have a pair of shoes in order.
Secondly, this shoe is a bit of a bad taste control: one toe is broken, the other has scratches, a knob, the toe and the sole have gotten in the wrong place, and everything has been well done.
A little bit of regret!
I bought it for $280, the cost to get it from Arthur was fairly low, and then, of course, I'd read the reviews for a much lower price.
But let's talk about shoes, the advantages: They are light, comfortable to run in, they fit well, they do not loosen.
It is very high quality but also has its obvious flaws: I usually wear 40 shoes and this time I bought 40.5 shoes and they're about a thumb from the front of the shoe, but it doesn't affect anything.
This shoe is very tight and although there is a gap in the front, it feels tight.
Also, the shoes may not breathe well, but now the feet feel hot.
The back foot
First of all, the shoes work well and are well worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk 7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's Lovefoot also bought a few pairs, never had a mismatch, but this pair I refer comments, buy a UK7 number, the upper foot because the size of one yard of length is obviously biased, but because the shoes are too thick, or pressure foot back pressure is severe, plus hiking shoes are very hard, leading to the upper foot is very hard.
It is not recommended if your feet are not particularly thin.
If you have to buy them, you could also change the socks, but the original looks very high quality.
This is the perfect shopping experience!
very satisfied, very interested, Amazon overseas purchase is authentic and no doubt, the quality is very good, the product is cheap, the purchase confidence, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service is very friendly and friendly, handling the problems is patient and efficient, perfect after care is perfect, supporting the express delivery to the door is very convenient and orderly, delivery assistant is very thoughtful about the customer, and every time is reminded to pick up the goods from the express cabinet, thank you to Amazon for offering customers such a comfortable shopping experience.
All in all, we all love to shop overseas on Amazon!
What a bad comment!
This was a pretty bad move for this agency and Amazon.
Be careful with buying electronics on Amazon in the future.
Although it has been a long time ago, I am still coming here to tell you.
In the winter, it is sold in small batches of less than 200, which will keep at home for months.
I found out this was a problem with the bracelet when I went in in the spring, and the instructions for the device said that it was compatible with the other, but later on I found out that the heart rate band is the problem, since the other devices don't seem to be connected.
Call Amazon, they ask me to contact the agency, the agency let me send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the items were sent back as-is, and even the box was the same as the one I had sent!
There was no reply and no reply and no test reports!
Please tell me if this is good or bad!
It would be good to call and ask, and then send it back to say that the device has no problem.
"Why?" the agent replied, "That's none of their business".
Even if I am a loser, I should be hurt by you for a 200 dollar item.
The seriousness of the matter.
This is a very bad product.
The headband is well made.
It's better than Nike.
The air is very good.
Just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Do they make fun of you?
It doesn't completely block the sun.
The return is because it's a good headband.
Wearing it upward does not hide the sun.
This is not the same as the other headbands.
Keep it.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks contract spirit, the delivery is very good.
I asked for the delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon regulations do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
I'm sorry that we had to drive 200 kilometers from the country to pick up my goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give it up!
The good product, just a taste, and good!
But I've never bought anything like this before, and it is not comparable!
Size and logistics
You can still work on it, the logistics are too slow, the shoes used to be DHL, this time Apex is really... I've bought a lot of UA in the country, no prices were low, I felt that it was more advanced than NIKE ADIDAS?
In fact, it's all the same, so there it is.
Size: I'm 176 cm, 68 kg, my shoulder width, the general clothes are 180s, I bought M, the bottom is a little longer, others dress nice, I think there is a recommended S size, the figure is slim? Or do you like tight? I think the hat is loose?
The right size.
Breasts 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, consulting customer service before buying was told to buy XXL, and then read the comments decided to get L, after receiving the goods found that the size was correct, almost got in the pit. ‖
The Double 11 is more expensive than the Black 5.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z Affordable Goods is a problem!
The order under No. 18 was received on the 25th, the speed of the cattle from Guangzhou to Beijing!
It had been a Z Discount, it said it had scratches, but when we received it we found 4 screws and nuts missing!
The child doesn't want to return, not much to worry about, but this little part of an accessory, the child ran to some nearby hardware store and didn't buy it!
The end of the world!
It looks like you won't be able to buy Z's bargains anymore!
The quality of the toys is poor
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the top bolt is difficult, and the quality of the workmanship is not good, and it is not known how long you can play, because it is not the same as what you promised the child.
Other people's reviews were that the device was easy to install, is the only problem that is the one I bought?
Very common
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is old; the work is simple; the music is one, only eight seconds long and then it repeats; the action is just to shake your head and move on without any change.
It's not worth it.
No refunds will be given for urgent use.
The quality of the toys is great, just spit the package
I received it through the mail yesterday, bought it on Amazon with the mark EMS shipping, and then the mail came from Tmall, how many tiles has this changed?
And what about packing, is that it is wrapped with several layers of preservative film, not even a packaging plastic foam paper inside, open a look, all the parts are in the empty boxes, and the quality of the toy is good, no broken parts, is too small than imagined, because not with a battery, the hand pushes off track, feeling that the gaps on both sides of the track are too large, the design is not reasonable.
Quality and fun
It's a lot of fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is very good, the quality is almost Lego, the price is very good.
The assembling process was fun, and my five year old son came along and played with it, and it was fun.
He smiled and said that he would probably continue to buy this brand of toy for years to come.
The machine is new, and the Taipei is very good
I know the previous Christmas the price was about $150, but the delivery is a little slow.
The machine is good, and new.
The built-in pickaxe.
Then the words of the fairy's ball connected will send a dream.
The game is easy to play, more portable than the PS4.
I have already bought the Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Produced bad, sold bad, and the result was the service of bad, bought six watches to send to his children, one of them displayed incomplete numbers, six hours of time were inconsistent, ten hours apart.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if they have check time on the stock? They replied that if the watch has a check time, then the check time is so different, it's definitely the watch that doesn't have accuracy, simply put, it is a sea-going product, not what I said it was not difficult to hear, well, it was obvious quality problems (the numbers were not complete) were sold out, it was not rubbish cargo.
I contacted the sellers and the sellers gave a bunch of reasons, they complained about the things they shouldn't have bought, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who is going to buy on Amazon after all.
Anyway, I would recommend that you do not buy anything from this seller, as this is also junk.
Amazon shipping issues
Upon receipt, the inspection found that:
1. The packaging is badly damaged.
2, there is a serious use of the table specification
3, the clock does not work, the lamp is not charged or used, the time cannot be adjusted.
4 Please contact Amazon Customer Service for an additional charge for shipping to the U.S.
The reason for the 5.2 points is that the customer service is good.
All I can say is put it together.
The time is not very accurate, being about one second faster every day, and after a few months, it has already become over two minutes faster.
If you have used a piece of western iron before, it feels like it won't last a second more than a year or two.
The multi-year calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is a bit sloppy, basically useless, and occasionally mistakes the time-keeping mode.
Solar sports watches
Pros: No need to worry about battery replacement, world time, multiple batteries and full-time notifications.
Failure: The mirror is easy to scratch and get dirty.
Price to Performance Ratio: The average domestic price is between 220-300 and overseas purchases more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
Satisfied watch
The goods must be authentic, go to the counter to examine the goods, the appearance of the table is beautiful, workmanship is precise, materials are used, plus the importation of mechanical movements, so there is a certain percentage, the three or four hundred so-called mechanical table cannot be compared, this is the true value of the goods.
The time of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within acceptable limits, the package of the watch has a certificate of jewelery, the 12 words on the dial are real diamonds, it is convenient to wear, and it is very attractive as a gift.
The Bentley table is really good.
One of the worst shopping experiences ever.
After my wife's phone fell off on the night of September 23, I immediately got the heart of a Malaysian. Amazon ordered an 8p, available but not self-made, without a premium. Since self-made is not so easy, the system showed that the latest expected collection would be on September 27.
My wife didn't have a mobile phone, so she died, so the next morning she called me at around 6am thinking of a way to fix it, and then I went to Tokyo to see if the 256G could be delivered the same day, but only by ordering another one right away.
The first two posts are about the new ones, and I want to cancel the Amazon order right away.
As the order is made in the middle of the night, it is not possible to receive delivery early in the morning, call the customer service to cancel your order after 7:00 and the customer service response has been canceled. Please wait for SMS notification.
OK, I waited patiently, and at noon, I looked at my handset, and the order was still not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to cancel it, and they said okay.
At 3 pm the order was still there on the mobile, there was no way to contact customer service again and explicitly tell it it was the third time, please cancel the order and inform the seller not to ship!
At my request, customer service contacted the seller and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and should wait until he became familiar and then cancel the order.
But be sure to tell me that the seller knows about it and that the delivery is absolutely not happening.
When I looked at the order again on Monday, it showed it had been shipped and I was speechless.
As it is not possible to contact the seller directly, you can only call customer service again.
The next step was simple: I would say something, and then the customer service would do it.
The order is still in the undelivered status, and is ready to be sent again!
Will Amazon not follow suit?
The seller company has received the money anyway and it is pointless not to follow up.
In summary, it's no big deal to pay in advance, as if this is too much trouble.
It looks great.
I noticed this camera a long time ago but I didn't buy it for other reasons besides the price, so I bought it because of the packaging and the price.
After buying it I had no problem whatsoever with the other problems, it was not connected during the software connection, my house is TP's router, after searching the web I found out that many people have this problem, and after more than two hours, I changed the settings of the router, and finally I used 360 WIFI as a medium to fix it, during which I called the Xiaomi customer service, they did not have any solution to this problem, and let me contact Amazon directly after sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw some comments from users online that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, smaller memory capacity is not recognizable, so I would like everyone's attention to this point.
It feels okay, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain level of heat and it can be hard to accept if you turn it on and on.
All in all, there are many deficiencies of this product, so please be careful when you buy.
The reason I gave 3 stars was that this was bought with the first love of my life, with whom I was in a relationship for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year, until now.
The reason I gave the 3 stars is because it was bought with the first love of my life, and now I don't know how much of it I've used, maybe I'll throw it away!
After nearly 3 years in a relationship, she left me last year, and even now, when I think about her, my heart aches to leave this world, the first woman in my life, who brought me a lifetime of shadow and heartbreak, and I have not been able to get out until now.
When I bought this phone, I thought of how it felt then, that you can still share the pain of the same time, but now it's unbearable, and perhaps that's the way life is, some people don't want to meet for the rest of their lives, and some things they don't want to know for the rest of their lives, but what is the solution?
Every time I see the Samsung phone, I think about her, and that pain fills my body with it. I've never been able to spend over 2 thousand yen on the phone, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate to say goodbye to one person, but one day when she changed her mind, all of her promises vanished.
The national brand
Huawei is a national product.
Low-key bosses and enterprises, who rely on technology and quality to win customers, are very different from the business spirit currently based on advertising to improve visibility!
It is impossible for a company that doesn't have the strength to do this, nor does it dare to do it!
This is why I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for over 6 months and it always felt good, very good.
The reason I didn't give full marks was because of the off-line navigation, and I didn't eventually figure out why, and the rest of the time was fine.
And its online input is good at destination, it has automatically design route after search, it has an automatic offline navigation after leaving the wifi start, and it is practical, without having to run traffic, it speaks directly to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!

The paradox states that there is no additive measure whose value is defined on the surface of the sphere equal to the values on all homogeneous subsets of each other (Houstov also demonstrates that there is no additive measure which can be defined on all subsets). The structure of groups formed by spherical rotation plays a key role - and this statement is not valid in the plane or line segment; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded sets in the Eurasian plane it is possible to define a region such that all homogeneous sets of each other have equal measurements of the phases (this holds true for lengths of the real line); but this has only limited additive, therefore this is not a full-symmetric measure, but it does have the property of adding a quantifier whose value is defined on all homogeneous subsets of each other, so that the Bayes dimension equals that of the phased graph, which represents the same area of the same set of all homogeneous sets that have equal measurements of the phases on two non-equivalent real planes or on the plane (equi-equilibrium).

Sir Raeves, who in 1818, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the British colony of Bencoolen, was convinced that Britain needed to find a strategic position to surpass the dominant Dutch position. A trade line between China and India connected Britain and the trade with China in particular needed a stronghold, and the Netherlands stifled British trade in the region by prohibiting trading in British goods in Dutch controlled ports, especially in Batavia, where the levies were at a rather favourable price. The challenge for Raeves was to create a new port within Dutch strength, but British ports were no longer suitable as trading centres as they were too far away from the Straits of Magellan to support the trade with India, and therefore large ships would have to enter neighbouring Indian waters from then on.

A lawyer can defend anyone, even if the defendant is very guilty and the evidence is solid. All those accused of criminal offences, whether the crime is serious or whether the evidence is firm, also have the right to request the assistance of a lawyer.

Chapter One
Yuyun, as his name implies, is a good man.
The family lives in a northern town without any name, if Beijing intends to build a twenty ring and thirty ring, it can be barely counted as an underground, if all the good people in the world are counting on the sound of the keyboards on his head barely counted as a famous heaven, walks on the street and nobody knows him, on top of a picture of a common man in Tokyo for over twenty years, the aim of life is to be a good person, and besides, there is nothing special about him.
In the cooler northern weather, it is also very emotional to walk in the street with the sun shining on you during the day, so you can see all kinds of vehicles running around in the center of Marlon, but there are not many pedestrians walking outside, and a tall young man in a white T-shirt, gray trousers, a normal look is one of the few.
He felt that students were increasingly unemployable at the beginning of the year, and that he would never have seen this kind of thing in the hands of a single mother who was working outside to turn pages, but anyway, the hard-copy flip was quite fitting.
Yang Yijin looked at the last two job ads in his hand, luckily they were next to each other, and he could quickly work out today's "job" assignment, and one of them was in front of him, which is an advertising company that you cannot see how strong it is from the outside, but the sign at the front door rings: Galactic Media Pancultural Development and Promotion Company, and he must have dropped the money in half a year, he just sprayed the name, the main purpose was not to hire, it is just to see what kind of people would be the company owners who could think up such a magical name.
He walked excitedly for several hundred meters around the barricade of the road, then walked across the big sun and to the door of an advertising firm with the name of Special Ox X, surprised to find that the company has finally closed its doors, the sign still hanging on the door, but the notice of closing the gate was posted on the glass door, the date was two days ago, and the recruiting process in his hand was started four days ago....
By chance, the recruitment startup team of the advertising agency threw the final one in the garbage by the side of the road, Yang Lin looked down at the last one, and after two seconds the team also threw it in the same place, by the way, do you think that two days ago when you selected this thing was not blinded a clerk at the recruitment office of the Yangtze bus company, which required a twenty-five to forty-year-old, who can eat hard work and understand computers, who has work experience is preferred, gender.
He walks to the city center to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising company are, which was busy taking people in just two days before its shutdown.
Young Yin, male sex, loving woman, 25 years old, has no **** likings, good eating not picky, is single, no more than a few friends, he lives alone in an old house left by his parents in the city southern and old city, like most young men, his life goal is to achieve by the age of twenty-five, marry a beautiful sister-in-law, if possible it is best to have a car, parents can not obey, so at least to live well enough to avoid leaving your family, now this series of life goals has completed one-third: he is twenty-five years old.
What a sad story.
He came to the city today looking for a job but actually he had no great need for a job as his personal livelihood: as mentioned earlier, He lived in an old house left by his parents and should be thankful for his family inheritance. The house was a big two-storey old house that had been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For years, the woman has been renting out houses to survive in, but the city of her birth is a bit isolated, so remote even that waiting for the demolition of her old house to come might take decades to plan.
With this steady income, Zhao Ren didn't need to go out looking for work, but after a long time, Zhou Wen felt that he should make a little effort to develop his life path, which was even more important, because Zhao Wen's old house was too remote from civilization to move from the house, and since the last couple of construction workers moved out of their rented apartment, there has been no one to rent their house for the past two and a half months, and looking at the empty two-story apartment building for a few months, Zhao Wen suddenly realized one thing: unless the city planning was inclined towards him, or else, he would be scared to really try to find work.
After three days at home studying urban planning, Yan Lin thought that there would be little chance that his home would become a commercial center overnight, but considering that he is a big boss, he decided to find a job first, at least have an income to sustain his life.
Why would the hard working man, who was also working to pay for his education, not be able to starve himself to death?
However, fate did not change the will of man, his first day outside was basically blind run...and he was only left to run blind.
It was not worth much thinking, and Wen Wen bent over and decided to stop under the trees of the park by the side of the road, and wait for the hottest hour of the day to find a small hotel to fill her stomach, and then take the car back home.
Even with the fast economic development, this place is able to maintain a little bit of quietness and brightness. He found the paper to wipe the bench clean, and then he lay down and covered his face with the paper with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl, thus he rested without caring.
But just as he lay down, the sunlight that had just penetrated through the folded edge of the page had already dimmed, as if someone had come next to him. Yi Jin suddenly revealed his face, shocked to find that the sky was already in the sunset, and a small and thin female figure was standing beside him, which exactly blocked the sunset, because the opposite relationship was not visible.
Are you awake?
The strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position in the reflection was so dark that no one could see her, so she smiled and swerved to the side so that everyone could see her.
This was my first impression of a beautiful girl.
The self-sufficient girl left behind a scarf with short hair, and might very well have liked sports, with her skin light wheat color, she was healthy and full of sunshine, her appearance is attractive, the most noticeable are the large, moving eyes, more alive than any eyes that Yang Yang had ever seen, as if the entire human spirit should come out of these eyes.
And behind her is a large suitcase that looks like a lot of butter.
Looking at the slightly frizzy Yue Yinshuang, a short haired pretty lady emitted a beautiful smile which was unprecedented (although that was a bit inappropriate to say that Yingshuang indeed thought it was a joke), the smile was clean and pure, and now that age is now seems to be rarely seen on the face of a girl of her age, the other person in her suitcase made Yinshuang touch it for half a day, finally reaching for a piece of paper and handing it to Yinshuang: "Low, do you know where this place is?"
It doesn't matter what this girl risked, just look down at the address on the paper.... I am going to my house, but isn't this my house?
Chapter 1
The light of the dawn pierced the dark blue sea, the sky was white, and the fish was white.
In the back of a forest of the Wu Zong Academy, a young man wearing a loose, loose gown, double chin, the tip of his tongue reached his teeth, concentrated his entire strength in both his left and right fists, and pounded at people.
We'd just had a few minutes of fighting, but the fighting was slow. It was a little hard, and the fire had been burning for several minutes.
The boy is named Su Huang, fourteen years old, handsome and handsome, tall and naïve.
A dark hair and light hair, a pair of eyes as stars and as deep as the sky of Venus, showed wisdom that does not fit the age.
And after three hours, the sun rose.
Su Yuan stopped his punch and looked at the bloody hands and sobbed softly: "I work twice as hard as everyone else, but the results are less than half of the best qualified.
You come to the other world, you don't know if it's good or bad.
Two months ago, Su-Wan was in a plane crash and woke up to find himself in a world called the Moonland.
It's about being a student of a martial arts school on the mainland.
It took him two months to digest the memory of his former host.
The gods of the Moon, the land of the powerful, the weak, and the violent.
The people practiced the martial arts, climbed to the summit of the pyramid, and reached the sacred realm.
The martial art is divided into nine weights, each with three levels: junior, senior, and peak.
After he broke the nine weights of the martial art, he was transformed into a god and became a mythological character, known as the Holy King of the Jedi.
The limits of the human holy king, which is the limit of the martial arts, the limit of the pursuit of billions of mankind.
There are rumors of a human king, a holy man, who can move mountains and fill the sea and move the clouds, and he can do nothing.
A godlike human king, who could change the fortunes of a kingdom for a hundred years, is the general existence of God.
But why is it so difficult to practice it in this world?
Su-Hyun is the top genius of the town of Qingshan, which is under the administration of the Shandong Province. At the age of fourteen years, he was trained to become a top martial arts specialist and became a hundred-year-old genius in the eyes of everyone in Qingshan town.
But only after he was accepted to the Wu Zhong Academy in Xiuwen, above all, did Su Han find that he had been in the bottom of the well.
All the talents of the Wu Zong Academy, Sendai County, were collected once a year.
And he, of all the geniuses of the martial arts academy, is just a puppet!
Wu Zong University, according to qualifications, divides the students into three categories.
The golden student, a genius at the highest level, often the best in the city, represents the top genius of the rest of the city and is primarily trained by the Wu Zong Academy
Silver students, talented at the level of potential, in a small town, there is a high-level talent, with a little effort, maybe there is hope.
Su-hwan, the Silver Master, was well aware that, in fact, a Silver Master is a class of people who have no hope of cultivation until adulthood, but who renounce and are pitiful, eat tastelessly, and are pitiful, like a rib.
The silver students are not well regarded, the resources for their studies are very limited, and the chances are close to zero.
Yang Soo-hwan, hurry back to the university, the Prince of Qi is calling you! An urgent noise, cutting through the silence of the mountain forest, a middle-aged man in a blue robe gasping for breath ran up the mountain with a few drops of anxiety on his face.
How can you be lazy, Prince of Yang? Come with me! In his years of blue, he has no patience, he holds Su Feng shoulders, does not mind Su Feng's aching body, and catches him fast down the mountain.
Su-hwan bites his teeth, bears the pain in his shoulder, and remains silent.
In the middle years of this school, he was the dean of the faculty, the one who manages the daily activities of the school, in the words of the Earth School, the one who teaches.
After half a cup of tea.
The campus, a luxurious and elegant living room, is a dream.
Only the core members, senior members of the academy, and dignitaries are allowed to rest here; in addition, the Golden and Silver members are not allowed.
Su Yuan came to the luxury lounge for the first time; the ordinary poor kid would be nervous. However, Su Yuan, who previously was the business elite, five-star hotels, presidential suites and luxury balls, is a regular guest, calm and not humiliated.
There were three people in the lounge, a pair of young men and women, and a man of great dignity and character.
When she looked at the 14-year-old girl, Sue Huen stopped for a moment.
She was as fair as a fairy, as delicate as a carver's jewel; her skin as white as snow in spring, her figure as a beautified woman in an immaculate white dress, as beautiful as a fox-fairy.
However, she looked at Su Jun's eyes, cold, but also a bit complex.
And beside him was a young man of sixteen years old, handsome, and noble, and mighty in beauty.
Oh, I am Prince of Xian, and it is a pleasure to meet you. Prince of Xian, one of the three great princes of the Zhao Dynasty, at this time, without any arrogance, but rather extremely friendly, smiled and asked Su Han to sit down.
She shook her head coldly, not at all in sympathy.
The people in high positions are surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people who pay a lot of attention to their health and their image.
Like any political figure on earth, Ming Ming was given water and fire, but after meeting, he was still shaking hands, full of smiles, only a knife under the table, his black hand was down.
I am your son's father, now it's your turn to come for him and his son. Your handsome face, your appearances and your smiling, funny things I heard your son speak, I am sorry for this, as your father.
Su Huang's heart is bitter and his soul is bitter. The girl, named Song Shih-san, is a genius who came out of Xian Town together with Su Huang, and was at the same time enrolled as a student at the Wu Zong Academy.
Two blue and red bamboo horses, two little girls, golden girls, a pair of natural landscapes.
But, after entering the Wu Zhong Academy, Xu Shaizhi from the small village town was shocked by the huge and bustling world, gradually getting lost in the world of luxury.
With her fairy beauty, she could not avoid being sought after by the noble and the noble youth of her day.
At first, she was able to convince herself to pursue her dreams and spend the first year with the girl.
But, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, from a naive little girl, gradually degenerated, knew that it would be difficult after Suwon's death to have a future, and following her, it is likely to suffer and become a failure.
Finally, her inner defenses are loose.
Two months ago, she completely broke off from Su Huan and became the partner of the Prince of Huai, who is the son of the Prince of Huai.
Although she's a girl, she's never had a sexual relationship with a man, but since then, the two of them have often accompanied each other and become god-like lovers in everybody's eyes.
Su-Hwan, however, became the laughing stock of the martial arts academy.
The Emperor was severely beaten, and repeatedly asked Shu to change his mind, even though he begged on his knees and lost face, but Shu was rejected by Shu.
The spirit of Suyuan, unable to bear the grief of his life, threw himself into the lake, and it happened that Suyuan, the plane crashed on Earth, the soul passed through this sad and poor weak person.
Wu Zetian saw Su Han falling into memory, only when he could not compensate for his love for Shih Xiao, whimpering: "Shui young and stupid, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what do you want, despite the fact, but, as a father, I hope you will be a full child, he is serious about Shih Xiao girl. "
Hearing the words of the Qiu Zhuang Duke, which seemed to come from his lungs, Su Xuan shook his head in his mind; this trick, deceiving and deceiving the common man, does not help him.
Who took my girlfriend and made me perfect? Where's the apology, I'm not sure, but it's oppressed!
While the President of the Republic of China is apparently mild, he is full of naked insults.
If the wife of a king, the wife of an emperor, were viewed by his son, the prince of the state, would he dare to let the king give his own wife to her? He would not dare, because he couldn't bother the king, he could only bother commoners such as Su Suyun.
Su-hwan shake his head, wanting to get up and leave, with no intention of falling in love with a realistic girl like Yang She-hsien, even if the emperor of Yan does not coerce anyone, he does not intend to compete for her.
As for the compensation that the Duke of Jiangsu claimed, although Su-Huan lacked the resources to cultivate, although he was a poor boy, although he had nothing. However, he had the will to lose, but was not on the verge of giving up.
Liu Xiaoyang understands Liu Su Fuzeng character, and is determined to lose, when he wants to leave, only when he still refuses to give up, the silver teeth bit lightly, the lions move slowly, the snow is as cold as the moon: Zhu Zuofu! please respect my choice!
Now that you have reached today, I will say things completely, and I hope that you will die. You are not cold in the brightness of your eyes.
Your Highness is the prince of a small country, and in the future will be the anchor of an Empire. He can give me glory and riches, did you give me a poor kid from a mountain village?
Can the golden student, the future saint, the King of mankind, who stands above a million people, give me a sense of security, can you give me a silver student?
Jiao Su Huan, accept the fact, I do not deny that you were my beloved, the brightest genius in my heart, but that was too young for me, too simple, the real world, cruel and true, I had no choice.
Yang Shih Xiao tied up the last piece of yarn and stared at Su Han's eyes, gradually distant as if looking at a stranger, and sigh: "Young brother is very good, as long as you promise never to look for me again, he will try to compensate you, give you a few spiritual medallions, promote improvement, you have improved, you will have a lot of better days in school".
The statue of a woman in crystal is about the size of a palm, carved from a sleeve.
The most beautiful is the woman in the crystal statue, the shadow of beauty, as beautiful as a fox fairy, as beautiful as the swan, so obsessive.
The statue was like a woman, in the shape of a life form, and like its owner, the Sni-san, in the form of a man.
This is a gift you gave me, now you give it back to you, we owe to each other.      Shou Sunshine, ruthlessly put the statue in his hands, turning back to his mother's side, looking out into the sky, no longer looking at Su Hen, cold and desperate.‬
Why do you want to kill me, you pool of water?
Zhang Xiaochun shouted, wanted to get ahead, and squeezed the mattress made of platinum, and suddenly sat up.
The discovery was only a dream, Zhang Xiaodong took a deep breath, and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his sleeve.
We are not.
It was not a dream!
How could what happened to him and the Princess of the Pond have been a dream?
Zhang Zhou, the only son of Emperor Huangming (one of the Nine Great Emperors), at the age of 16, was trained to the heavens with the opposite body type.
However, as he was becoming the first of the younger generation of kung-fu players, he died at the hands of his fiancée, Princess Yuki, who was riding his horse, Qingmei.
She is the daughter of Emperor Xiaoming, one of the Nine Great Emperors.
The Ming and Qing emperors had the best relationship. Zhang Zhaoqi and the Pochuo Princess had been married, grew up together, and trained together since childhood.
A beautiful and handsome girl with the grace of a golden girl could have been a great story in the world of cultivation. Zhang Juzhi didn't know that the Pond Princess would fight against him!
After death at the hands of the Princess of the Pond, when Zhang Xiaochun wakes up again, he finds himself eight hundred years later.
Once the Princess of Fujian, she pacified the Nine Kingdoms, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the Empress of Fujian, the ruler of the whole Kunlun realm.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors of the Qin Dynasty were all but lost, lost in the river of history.
The Nine Kings are dead and the Queen is in power.
In this age, there is but one Empress, the queen of the swamps, who rules the sky and the sky.
Why would she kill me?
How could her heart be so dull, or said that women's hearts are so dull? Zhang Yuen's eyes were sharp, his heart was like iron, full of doubts. However, but no one can answer it for him.
Eight hundred years have passed, the sea is sandy and the things are not human, except the queen of the pond, which has been rebuilt for eternity, the youth is still alive and never dies.
The former dead have all been reduced to yellow earth, turned into white bones. Even the nine emperors of that year were all extinct, leaving only a few mysteries that will be passed on to posterity.
Whoa!
A weak-skinned woman in a courtly beauty, came in from outside the door, and sitting on the bed was staring at the dust, with concerned eyes, "Dust, did you have nightmares again?"
This beautiful woman in front is the queen of the King of Yun Wu County and the daughter of Zhang Xiao-chun, the Empress Lin.
The first owner of this body, because he was too sick, fell ill and died in his bed three days ago.
Zhang Zhaoxiang revived after being killed by the Princess of the Pond, and appeared in this body, bringing the ill, dead young man back to life.
More coincidentally, the original owner of this body was also named Zhang Zhaoqi. Zhang Zhaoqi had just woken up and was very dislikeable towards Lin Yiwu.
After all, in Zhang Xiuqi's eyes, Princess Lin is just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Xiuqi gradually discovered that Princess Lin really cared about him very much, almost without fail, seeing Zhang Xiuqi have nightmares was frightened, even more so despite the frosty weather, and immediately rushed to Zhang Xiuqi's room.
Zhang Zhaoxiu never met his birth mother. It is said that she died at birth!
After being killed by the Princess of the Pond, he would be reborn in this body, but then he would have another daughter, and would feel the warmth of his mother's love. Maybe she did not know that her own son had died of an illness three days before!
If we told her the truth, she might not have been able to take the debilitating blow.
Zhang Xiao-Tung looked at the beautiful woman before his eyes, his eyes became soft, and smiled slightly: "Honey, don't worry about me, it's just a dream.
The Princess Lin wearing a thin, scarlet headdress, sat on the bed by Zhang Xiaoxiu's bed, touched Zhang Xiaoxiu's forehead, worried that: "It has been three nights, and you are always scared by nightmares, every time calling the name of Liang's pond". Who is she?
Naturally, Princess Lin would not have associated the name Chiang Kai-shek with the empress of the First Central Empire.
What's more, the Queen of Qiao united the Kunming community, after the establishment of the First Central Empire, she was known as the Empress of Qi Dawei and Dawei, but no one dared to call her Qi.
Zhang Xiaoxiang: There's nothing wrong, my dear, you heard wrong!
Lady Lin sighed in a voice, he said: "Do not ever again say two words directly to Princess Pui-yang in the future, not even in your dreams, but it's the name of the Empress". If you say the Queen name directly, you will be executed.
Then Zhang Juo nodded, squeezed his fingers tightly, and said with a deep thought: "Oh no!
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
Princess Lin looked at the thin and pale Zhang, sighed slightly. Her heart was very bitter.
Although he was born in the royal court, he has suffered from ill health from childhood. He is sixteen years old, and has been confined to bed for many years, and is afraid that he will only be like this for the rest of his life.
Outside, there was the sound of a stampede of feet.
What are you doing?
A beautiful maiden, who was trying to stop the eight princes, fell to more than ten meters away from the eight princes. The eight prince was a martial artist, trained to reach the end of the yellow pole, and one blow was enough to throw a plate of 300 kilograms ten feet away, let alone a maiden weighing 100 kilograms.
One finger shot could have blown her out of the way.
The maid of honor shouted, and fell heavily to the ground, and broke her left arm.
The eighth prince, dressed in a golden robe, with a jade belt around his waist, a strong body, with long arms and a calm walk, entered the Yueyang Palace and coldly stared at the maids, and beat a slave girl who dared to go in the way of the prince, really looking for death.
The eight princes were followed by six guardians in leather armor, who were tall, with tiger-backed belts and apparently were powerful martial monks, who belonged to the guardianship of the royal palace.
After hearing the commotion outside, Princess Lin calmed Zhang Zhaoqi's emotions, closed the door and walked out.
She looked at the eight princes standing outside, and she slightly raised her eyebrows and said, "Tonight, King of the Eight, this is the Palace of Yueyang, even if you are a prince, do not be a mess".
The 8th Prince, Zhang Jie, raised his head and looked at Princess Lin, and said: "The Queen of Liu ordered that the sleeping palace of Princess Lin and her nine brothers be moved to the Zhu Yuanzhang Palace. The future owner of the Yue Yuan Palace is the birth mother of this prince, Princess Wu".
Princess Lin's face changed a little, as she expected this day to come, but had not expected it to come so soon.
The queen laughed bitterly and said, "Is the Queen of the Jungle going to get us and our mother out of the Jungle soon? Okay!"
Your daughter said she wants to stay in the Yuqi Palace tonight. Please, move to the back of the palace now!
The 8th Prince coldly smiled and said: "My sweet princess, there are many poor people in the world, but not everyone is worthy of being poor. If your nine brothers are weak and sick, what are you doing in the world? "
He's your brother!
As Ling was going to say, suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Xuo-cheng's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hands on the door pillar to stare at the eight princes not far away.
"You don't have to beg them, let's move now". He seemed to have a weak body, but had such a determined will.
Why are you in bed, my dust? It's cold outside, so you should stay out. Lady Feng went to support Li Xuejing, fearing that he was getting cold.
The Princess Lin looked at Zhang Zhou-chu's strong eyes, and seemed to be also infected by his emotions, and her eyes were filled with tears.
The Empress Lin and the Sen, supporting Zhang Zuoyu, walked step by step out of the Yuejing Palace, except for the maidservant whose arm was broken by the hand of the Eight Princes.
The other servants did not follow them out of Yue Yang's palace. Everyone could see that the princess and the Nine Princes had completely lost their power, and there was no room for them in the county palace anymore.
Originally the servants of the Emperor, they were now naturally chosen to remain at the Imperial Court, all to please the new master, the 8th prince.
The purple palace, usually where the missing princess lives, is quite isolated, covered with leaves, and seems to have been uninhabited for a long time.
The night was dark, and the wind was cold.
Sitting on the cold soap, Zhang Xiao, skinny and covered with a coat, still felt cold.
This body is too weak to be built up by the strength of the martial arts.
Otherwise, even though I am the son of the king of the county, I would still be a man.
800 years have passed, and Zhang Xiuchi doesn't know where he is going now?
If he is to be resurrected in this body, he must be strong, whether for the future revenge against the Poison Queen or for the one who does nothing to take care of his daughter. The humiliation and cold treatment he suffers today is entirely because he is too weak, unable to resist, unable to control his fate, and even the place he lives in is occupied by others.
To be respected by others, to live in a warm and comfortable environment, one must become a martial artist and prove one's ability.
In the kung fu world, to become a martial artist, you must first open the Fujifilm Zhenghua Markers.
The so-called "Seal of the God of Shōshō" is a title given to humans by the gods to practice martial arts.
Those who have not opened the seal of the Yang di-shan (武神) will never be able to practice the true spirit, and cannot become a strong one between heaven and earth. Zhang Zuo is sixteen years old, and still has not opened the seal of the Yang di-shan.
After the age of sixteen, I missed the best age of my martial arts, and even if I open the Chou Sheng Wu stamp shop, it is not possible to have much of a success.
They are also the sons of the King of the Yue County, so why can eight princes be above anyone? Can you drive Zhang Yao-Dong and Queen Lin out of the Yue-Yong Palace?
That is because, at the age of ten, Prince Otomi opened the Yongshao Sealing School of Martial Arts, and is now a young martial artist of the late period of the Yellow Pocket Zone.
If you let me open the seal of the God of War, then I'll be able to practice the Nine Days of Rage mantra.
With the subtleties of the Yang Ninja Buddhist Zen scripture, even if I have missed the best years of training, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial artist again. The Yang Ninja Buddhist scripture is the supreme treasure of the Ming Buddhist practice.
Tomorrow is the sacrifice, hoping to receive the approval of the gods and to open the seal of the god of war.
Zhang Zhaoqi squeezed his fist, anxious to open the seal of the Emperor Zhou.
After Lady Ling cleaned up the room, she came to my room and put on her bed. So, you get some rest. Tomorrow, you'll have to go to the big sacrifice.
Please rest assured that I will be able to open the seal of the Dragon God tomorrow.
Whoa!
When Lin looked at Zhang Jiaoxi, her heart sank a little.
Chapter One
At the sound of a bell, a stained iron door was opened, an echoing echo echo of the surrounding ancient buildings.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with his head pulled out from the iron gate by two prison guards who pulled the chain on the handcuffs. The young man, whose head was pulled out, was breathless, even with no legs left, and was thin and frail. The damaged clothing with blood on it showed what torture and abuse the young man had been subjected to.
The skinny man was thrown to the ground by two prison guards, raised up some dust, then stopped moving.
Should this child die? "A small fat guard asked a young man who was lying motionless on the ground.
Another prisoner shouted, "You should be dead. Whoever didn't let him know he was alive, was disrespectful to Miss Jane. Well, not only was Ningfu destroyed, but he himself was free, and deserved to live".
"Old man, be careful what you say, we will drag him out and deal with him later". The skinny and chubby jailer promptly admonished her.
At the news of the fat man, another prisoner, named the old man, bent down and pulled the dead man from the ground, ready to drag him away.
At this point, a rather weak voice called from the other side: "Great brothers, I want to take my husband away".
The two guards spoke and they saw a woman standing beside them wearing a coarse linen coat, who was still visible to everyone, even if she had been dressed with coarse linen. The only regret was that her face was already disfigured, it was covered by a little untidy hair which made it impossible to look at her again.
Both the prison guards recognized the woman as one of the only two surviving members of the family.
Ning Guo was the steward of Ning Fu, and the woman was the concubine of Ning Fu and the wife of the slim man, Jinglu, who had just been released from prison.
She escaped from the evil because she stayed in the school of Zhou Xiang and escaped. Of course, this is also because Princess Xiao was not related to the Ning family, and she married to the Ning family because the Ning family and Xiao family were related, and she became a kinswoman with the city of Ning.
Even so, the Empress Xiulian of Ningxia would be welcomed into the court. Wait until Ningxia really is reunited, then let the two become relatives.
Go to, go to, drag her away, let her be dead. And the fat, fat jailer took the money, and with a wave of impatience said:
They were supposed to dispose of bodies in Ning City but didn't expect anyone to come to deal with them, and they offered silver coins - this is a good thing which they won't reject, obviously.
When the princess heard this, she hurried to return Ningxi and quickened her speed, and disappeared from the prison gates.
If Princess Liu Chijiao was not disgraced, then she was also a beautiful embryo. Liu looked behind her, and another guard threw the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
Forget the nonsense, Lady Jin Luo is also a member of the Yuan 2 Star Academy, and it is not our turn to get even more ugly than that. The thin fat warden slapped the man on the shoulder and dragged him back into the iron gate.
When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a pure white wax. The next moment, when he responded, he was carried by a woman. The perfume came from the woman's body.
No, he remembers that after being rejected by Tamura, he was in a bad mood, got lost in the end, went up to the tower alone 。 then was hit by a yellow tornado that crossed the sky and there was no after 。
What! is it that he is not dead?
When he thought of the city, all kinds of information were crammed into his mind, and he was reborn.
He was surprised that his new body was called Ning. He was surprised that his original name was also Ning.
Just because he had a recurring nightmare where he saw himself in a very strange place, locked in a prison and died in tormented form. Even though it was just a dream, the city of Ning has changed its name to the city of Ning.
Without thinking of turning around, he still called Ningyuan, and really was reborn in the environment of his dreams ᄒ
He said he wanted to lift his hand and wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman behind him looked back and said nothing.
I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk. The woman looked back at herself, apologetically.
The Yang family is gone, but you are lucky to be alive.The woman's voice is quiet, it seems that she'd be the same calm attitude even if Ning was really dead.
He was silenced for a minute, he had just organized some of the bits of information. He should now call back to Ning City, he is the only child of the Jiang Guo Ning family.
His parents went to the Mango Sea to search for spirits when his mother was very young, but they never returned. He followed his mother in living in the capital of the State of Tang.
The city of Ning, of course, became the first person of the city of Ning, and the city of Ning has always been the first. All the bad things that Ning did in the city of Chule were borne by Ning. The city of Chule had princely nobles everywhere.
Finally, one day, Ning city had a disagreement that even he could not bear. He was offended by the Ming Pearl in the hands of Jingguo's mother, Jane Sunzo, not to mention Jane's mother was disgusted with Ning, or Jiang Yuwen, who was her fiance and her mother.
Thinking about this, Yinxian sighed. His unpleasant result, of course, was to be sent to prison. Ning Ning tried to protect him, exhausted his contacts and family resources, but was not saved, instead he took the whole family. This information was learned from the mouth of his predecessor from the prison guard, and we can say that the family was also because he was killed.
After having made these things clear, Ningxi sighed in his heart again, this world is without reason, whose fist is bigger, who is the reason.
At the same time he perceived who it was behind him, that the disgraced woman was his betrothed, called Princess Cloe, something like the mother-in-law of the child of the earth.
Later, the family mysteriously fell apart, leaving only one of the disgraced Princess Gillo. However, the Princess Jing of Ningxia still received the Princess Gillo at Ningxia, and after the preparations of Ningxia, helped both of them complete their marriages.
Ning Ning has given her the other things, but he never gave up in taking Jinglo as his wife. The original Ning Ning was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Zhong Luo, often did not dare to speak ill of her, but in the back of Zhong Luo, she would never contradict her. And unlike Zhong Luo, she has qualities that can be modified.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Wei two star academy, and already became a three-tier monk. In the Sui state, only those who can practice are called monks.
By this time, the Queen of Qin had moved him into a very low black stone house. Although low, the black stone house is not very small, at least some should have been there. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well in the yard.
Even if it were about him, Ning should be sure of it. Although he guesses it was the Yan and the Zhu family, he has to ask some questions.
Why do you ask me about what you do?" With a simple answer, she let Ning Ning down.
Then she poured a cup of fresh water over it and said, "Let me boil some water for you to wash yourself. You know it is not good for you".
He saw Jiao-lu going in to boil water, and without asking any more, he understood what she meant. With his power, the more he knew, the faster he died.
It is not known whether Lady Gilou added something to the water, but Ningxiao felt the water and felt rejuvenated after drinking it.
Ningxia sits on an old wooden bench, thinking about the present situation and thinking about his sister Ningjo Lan. At the same time, he didn't understand why Tamura would treat him like that, according to his understanding of Tamura, Tamura is definitely not a selfish girl.
Chapter 1
Chuan went by boat on the lake, and the wind of the lake swept on, refreshing the people.
The palace of the Yue Emperor was a vast lake with ninety-nine islands, and his destination was eighteen kilometers from the Imperial Palace and the Eastern Gardens.
On a small boat, he's of medium height, with a blue shirt, he looks like an ordinary man, but he has an air of heroism, looking at the lake and thinking far away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days!
A high-energy physicist, a bright student, a scientist of the future, a small mistake in the experiment, the explosion later came to this world, reincarnated as a human!
The sound of the whistle interrupted his reflection, and he looked up and saw a golden fish, shining brightly, beating on the boat.
Chu shook his head, bent down and threw the shark back into the lake. He stood up straight, and a tall tower appeared into his eyes.
The building is 100 meters high, brilliant in bronze, heavy and solemn, showing the dignity of the state capital.
This bronze tower is the Palace of Arms!
In front of the temple there was an open martial arts arena, red earth floor, hundreds of people practicing kung fu, or practicing sword practice sword practice hand practice, or interact with each other with great enthusiasm.
Chu approached the shore, entered the martial arts training ground, and after walking a few steps, a handsome young man with a face like a crown, and brow like a sword, was suddenly seen.
He was tall, towering from head to head. He looked at him with shoulders and said, "What are you doing here, Mr. Chu?"
Chu frowned: "Let go of me, you good dog.
Young handsome Yang laughed: It is so hard for you to want to practice martial arts?
Chu suddenly laughed and continued walking forward: "Ding Tzo'er, I fell down and cried, can you not believe that you can't eat and walk? "
They are not allowed to kill each other, the guard is divided into guards and guards, one for a living, both forbidden to fight in private, the light one to give away, and the heavy one to evict from the court.
Chu Chu is the unrewarded waiter, and Chu Feiyuang is the eight guard, and the guard is the guard of the waiter, he fell and shouted, and Chu Feiyuan and other geniuses should also be severely punished.
Zhao Fei raised his sword and said: "The one whose name is Zhu, don't be ashamed of it, let's go.
Chu Feiyan took a step back, with a dark look on his face: You, whose name is Chu, can only use these small means!
"A little strategy is enough to deal with a fool like you!"
Chao Fei stared at him dying, his fist was tightening and tightening, like the next moment, Chu Chu stared at him with a glance, picking up the right flavors.
Choi Fei-yang smiled with a bright smile and waved his hand: "Bonjour!"
In the distance, a beautiful girl came, her skin was white like snow, her eyes were like almond, her temper was sharp and soft as water.
Chu had changed his color in the slightest, had moved into the palace with them, and was beautiful, kind, and gentle, the kind of woman that all men would like to meet.
Jiaochu Brother? Yang Yang came over and said, "Young master Zhu?"
Chui Xue smelled the fragrance and smiled: "Oh master, I haven't seen you for a long time.
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he spent most of the time in the library, wanting to use his knowledge to change his fate.
This time, I came to the temple of Wushu, and encountered problems with the practice of the Shifu. I wanted to look at the secrets and practice notes related to the Shifu.
He laughed: Congratulations, Master Chanchu, the Eastern Garden is beautiful.
Chu Yi nodded with a smile: You're good.
Eastern Garden belongs to the Three Misses' island of Yucun, only he and Li Wei are both serving, not only are they relaxing, but also have the chance to see the Three Misses, once the Three Misses win, the Yellow Jade is available.
Zhuang took a deep breath, he was so lucky that he just got into the garden, and he didn't open his eyes to pick him up!
Teacher-in-law, clear this garbage, I just practiced the method of broken sword yesterday, cut the fist.
Zhao Feyyang grumbled, thinking that he was hard to hear.
Oh, well, well, he's not rubbish is! Oh, Zhao Ziyi was hurrying to laugh, wipe her eyes away: Oh, even though he is a piece of shit!
The dissatisfied, big eyes of the mother.
My sister, it's okay, "Zhou Zhuan smiled and said, "You don't need to compete with that arrogant, arrogant idiot.
This is the way to fight back.
Chu Chui held out a hand and surrendered: Master sister, come and play in the East Garden, the scenery is beautiful, and my brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent
Oh, what do you see! Yang Zhaofeiyan gave up his mouth: You have only flowering plants, there are times when it is better to practice martial arts, games are not humorous! As you say, the three girls and the Prince are the players are not humorous, but you?
Zhao Fei Yang's face turned red, and he laughed and decided not to fight with him.
Brother Zhao! Brother Chu! The unpleasant tone: "Please shut up for a while.... Brother Chu, I'll go play, do your thing first!"
Chu looked at her very deeply: "Sister, someone has grown into a good skin sack and it takes a long time to get to know a person, don't trust others too easily!"
My name is Chu, what do you mean?
Chu ignored him, laughed, and shook his fist.
She turned and walked away.
And Zhuge was hasting to follow, and, when he approached, suddenly stretched out his hand without his mother's knowledge.
He almost had his fists on Chu's face, and he was so confident that he couldn't avoid the fact that he was coming and looking without attention, but he was carrying this inner power and it was very fast.
The wind was moving slightly on one side of his head, his fingers flying over his cheeks, and he could feel the force of a light hand.
Oh, my God!
The sound of a crisp, loud ringing.
Chu clapped his left hand on his face, crisp and loud, with little energy, and loud, then quickly closed his hand.
The old man then quickly turned and looked at Chu without changing, as if his hand had not been on his face.
He looked at him with a gloomy look. He laughed a little and touched his face. "You are a good swordsman, I admire you".
Choi Jian was staring at him dead.
You see the face of the dragon, Master Chen.
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to be rude... Zhou Chao Zhijian gnashed his teeth and his voice came out cold, "I think Master Chu doesn't care, right, Master Chu?"
Chu turned around and laughed: "Master, that's right".
It's uncomfortable to look at him, he hurried to the airport to go away, then stayed, and the two of them couldn't fight.
Chu looked up from Jia's back, touched the left side of her face and started to hold the big mirror to his head.
If it had not been for the large, round mirror, he would have been in great distress.
This world honors Wu, the idea deeply implanted in his heart, from a young age, he has been gentle and kind, knowingly and secretly protecting himself, making him excited. △
But as a man, he needs women to take care of him, and as a man, he can't stand it!
He passed through the crowd on the martial field and entered the temple of the martial arts.
He took off the wooden table from his waist, and handed it to the boy before the temple, whose eyes were like lights, and he wiped his eyes, to show him he could enter.
In his eyes was a row of shelves, which he passed slowly, stopped occasionally, reached for a book, quickly turned it over, returned it and continued walking, stopped again, and picked the book up again.
At one point, he turned over 22 books.
He looked at his books as if he knew where they were, and he just took them out of the box. In fact, this was the first time he had ever been in the library.
The whole of the theatre was present in his mind, the name of each book, each shelf, the names of every book, in clear chronological order.
He walked to the second floor, went directly to the third floor bookshelf, and pulled out the book of the Cursed Sword in the second floor, turned it over once more, and then pulled out the seven secrets, the practice of the Cursed Sword.
When he left the temple, his brain had been sewn with thirty secrets, twenty-two notes on the practice of the small pulse, a fragment of the broken sword, and seven broken swords of mind.
He sailed on the lake in a little boat, and the wind died down, so that the old fury of the bear was gone.
The 30 secrets of the mind began to merge.
At midday, the burning sun, he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a small square island, divided into a garden, each with a rare flower, and the island is perfumed with flowers.
There was just a small courtyard on the island, and the shade came from the door, and a great tree covered half of the courtyard and expelled the hot air.
He entered the vestry room, and the sword of the frog was brought forth, and waved, slowly like a tai chi sword, in the middle of the court, and for a while a layer of sweat came out, and his brow was bright.
The secrets that he saw and remembered had imprinted on his mind, and the broken sword technique that he had just learned from the martial arts hall was amazingly powerful, but also very exhausting.
Wow... and a young man comes out of the gym with a big face and small eyes.
He trembled like a black bear, stretched his hips, even groaned, and spoke softly, "Brother, did you come back so soon?"
Xu was concentrating on his sword practice, only shouted. Li Wei, a Ninja Swordsman, the two of them are in charge of the East Garden. He has a good mouth, a good stomach, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts, but is afraid to die.
The civil servants and the police were paid ten times less than the regular guards.
Guardsman salary is lower, the class must be graduated, three years nine items, ten years eight items, twenty years seven, forty years six items, seventy years five items. Guard upgrade whether others only see the martial arts, nine classes of buildings, upgraded over the level one.
He has a high salary, and can also be out of the palace often to do duty, living a varied life, not like a waiter who can only stay in the palace to serve others, but anyone who can be a guard.
Lee Waer shook his head, stretched his legs, and made a series of crackles, followed by a fist-whooping, the fist that was like a meteor, who breathed a new leaf.
Don't practice with your sword, brother, practice your fist with me!
Choi spewing two words with a layer of soy sweat on his forehead.
This world is full of martial arts, practiced from a toddler.
After eight to eighteen years, once the pulse is formed, the magical mindset also works harder and harder, it takes several times more time to build the foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he had studied and gained great wisdom from his youth, and had lost touch with the foundations of his religion. He was twice as skillful and strong in spirit than others.
In a previous life, he was a high-energy physicist with an exceptional knowledge of the world.
At the same time, he was able to realize the secret of the great wisdom and attained the Great Mirror of Wisdom.
His mind is strong, his practice is much longer than that of the ordinary, God is in his body and sees everything, so he bathes his pulse very fast, he can build the foundation in five years.
And, if you can't kill a tiger with your sword, what do you learn in the field?
But he suddenly drew his sword and said, "What's that?"
And as he sighed, his body became feeble and weak, and he bent his sword to the ground, and was crushed, and his flesh was sore wearied.
1. Chapter 1
In the old, fragrant, decluttered room, the dawn woke up in the morning.
This is the instinctive response of a good Special Forces soldier!
As the hand fell, he felt an electrical pain in his hand, and he was helpless.
She opened her eyes.
A soft female voice came to my ears.
Ling Day saw a delicate face that was looking at him with care.
This is a classic beauty, suffocatingly beautiful and can best be described as a Dinka-dinka.
Good afternoon, Chinese people.
He served in the most outstanding Chinese Special Operations unit of the Wolf Fang, during which time he made countless achievements.
He has participated in the world-class Special Forces competition, won the first individual honors for single soldier combat ability and was recognized as the King of the Mercenaries!
Later, during a transnational SSS mission, a small personal mistake was a factor leading to the death of a fellow soldier.
Under self-censorship, he chose to retire and left the Wolf's Tooth.
After retirement, he went into a quiet period, chose to go abroad and became a member of one of the most prestigious mercenary groups in the world.
As far as his job is concerned, the success rate is 100% unprecedented!
Although he has been retired from the army for many years, he still holds China close to his heart.
As long as the mission is bad for China, not only does he not accept it, but also fires the person who sent it, carrying out a monstrous inhuman slaughter.
With time, he has become a thorn in the side of all other countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a time bomb.
However, as the lives of the killers evaporate one by one, no one ever dares to take on a deadly mission.
To kill in the morning is to kill yourself. This is a phrase that is accepted by the mercenary world, the world of assassins.
He traveled the earth and never encountered any enemy or foe.
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
The R State of Russia is planning to make a colorless, tasteless bio-chemical weapon with the intent to smuggle it into China and to carry out a terrible plot against the country.
Of course, Lin Xian is not going to look the other way.
He did it!
With the help of an agent, the location of the chemical and biological weapons was found.
He had just cut out a road to the underground laboratory where he intended to destroy the biochemical weapons. The lab suddenly collapsed, trapping him in a completely closed cell.
When I saw an R nationals coming out of the prison holding all sorts of guns, it was clear the next day.
Betrayed by the people he trusted the most!
Otherwise, by his cunning, the conspiracy of the people will not work.
He was shot dead by a sniper while walking in the street.
Oh my God, what's wrong with you, don't scare the girl.
The soft voice came, full of anxiety.
He was certain that he did not know the woman.
But the women's eyes now are as if they were looking at their relatives, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
The same thing happened when the day dawned and the theory of the beautiful lady.
She was struck by lightning, and completely silenced, as if in a hole.
The only thing that made Ling Tianyi satisfied is that this guy is also Ling Tianyi, whose full name is Deng Gang Ling Tianyi.
Chang Liang, 15, is a member of the community.
Li is the middle son of the family.
His mother, Li Zhu, was the eldest of the Li family.
His father... in his memory, had no father.
In the process of fusing this unfamiliar memory, Ling Tian also knows the reason why Ling Tian was lying in bed with injuries.
This morning, Li's seven eldest and youngest son, Liu Li, called Geng Liang a wild child who had been born and raised by his sister.
But he, who did not even complete the body of the body, how could he be a rival of Li Yang's body of the body, directly hit by Li Yang's heavy wounds and died.
After fusing all the unfamiliar memories, I sighed in my mind.
He knew that from this moment on, he would be integrated into this strange world as a hero.
From this time on, he is the sun above the earth, the sun above the earth.
Mrs. Yang, the master of the house has asked for medicine.
I felt a voice in my ear, and I looked up at the sky.
One of the ladies rushed in from outside the room and handed the elegant box to Li Ju.
The box was opened.
Come and take some of this medicine, my daughter will cure you.
Li-Ju took out a black incense from the bottle and handed it to Meng Lin-hsin's mouth.
He then took a deep breath, opened his mouth and swallowed the medicine.
The entrance of the dandelion was instantaneous, and as a warmth it entered his body.
The next day, I saw him again.
A cold breath came into his body, and opened the warmth of his medicine, which healed his wounds.
An hour later, Lee was killed.
The next day, she discovered that most of the acidity had disappeared, and she was no more a burden.
Did he just take the stent?
At the time, he was found with a pale face, his forehead still sweating, and it was obvious that he had spent a lot of energy to get treatment for his injury.
Girl, are you okay?
He said, "It is a blessing".
The girl's voice was sweet and pleasant, there was nothing unnatural about it.
She is fine, just take a rest.
Lee Joo smiled and shook his head.
It's not a waste of energy for the sake of my son.
He and the seven elders were still waiting in the prison. About half an hour later, Wang walked back into the room, quietly saying.
Tell him to go to the family, I will take care of it myself.
The harmony of Lee Ju's face was so lovely, so cold and empty.
Girl, what kind of daffodils you just gave me, I feel my wound is almost healed.
She got out of bed and stretched her body out slightly.
That is the 8 gold pieces created by Tang Tang.
As it turned out, even if it was Li's family in Chongqing Town, only two of the eight pieces of gold were made, but now one is being used on his illegitimate son.
It is clear that his daughter is no less important in the Li family.
Oh my God, the owner is still waiting, and we went over.
Li Zhiyu was late, and came to a spacious courtyard of the Li family mansion.
This is where the Li family executed their family law.
It was about noon, and the sun was shining.
People were standing around the prison, all of them children of the enthusiastic Lee family ‖.
In the courtyard, a young boy was tied to a column, and two middle-aged men were standing beside him.
The older man in the cloak on the right sees the two children on the couch with angry faces.
The day of Qinglong came... the eight family treasures of the golden triangle were awesome! Yep yep, I also saw that when Qinglong was taken back, half dead and dead.
Yang Li, normally just to bully some Li, would count, the nine elders would say nothing, but this time he had such a heavy hand, almost killed the Li, so it's strange that the nine elders did not go to their senses.
One of the Li family sons saw Li Ju and Meng Ling day arrive, and steal whispers.
Li Ju, carrying a handkerchief, walked to the middle-aged man on the left.
Mr. Chen, today's matter, my son Li Yi did wrong first, but now that your son is safe, my son is also exposed one morning, can you let him go?
And at the moment, the man in the cloak, the elder of the Li family, Wu Li Zhen, was shy.
Who knows, Lee Joo has never gone with him.
Instead, he brought a briefcase of sand, and went to the bound Li Qiang.
Oh, my God, how he hurt you in the morning, now you give him fifteen tenths of everything!
As she woke up, she was confronted with a very important question. She didn't know that things were changing in her surroundings!
Looking outwards, across a gap in the corridor, there was the moon hanging in the air and the stars in the sky, and she was lying on the ground being carried forward.
She felt some shivers, and could not restrain herself from a movement; but then the more grave question was discovered--and that was that she was naked! All that was in her body was a thin sheet of silk, which covered her from head to foot, with only one eye on the outside.
Her cold eyes were on the two big men who were holding her.
Kung fu is strong, muscular, dressed like an old samurai, although carrying people to the street silently, at first glance it's practicing, kung fu is not inferior to their look.
With her finger trapped in the blanket!
She is the king of the modern killers, cold and cruel, traveling around the world, but does not think that the most trusted man, the man named Longxi, her former teacher and doctor, who does not believe in anyone but him, even liked him, and wanted to marry him.
It seems she was already dead, but instead of going to the King's Palace for tea, she came here.
Of course, she has no idea what base she has reached at this moment.
She's through!
Through this body, it was wrapped like a rope and carried to a magnificent palace.
Ooh... oh.... life... life... oh, oh, don't... the sad cry of the woman's gentle pain is instantly heard, and her thoughts are recalled with regret. Her eyes go rapidly and lightly!
The man above, handsome, twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with long hair and a blue jade veil, had a mess of muscles on his shoulders, strong and vigorous with one-volume movements, the corners of his lips were slanted and with a slight smile of coolness, he was a cool bully.
Below is a very innocent girl, very young, with a clear brow, unlike the expression enjoyed by the man, the little girl is pale in the face, her little mouth is sticking, the neck is crying, she is crying, cold sweat has wet her hair, and she is obviously suffering to the point.
This son of a bitch, who is he?
The two old men went in, carrying the pigeons, and could not disturb the man's spirits: for his movements were more rapid and more violent.
The little girl was at last overcome and cried a few small cries, rolled her eyes, twisted her head, and did not move.
And he shouted with a loud voice, and with a curse, and with a rocking, and came down from her, and cast her down as it were from the waste heap.
The girl didn't move, her face turned yellow, there was a blood line on her lips. She didn't know if she was dead or alive.
Even the man who had bought the poor widow's hay with his own money took it and put it to the dogs. The man's voice was filled with rage and want.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small city in the western United States. It is located in northern Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, and overlooks the famous Grand Canyon to the east, with nearby Phoenix- Las Vegas to the west.
The US, Arizona, the Grand Canyon in Colorado, and Las Vegas are four names many Chinese people have heard of, but there are not many who know about the flagship market surrounded by these four regions.
Half a year ago, Li Du was one of the few, until he came to Flagstaff to study.
Flagstaff is not well known in the country, nor in the US, but there are some good colleges, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American University, etc.
Li Du's high school is called Flagstaff National Academy, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American Academy, and that word is God!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of the American College, a private school that offers undergraduate, graduate, and undergraduate studies.
This is an underground university, where Li Du is a completely ignored graduate student.
As a result, his tuition fees and research funding were not paid for the first half year and the school was seized, the school board and admissions department were notified ahead of time, leaving a group of international students facedown and turned away by the police.
Li Du was lucky, because his school housing was so messy, he did not have a dorm room in order to study, instead he found a room in an apartment that he rented, now there is a nice place to stay. His fellow students who paid for the school's accommodation would be wandering around the street.
But his situation isn't much better than his classmates, and now that his rent has expired at the end of January, if he does not make that rent in time, he might end up on the streets.
The sad thing is that it will cost him money!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and friends in the country, but the prerequisite is that he is studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, his graduate student can't read, where are the old-age parents who will ask for money?
While sitting grimly in the small house door, the pine wooden door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a girl with blonde hair and big eyes looked up and said, "Oh Lee, are you here?"
The house was left to Hannah Fox, his landlady, by her parents, who died in a car accident, and to her and her brother, Hans Fox.
However, Hans said he has some big business to do, and he won't be staying for a few days at the end of the year, so Hanna has taken the empty bedroom for rent and has earned money.
Li Du stood up when she heard the call and said, "Oh, yeah, Hannah, what's wrong?"
The girl's smile swelled, and a pear appeared on her beautiful face: "I was just cleaning out the fridge and saw some beer, it must have been left by Hans". I remember that you like barley beer, so why not finish it?
She was carrying a half dozen six bottles of beer, in the usual wooden packaging with the obvious Beverly Hills LOGO on it.
Li Du smiled at the beers, there was only a small refrigerator in his apartment and he opened it every day, where is the beer?
And with Hans's temper, if there were any beer, he certainly would not stay, for this man is an alcoholic.
He thinks that the beer was bought by Hanna to console him, and is very moved that she had consoled him several times after he had heard that their school had been seized.
But Hannah did little to comfort him by sending him a motivational book or a beer.
This American girl had asked to know about Chinese culture and learned a saying that "drinking and sleeping is the best way to overcome anxiety". She thought that according to the Chinese, drink alcohol to sleep can alleviate anxiety, so she sent him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness, and was obliged to her. In American society, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise it would be mistaken as refusing friendship, and he cherished his friendship with Hannah.
When he received the box Hannah walked away with a smile, and before she left, she said, "My life is full of problems, but it's wonderful".
After repeating this American proverb, Li Du opened the packet to get a beer. But when he opened the wooden box, a piece of amber-like crystals suddenly fell out, and the bar bar collapsed to the ground.
The crystal, about the size of his thumb, fell heavily on the concrete floor and appeared in several cracks.
We guess it was amber because it was pale yellow, wrapped in a worm, like one he had seen in the sixth grade. At that time, there was a classbook called amber, and when they had language lessons, their teacher brought a piece of amber with them.
The crystal reminds him of some of his childhood moments, and he remembers the time his teacher said that amber with worms was precious. Unfortunately, it had broken, which made him very sad that otherwise it would not be able to pay for two months.
The crystal had fallen so badly that when he picked it up it had shattered and the little purple worms wrapped in it came out.
The shape is similar to a caterpillar, about two centimeters long, odd in shape, with a caterpillarlike eyes, but only two legs under the belly, weird lines on the legs, no wings on the back, and looks very clumsy.
Li Du, who had never seen this insect before, awkwardly stood up to see for himself.
It was then that the curious thing happened: the claw of the caterpillar suddenly moved, then quickly regained its strength and twisted its body out from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the worm leapt into his palm, his head was down, and slowly, little by little it penetrated into his hand!
Li Du was scared to pee, really did!
I yelled and he ran into the room, trampling, and shouted, "Donna, call 911! Help me, I have a bug in my hand".
It seems that the crying was too loud, and Hannah came out, looking terrified, "What is this, a bug?"
Li Du held out her hand and said, "This is my cat, this is my pet bug.
Hannah was startled, "You have the bugs in your hand? Where are the bugs in your hand?
Not only does the insect have its own movements, but it seems not to be lonely after it has penetrated Li Du's palm, it bursts out again, and half of its body is bursting out.
Li Du pointed to the bug that was coming out and said in shock: "This one, this one, purple worm, can't you see it?"
Li Du interrupted her, shouting, "Hannah, I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy! I'm not crazy, Hannah!
Yo Chet, the bug is out again!
And he cried aloud, and it came to pass that the worm pierced his skin, and leaped to the ground, and took hold of his two feet, and walked upon the ground as a man does.
By the way, there was a drain next to the spot where it landed, so the worm didn't notice it and went right on by it.
When he saw this, Li Du Du Qi said, "It is so good that the insects have fallen into the drain".
Subconsciously, he came up with a thought, what's in the drain, could there be sewage that could drown this bug?
But then something incredible happened to him!
Chapter One
Shinjuku, the northern desert.
The ice and snow swept the whole land, and the mountains and valleys were covered with silver, and the snow was heavy and soft; and the distant skies and skies looked like gold.
On the road to the mountains, a caravan of merchants was resting and the snow was too much, the carriages had difficulty traveling and had to wait for the snow to recede to get on the road.
Look, coffin snatcher!
The shout of a middle-aged man caught the attention of the group of merchants, a group of curious people turned to look in the distance, and a few eyes, the whole body was shaking!
The snow in the sky rustled and the sky turned black, and a mysterious golden coffin appeared in the mountain path, gradually becoming visible to the eyes of everyone.
The ancient gold sarcophagus is two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the walls are etched with quaint motifs and characters. The carved characters radiate a faint and faint light, isolating all the falling snowflakes from the outside, strange to the extreme.
Another little thing which frightened the crowd was the dragging of the coffin in front of the old sarcophagus.
It was a young man, who looked to be about fourteen or fifteen years old. He was bare and bare-headed, bowed on his back and clutching two heavy chains in his hands, and carrying them on his shoulders, was trying very hard to push the old casket forward step by step.
Ice and snow, young coffin!
The image is visually striking and captivating. Behind the golden casket, the glow is diffused by the dark light that shows the young man's body somewhat fuzzy, the face is not clearly visible, and the people are as if they see a God dragging the coffin.
This young man was born with a divine power.
And the middle-aged man cried again, and many turned to God and weighed the boy carefully, and made sure that there were no rays of the light from heaven shining on him, and began to move.
The usual casket of willow was three or four hundred kilograms, but this ancient casket was generally gold plated, not to mention at least three thousand kilograms.
A young boy without brawn is not a true martial artist. Even a strong man has only five or six hundred kilograms of super strength. A boy can pull three thousand kilograms of an old coffin, although it looks a little difficult, but it is surprising enough.
Young, attractive, handsome, young and handsome, come to carry the coffin, this young man wants to kill himself his whole life?
One elderly man expressed surprise, and many nodded their heads in agreement 。 This is unusual, but it happens occasionally in the history of the desert.
The most important members of the Northern Desert families were buried in large golden coffins. The giant coffins would not be buried in the ground, but placed at the foot of the iceberg. This would be said to protect the members of the tribe.
In a period of decline or death, the family will hold a funeral ceremony to find a new iceberg to move the family's ancestor's coffin, replace the wind and water and promote the welfare of the family.
This leads to the appearance of the coffin snatcher.
In many northern desert people, when the coffin is removed, the air transport is absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body's energy and longevity are also absorbed, causing paralysis or illness.
So the corpse is the most despicable profession in North Korea, and even if the commission is high, the young warriors won't get excited, only the aged warriors will be able to pick up the casket.
A young boy about 5 feet 7 inches tall, broad shoulders, narrow waist, long legs, and muscular body. He wears a primitive animal tooth on his neck that looks like a wild person.
Fourteen and fifteen years old, handsome, with a terrible body power and no bad youth conditions. And yet come to do this most base and disgraceful undertaker's life?
The old man looked at the gold coffin and said: "Looks like the coffin of the Liu family". Yes, I heard that the Liu family had recently experienced a big change, and that the price had risen sky-high.
The sound of a whistle, the people of Liu's family came. An old man suddenly spoke, and all the people of the caravan quickly shut their mouths, and gazed in the distance.
Whoa!
A distant noise of a wild beast, and a band of warriors in black armor, riding on silver big wolves, came rushing by, but not even close to the wolf with its breath came the fierce face.
The Silver Wolf Guard, the warriors of the House of Liu
People nodded their heads in darkness and all around the wall of the city of Wulin there was only one army riding on silver wolves, the silver wolves' guard, the most powerful of the Liu clan.
When the Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the youths, a middle-aged giant, a long whip in his hand, looked at the youth coldly and said: "Get away from the land, go fast! If you do not get to the black swan before dark, you will not get any reward".
The youngster, known as Lu Yi, looked up, surrounded by a dozen giant silver wolves, about one meter and two meters tall, he was not too afraid, and nodded: You can be sure, I will be there before dark.
In a whisper, the giant ran off with his Silver Wolf Guard, and soon disappeared into the distant mountains of the Yellow Banner.
He looked at his merchant guests and, quietly, continued to move the coffin. He grasped the chain of cold iron with his hands and went forward with effort with his shoulders, every step was extremely difficult, and all the muscles of his body trembled.
What a load!
After a few miles of travel, he came to a halt on a steep slope. He was exhausted and out of breath, and could not imagine what a burden that must have taken on his body.
He thought of resting and arranging the coffins; then sitting down on a stone and taking fresh water and dried meat from a bag behind him, he began to devour it with his mouth open to replenish his strength.
We should get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes soon brightened, he said to himself: a coffin can be exchanged for a daimyo, and he wondered if Liu's skeleton was a legend, one can add five hundred kilograms of power?
if I can really add 500 kilos to my strength, I have 3,000 kilos now, and I can only lift a dozen or so coffins and then reach 10,000 kilos, then I can... wake up the blood vessels!
And who else in the tribe would dare to bully my sister? Oh, I will soon get to have a good time with my sister.
Thinking of this, Lu Lu's tired face glowed, and he quickly pulled the coffin forward, this time he had more steady and fast feet.
Shashashashash! He was there.
When the man walked for some miles, he heard a voice behind him, and looked back, slightly puzzled.
The man behind him is also a barber, but he is an old man. The old man is holding an iron chain on his hand and is illuminated by the white light, and the white light is also hidden on his feet.
The white light is the super power of the martial artists. The power of the martial artists with super powers will increase a lot, this old man uses the super power, this will walk like a flying and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man followed him up the river and looked him over, and with a frown said, "O boy, why are you dragging the coffin? It might hurt your luck".
Lu Ying smiled and said nothing, the old man looked at him for a few moments, stopped talking, and quickly pulled the coffin away.
If she can't wake up the blood, what is the future? Just a life of toil and daily bullying, even sisters who are suffering.
No, this is not the life I want!
The thought of this made Landy's face a little warped, and he growled, biting his teeth and quickly dragging the coffin forward.
The snow is getting bigger, the sky is turning dimmer and darker, and the golden coffin's glimmer of light in the mountains is unusual and fascinating.
Chapter 001
My brother is going to go look for a job, you write your homework at home, this is 10 dollars, don't forget to go out to buy something to eat at lunchtime.
Lu was overheard banging her head in front of the door of a tiny shack in the slums, and it was so good to see her so healthy and so alive!
"Brother, I know, Little Lily kept complaining that she can't do my hair, it's because of you.
My sister Lu Xin is very thoughtful, she is very nice, helps Lu arrange her clothes and admonishes her like a little adult: "Mommy must work hard, Mom, then brother will suffer, I am confident he will find a job this time".
Don't worry, your brother will find a good job, make a lot of money, let him enjoy a good day, and then hug your sister, and secretly adding in his mind, he won't lose his life because of lack of money, but will watch you crying and crying.
When she grows up, she will earn a lot of money. The youngest girl twisted herself in Ru Yu's arms, and she swore with her little fist.
No matter how hard she tried, she didn't say goodbye to her sister.
Getting on the bus, he put his hands in his pocket for a few minutes and laughed bitterly.
What happened is that he had just given his sister money for lunch, and had put it back into his pocket.
In the 23rd century, technology is immensely advanced and intelligent technologies abound in every corner of the world, and this development has brought great advances in people's lives, but at the same time, it has reduced the need for human resources.
Unemployment is no longer a rare event, especially for those living at the bottom of this society, finding a stable job is a luxury.
If it hadn't been for the accident, he would have been unemployed forever.
He did not settle in until he joined a gaming syndicate, although the game had been open for almost a year when he joined the game called Cangguan Jia, and he had not managed to reach the ranks of the super-experts.
Two years later, her sister Lu Xin was found seriously ill during a school medical examination.
With no money to pay for millions of dollars' worth of medical treatment, he is being chased by several unions all the while in the game and can only look at his only loved one weakening day by day.
The taste was more painful than cutting flesh with a knife, and Lu was weeping in silence when she was hugged more than once.
But the fate changed. On the day of the notification, she went to sleep by her sister's bed, after crying for a few minutes, and woke up and realized that she had been reborn, three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister is still healthy, he knew that he had to earn money, a lot of money.
If she has the money, she can get her sister's disease cured as soon as possible and live a happy life like all the other beautiful girls of her age.
If you have money, you are proud and you never take yourself for granted.
In the end, Lu Yi was discouraged, and found it difficult to become rich, even if he was born again.
It looks as if the only thing he can do is play the game, and the one he played for more than two years is now just a few days away from opening.
Lu Yuan had given up on looking for a proper job, and came out today and went to the headquarters of the Star and Moon Trade Union where he worked in his previous life.
The Star and Moon Syndicate is not a game ten or a top four in China, it is just a game alliance consisting of a group of college students, whose heads are very rich and rich second generation, and it has the same development patterns because of the fact that they are unable to spend money.
The most beautiful place in the whole of this generation is the Chin Lake district next to the University City; water is on the side of the mountain, flowery terrain, office buildings in front and villas at the back, and only very wealthy people can start a company.
With some disgust, the front desk beauty glanced at Lu Hui's clothes, called a series of numbers and then told Lu Hui that she could go in for an interview.
We only recruit for the death row team at the moment, and the bettor won't pay the fees. We are hiring a girl who is dressed trendy, who puts nail polish on the side and does not raise her head during the interview.
The "death squad" is actually an artillery unit, and a dozen deaths a day is normal.
The reason why Lu Yi found a studio to join is to use the studio's helmet for free, even though the betting player has no future, but at least he can upgrade it, the canon's ashes are not for him to be able to upgrade it, and the death in the game will take away his experience.
What, 20 gold! Oh! Nail polish was rubbed on her face, the girl cried like a cat being trampled!?
Although it represents today's most advanced virtual technology, and has the world's best design team, but it is not confident in the market without the inside, only test content is relatively less, and it is a decentralized test, it will not have any impact on normal games.
After a few days of testing, the main impression for the players was that the gold coins are not very good and there were too many places to spend money.
The average player of the game can only make a small amount at the beginning, and an experienced bookie may only win a few coins a day.
A seasoned pro player estimates that it would take at least a week or even more for the average gamer to raise enough to form a union, build a union of 20 people and a hundred people to clean the proper scenes, removing the equipment and medicines, or to save enough money until the third system update.
Now this kid, he promised to give $20 in a week!
20 gold coins, which is 200,000 copper coins.
Hey, did you participate in inside page, or did you find a bug?
The land laughed and said nothing, seemed very tall and deep.
Hey, arrogant, I have something, come and see me...well, someone comes to apply for a bank teller, who says that they will pay twenty dollars in a week, I suspect he has a money-money BUG, you can't hire a beautiful girl, you can just call the higher up.
It wasn't long before there was a rush of footsteps. When I turned around, I was a bit surprised to see Lu leaving.
The people who came, in addition to the old, proud sword of Star Moon, actually followed several people, who died two years ago in the Star Moon Union. Most of these people knew, all of them were high level of the union.
Oh, don't tell me, the one who can make twenty gold coins a week is the boy, the one that walks beside arrogant sword cannot stop crying, this guy's name is Half Smoke, he is a captain of the brigade of thieves of the Star and Moon Union, he's a very capricious person.
Oh, you can earn 20 gold coins in a week and be sure it's the game of Yang Gung-T'ai? Oh, the face of the arrogant Sword wasn't that pretty, it was supposed to hold a line of hope, but seeing the appearance of Lu Yi, this line has been lost.
The look of Lu Lu is ordinary, his face is dark brown, his clothes are blurry, there are traces of worn lines in the corners which make it clear that he is a person who is at the bottom of society.
You say that you have no excuse, and even if you do not get it you do not lose much, right? In the face of the vast airfield, the social elite behind the front, without the tension of the people at the bottom, only a faint smile and calm look seemed to be full of endless faith.
Chapter One
So Yemmer, Yemmer, you're alright, hurry up, we're going to school soon, this class is ruthlessly cold, you'll hurry up. A somewhat urgent voice echoed in Yemmer's ear. Yemmer had a very strange feeling.
That idiot, who was supposed to be faceless, covered his face. Another voice was ringing in his ears, but now Yemir was awake.
Yemer looked around a bit, no one he knew, only strange faces.
It was clear from his face that all of them were laughing at him, that those around him seemed to be laughing at him, and he didn't dare ask a question, but he kept a low profile to avoid being touched.
Looking at the fellow student sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who hadn't laughed at himself, but who had just kindly pushed himself awake.
"What do I look like a school?" asked his surprised subconscious.
"Ha, ha... another round of laughing.
Yuhmyo, I see you are mad, can Yuhmyo also write love letters? You were good to him, and now you are no longer a member of Yuhmyo, be careful in the future.
Of course, he did not believe that Yemer would forget all about him, but that he would love him for only a few moments. He had not yet recognized reality, he was no longer the Yemer of the house.
Yemar's first moments of pain, he remembers how he and his Master were exercising in Yuan Danshi, and then the swarm of the Westergates came by, and then the explosions and all kinds of shrieks and he remembers his Master holding a piece of string behind him, and how he had come to be here? Is this the land of the Moon or the Land of the Moon?
Why is he sitting here now, master? The master was only three years older than him. And what's more, Sir Solomon attacked them because he was too handsome to do so. When he was rejected by Sir Solomon, the younger lord of Sir Solomon wanted to marry his beautiful mother-in-law.
If the master should fall into the hands of the West Gate, the consequences are unimaginable, and thinking about this, Yemer couldn't bear the internal panic anymore and suddenly stood up.
What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell rang? A young girl with a clear face walked up on the stage with a few books on her hands, coldly glanced down the hall at the laughing students and the laughter stopped.
Everyone knows that English lecturer Yun Yi, the most annoying thing is that the students are upset, and once she is upset, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Yemer has felt something was wrong, though he heard these words, but the obvious language is not his original use, is this not the mainland of Lo Man now?
However, after his father's death, Yemer was expelled from his family because he was not the father's offspring. To be more accurate, after the death of Yemer's father, Yemer's bloodline was re-identified once again, and it was recognized as not the offspring of the Yemer family. This was why he was expelled from the Yemen.
However, he also has a sister Ye Ye, a brother Ye Jian, but he is not a mother, but his half brother. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he was indebted to Ye, and he proposed to Ye's older brother, Ye Tian, who may well have known his ill-health. So, to help Ye find a place to stay in the mountains, he found Ning's home in Qingdao.
Of course, the Ning family was very willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in Hwangsha.
At a medical exam in a hospital, Yeamer was examined for swine, and confessed that he was unhuman. Although Ye family tried to hide the fact, it seems that overnight, the whole of the city of Beijing knew that the Ye family of one of the Five Great Families of the Chinese Empire had a swan.
Ooooohh...my memories were flicked here, so Yemer shouts with a shock, stood up, almost removed his collar to see. He had some understanding that he could be reborn into a person by the same name as Yemer, but he was not human, it was better than killing him.
"Hey there classmate, what's your name, what's your crying in class, come to my office for class. Hi, you are speaking with a beautiful teacher who was interrupted by the shock of Yemmer and her face looks very bad. "
The rest of the class is just laughin' to themselves, they didn't move a student to go to the office, but they thought that the only one who did it, was the English teacher, they left their grade in the hands of people.
Yamer took a seat, even though he did not know much about the inner workings of the family's struggle, but some understand he was likely expelled from the family as a fool, not necessarily because he was not a member of the family and who knows if DNA tests are a prank.
Yemer didn't worry about being thrown out of the house, and he didn't care about that at all. He was concerned about his own swans. He was worried about what would become of his teacher Lo Shida.
But he also understood why his classmates were laughing, as his former teacher had been kicked out of the Ye Family and was still obsessed by pursuing the hottest girl in the class. As a result, they hung their confession books on the board and stood on the podium looking down at themselves saying: "Yeah, can you sleep with me?
After the news of his birth was published, he was ashamed to see his face and wanted to find a girlfriend, but he did not think that his daughter had been so rude to him, but this had passed, and it was worth it for him to be born again.
I was born in such a place! He did not hear a single word of the lesson of the beautiful teacher on the podium. He heard, and I did not go to hear, for him now is a silly thing, and he absolutely cannot accept that. Instead of being reborn this way, it's better not to be born again.
If he can't get to the university it's no big deal, but the main thing is to figure out his situation at the moment. His problem is the Ye family's reputation, although he was thrown out of Ye's family, but who knows if he will be suddenly killed?
The first thing that emerged from his study, of course, was to not go to the beautiful teacher, but rush out of the school, looking for a place to look at his **, to see if he was truly naive.
There are not many other things to do near Ninghai University, but there are some small streets, so Yemeru runs into a small and deserted alley and hurries to pull off his skirt.
The little cock is very small, but Yemer is really very breathless not because the little cock was disappointed, but really has a long breath. He is not a swan, but because the little cock is too big, blocked by a blood vessel, which caused this fake swan situation.
But it's that way, with the technology on earth today to want to open your blocked veins, is undoubtedly a fool's dream, but it's hard to defeat Yemer, although he still has not been able to open the blocked veins to allow his little f*cking man to grow up, but as soon as he reaches the third level of the air, this vein will be automatically purged.
It is only that Ye'mer immediately began to get a little disappointed, because in the light conditions on this earth, wanting to train to the three levels of the Zen, no doubt, is a difficult task, and maybe he won't be able to reach his life, otherwise he would still be equal to the swan. A sigh, Ye'mer was trying to pull his sword, and suddenly a shout made him a shell.
"Oh, bandit...! oh, the woman who absolutely has a high pitched voice is right in front of Yemer, who just left to check his own ****, forgetting to see the surroundings. I did not think that this little alley was connected, only the turn here ahead is invisible. "
Yet, even though he is not an exhibitionist, and he does not have any capital to expose, he hasten to pull his socks up and sneak away.
Yemar, how are you? the woman screamed and asked in a surprised tone, and it was obvious that she knew Yemer.
Chapter 1
The night is quiet, in the Qinghai High School.
He was sitting quietly on a soft leather sofa with a stack of papers in his hand, looking out of the landing window at the pool, full of loss and resentment.
He is the leader of a shadowy team from one of the four major game studios in Jinhai city, commanders of large public gatherings of tens of thousands of people, and the best-known sword-wielding magician in Jinhai, but now he can only sit at home and drink his heart out.
Ten years in the game.
Ten years of bloodshed.
After countless sufferings and trials, he finally led the Ghost Council to establish ten major city-states in the shadow of the temple of Qiao and began to compete with the First Council, enjoying endless glory, and the paper became a cloud of smoke, and went away forever.
Shifeng never thought that his ten years of work would be in vain, for the sake of the game, he gave up so much, and in the end he became a gown for another person, all because he opposed the ghost and joined the super community, which is the world.
But he only has five million credit points and a mansion, and it is less than a nickel compared to the ten largest cities built by the virtual kingdom of Shinzo Takanama.
Shi Feng thinks that he paid so much for a shadow, making the Blue Hua group into a big corporation, and it's a great credit to him, but the result is like throwing garbage, throwing him, for the actions of the Blue Hua consortium, he will surely get revenge.
I wouldn't have thought of it that way, and I would never come back.
He was filled with confidence and determination, and the paper in his hand was torn to shreds, and he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and poured in a few more.
Without the Sword King account and without the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, the player can rise in the God Realm and again build his own virtual kingdom.
In the morning, the sun was just rising.
The drip!
The phone is ringing.
The next morning he woke up, unable to get out of bed, and picking up his cell phone from his bedside, he was still hanging from last night's hangover.
Hey, what's going on?
I'm black, what do you want to know, we said to be a professional player, but today is the day of recruitment at the school's Ghost Studios, and haven't you always wanted to be the core of the Ghost?
The stone peak is a bit confused.
Why do you go to the ghost evaluation after being fired by Blue China Group?
Are you listening? They're just going to make the test at ten o'clock. If you don't hurry and come here, you won't be able to make it.
Don't be kidding me, I was just fired by a ghost.
Zheng Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? You haven't woken up yet, the shadow hasn't invited anyone, how'd you get fired? Please come quickly 😐
When she didn't hear back from Stone, she hung up the phone.
In his confusion, Kijang looked at his phone and realised that this old phone was not his phone at all, instead it was the latest version called "12".
The room was less than 15 square meters, it was cluttered with books about strategy games and laptops on the desk at the corner of the wall, a very old model with a large wardrobe on the wall with many clothes scattered, and a familiar face in the fitting room mirror.
When Shifu saw this familiar face, she was shocked.
He immediately got up and went to the fitting room, where he did it again and again, until he became really young.
Yesterday I slept in a spacious, luxurious bedroom, today I wake up in this broken place and am young.
For this place, the stone hills have some memories. It was ten years ago, to buy a small house on the top of the war temple area, lived for more than half a year, then spent some time in the temple area, rented a large apartment-style house in the city.
But, it was a difficult year, the family wasn't doing well, and in order for him to be able to go to university and be in a lot of debt, his parents had to work hard to earn enough money every month and send him enough money to support them.
He was thinking about how to make some money to change his homeland, but college students were all over the street, trying to find a good paying job is harder than getting to heaven, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game, to improve the game technology, he is determined to buy a virtual helmet, which has become a professional player in aim to skill in virtual games.
That time, he ate white noodles and bubble wrap every day to save money, and did not participate in any of the class meetings or social events, so the class became a little transparent, the boys looked down on, and the girls looked away, every time he went to the supermarket to buy bubble wrap, but he did not have ten credit points in his wallet, and even a single credit point of ham sausage he was afraid to buy, the businesswoman looked at the poor man at Shifeng and recommended special price ham, Shifeng looked at the tempting ham, touched the wallet again, or refused to bite his teeth.
Who's playing with me?
Shi Feng, looking at the familiar scene and the younger self in the mirror, shook his head, denying the idea.
Who would joke with a decrepit grandfather that not even the most developed of America has technology to bring back the old child.
He looked at the time on his phone again.
It is the 19th of April, 2129.
The next day, the first morning in a new life, I was born again, but I'm not that old anymore.
He remembers that today is August 5, 2139, not April, 2129 when he was still at high school.
Shifu shook his head, trying to wake up, but still with a glimmer of hope, wishing that he would be reborn, really back to ten years ago, so he went to the desk and opened up the laptop.
If you can fake the time on a cell phone, you can't fake the news on the internet.
After a few minutes online.
He was shocked, because all the information he was looking up on the Internet showed that today is April 19, 2129 and even the official opening time of the Global Fire Temple was on its official website. The countdown is clear, six days later on April 25
Did I really go back 10 years ago? @kathir_pumpit looks on the news of the shrine, and leaves with tears of excitement in his eyes.
At this time, there are many expressions of regret, sorrow and joy.
As if everything in front of me were a dream.
But the ringing of the windows and the cold air from the air conditioning reminded me that Stonehenge is real.
Looking at the photos of his family at university in the phone, Shifeng never noticed that his father had grey hair, his mother's eyes were wrinkled, and that they were really old and not as vibrant as they used to be.
When he noticed that his parents were older, it was about a year and a half after the opening of the sanctuary, and the high debt, overwork and stress had made them both seriously ill, and he needed millions of credit points to recover from illness, but Stone Peak was a small shadow captain and the money he earned couldn't pay for such expensive expenses.
Shifeng tried everything to get money, but it wasn't enough, even though he did everything he could to support himself, and his parents left after a few months.
He did not take good care of his parents in his previous life and who knows the pain and regrets?
Even after reaching millions of credit points later, it became a pain in his heart forever
It was an unexpected turn of fortune for him, but he had to start from scratch, everything was back to the beginning.
Oh good, very good, haha. When I was born again, I was going to change it all, make enough money, cure my parents, not let them work for a living. So Zhi Xi wiped the tears from his eyes, secretly vowed.
Just as Shifeng was planning his future, the Negro called him again, urging him to go to the university.
But despite this she still managed to dress, pack up and head off to Kinghai University.
He is more familiar with the shadows.
When he was in college, the blue sea dragon, the eldest son of the Blue Sea Dragon, opened a ghost studio, and provided a lot of funds, organizing the top students in the Jinhai University, the Campaign, when he also examined, and became a core member, the Negro became the peripheral member, and then he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, the Ghost Studio had his leadership, let the Blue Hu Group become a large conglomerate in the realm of the Gods, and it was unexpectedly eventually eliminated by the Blue Sea Dragon.
Now that he's reincarnated, he still has the unparalleled advantage of the god-space, naturally is not ready to join the shadow again, become someone else's tool, making money for others, he has to go a different way, he has to fight for his life, do not have to let his parents send his living expenses, pay all the debts, so he has to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, have a good day.
When Stone Peak arrived at the first building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man come to the main gate in a hurry, this person was black.
Zhou Feng, you have finally come, it's good that there is no deadline for registration, let's go in and register quickly.
Then Stone Mountain shook his head and said in all seriousness, "Cowboy, I'm not ready to go to the ghost, I want to open my own studio, will you come?"
Black and black met in a virtual game, technology is very good, then together on the air, can be said to be brothers, working together in the shadow days, black although no gaming talent, but the management very strong, put the community of hundreds of thousands of wells in the wells of the organization, if there is a Black help to achieve the goal will be further, but he will follow the choice of black, after all, he is now has nothing, black is home situation is not good, to live only decided to become a professional player, join the shadow life for a fee.
After a little more than a minute, the black man looked up at the rock.
Mr. Fang Feng, stop talking like a fool, do you know what the price of a virtual helmet is? That is eight thousand credit points, open a studio, at least six people, have to work, and pay wages, etc. Starting out cost seven and eighty thousand, there are subsequent investments, but that is not a lot of money, but now you have that much money?
You were right, I don't even have the money to buy a virtual helmet for the game. Zhang Xian nodded quietly, admitting that, as Black said, even 780,000 is less, recalling that the 100-strong studio recruited by Blue Sky Dragon spent more than 500 million dollars and subsequently spent a lot to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
If that's the case, then why do we take the risk to go to the ghost, it's not more stable, at least the ghost can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise, we can't even play, let alone become professional players.
Shi Feng opened his hand, looked at him earnestly, and said: But I'm still going to open my own studio, I don't want to be controlled by people, you come?
Shifu is not forcing his way into the black, because he has no security, and cannot reveal the secrets of his reincarnation, but just wants his friend to believe him.
The blacks felt that it was strange, they felt that it was too crazy, they felt that it was impossible to earn money in the first days of the game, and it is all known, are there any way for the Blacks to make money in the temple? even if they have to earn money in a few months, they don't have that much time to lose.
The Negro hesitated half of the day, bit his teeth, and finally answered: "I know, who made you my big brother, I want to start a studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, we can't play the game without a helmet?"
Shifeng suddenly felt a little less nervous, happily patted Ni'er's shoulder, laughed: "Hey, this is my good brother, don't worry about the virtual helmet, I remember that there was a special offer for students to try it on, and every university has it, if you can use your student ID card, you can get the virtual helmet for free for ten days, let's see for ourselves. "
A black person with a grayish brown face, feeling that his future is a shadow, why do you believe in Shifeng? Is it the kind of confidence and security that Shifeng has? Is it really okay to start a business with shifeng?
What to do in the temple in ten days?
Ten days later, you will definitely miss the opportunity to recruit people from the big studios, you will not start to buy a virtual helmet, but where will you get your money?
You are trying to gain 16,000 credits in the first 10 days of the game, but not even a team of professional players would do it!
Leave the problem of making money to me.
Shigefugu patted Nago on the shoulder, revealing a confident smile.
Ten days at 16.000 credits is fantastic, but he has the courage of rebirths, he will break through any difficulties one by one. And the opening of the sacred domain is the beginning of his rise.
Then Shif-Fong took some black men to try on the helmet, and put all the money into making a convenient meal, put it by the computer desk in the rental room, two full boxes, enough to eat for more than ten days, and then handed over some things to the temple, and quietly waited for the opening of the temple.
At 9 p.m. on April 25, some lights twinkled in the dark, silent hut.
Shinji was lying in bed with his eyes closed, and gently touched the start button on his helmet.
My God, I have come.
But I could not understand what it was, for it seemed to go through the ears and into the soul, and I was forced to take a couple of snaps in this cold, snowy night.
The cold north wind passes over the heavens, and the sleet dances with the wind, and tears the branches of the willows in pieces, and a layer covereth the earth, and the far-away looketh, and is desolate when silver is in its clothing.
It was not the middle of the night, just the twilight, but the faintness of the sky was like the dark night, giving a feeling of silence, as if pressed to the heart, and breathless. In that silver landscape, a huge contour can be seen, a majestic city pool, as if the monster were looming.
In the center of the city-pond, there was a lofty tower like altar, shaped in septenaries, all dark, straight cloud peak, standing in the midst of a violent snow storm motionless, that altar in the sound of a tornado blowing on it, is mixed with the sound of this karakara, scattered far and wide, with the original rough, and there is no other purpose.
The sands, the noise of the sand, rose from the altar in the snow, mingled with the wind, as if they were not distinguished.
If there is hope, where is the hope, and if there is no hope, why must I see it? The voice of the eagle, like that of a madman, almost like hysterics, swirling round and round in nine days.
Behind the altar, at that moment, there were innumerable figures dressed in robes, standing there silently, looking far and far away, there were hundreds of thousands, men and women, surrounding the altar all around, packed together, not moving, but there was a feverish emergence, as if a man on the altar, in a word, they could give everything for it.
Snow is bigger.
Oh, now that you let me see, there must be hope, but there is no hope... where? The voice of the sand on the altar, filled with bitterness, full of sadness, did not last for a long time.
"The morning of that day was mistaken, the night was barren, and the snow came down, and all was newly born, and the old man was going to be a beast. The noise grew so loud, the father had no idea what to do, but saw the wind change its colour on the sky, the countless snowflakes all suddenly stopped, and then all rolled up, and the whistle came from the four corners, so the earth and the earth trembled.
At that time there was no more snow falling in the sky, but all the snow gathered to form a great snow-colored dragon. As soon as it was formed, it immediately roared through the sky and its sound resounded in the ears, so that all who heard it immediately trembled, as if torn by the sound.
A throb of frightful blood came out from the dragon's body and spread rapidly over its whole body, making the dragon like a blood dragon, its mighty tail, struggling fiercely toward the sky, like a wild meteor straight into the sky, as if to blow the day into a cave, open a hope.
Its speed, its endless turn of eyes, the thundering whirlpool, like this dragon hit on some invisible membrane, the heavens and the earth shook, the cry spread in all directions, the blood dragon again shouted terrifyingly, the body collapsed in layers with the speed visible to the naked eye.
At the instant it was about to completely crumble, hundreds of thousands of silent people below the altar, all with folded hands and biting tongue tips, spit a mouthful of blood, as if drawn by a force, which rushed up like a sea of blood to the sky and went straight to the blood dragon in the collapse, and when it was fused with it, the collapse of this dragon was mitigated and rushed to a higher horizon.
Look at that blood dragon flying higher and higher, concentrating everyone's attention, but at that moment, the blood dragon was a massive tremor all over the body, after sending a great noise spread over tens of thousands of miles, could not stop the collapse of the body, turned into countless blood-colored snow, falling down, seeing in the distance that the earth and sky have been dyed into a red spring of sulphur.
It's also in this very moment, the moment when the blood dragon collapsed, a sound completely different from that of the beast came out of its mouth!
And there was an old man sitting in the middle of the altar, and he was clothed in a purple robe, with wrinkles on his face, and all his flesh full of spots, and his eyes were dark, and in his eyes were rays; for he was a blind man.
He has a complete backbone placed before him, a spine of a whitish-brown coyote, and a stone in his right hand resting on the thirteenth vertebra.
His empty eyes gaze silently at the sky, for a long, long, long, long sigh.
As he spoke, his right hand, which held the stone, moved again upon the strange spine, and, rubbing the animal's bones, uttered a howl that spread into the distance, and which bore the figure of Joseph, merged with a sound of sad loneliness and desolation.
The night is dark, and the mountains are troubled with the wolves; the wild beasts roam about, and the mountains and the rivers are shaken, and the woods are trembling, and the leaves fall.
And there was a roar from the forest, and the deer shrieked, and the leaves fell from its body; and he saw the mountains in the darkness, and sighed in his heart, How very unlike this earth is!
He was sitting under the tree and some of the boys were looking at him with a look of contempt, but one of them even rushed him, and shouted: "Don't let a foreigner in your village let you eat dry food, but hurry to work!".
Linguini returned to God, without saying a word, slapped his ass stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the fat boy shouted, "You useless waste, no better than a boy, throw him to the mountain, to be eaten by the wild animals".
Aside from the wolves, what about you, brothers passing through the earth, how are you stronger than those animals?
The world of the Divine is a world ruled by monks.
This village of the wolves, although a small village in the mountains of Zhuge Liang, of course, no monks, but every villager hard practice martial arts and fight, not even the women and children are an exception.
This is the only way to survive in a world where monsters roam, even in those ancient races that have gone extinct.
As in our case, though it is late at night, the young men and women of the village go hunting in the mountains, many of the game are accustomed to the night and there is a danger of going into the mountains at night, but the harvest is still greater.
The villagers are accustomed to this life, and the children who stay in the village do not sleep, they gather to play tricks and wait for their elders to come back for the hunt.
The little children also dragged their nose, playing carelessly with the hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, and a group of teenagers were competing to see who can lift the village's massive one-thousand pound stone.
The lion looked at the cattle, and sighed, and spoke with them, and it was true that it looked like a piece of wood.
This does not make Lin Jiang feel bad though he is constantly spoken of behind his back, but he is temporarily staying in the small mountain village called the Wolf Village due to his ignorance. What really hurt Lin Jiang is that he has more than one thing on his mind.
The Supergrandfather system.
In the beginning, Lin Ming was relieved to think that crossing would be a benefit, but the first line of the system put him in a good mood.
The main line of the Yuen System mission: Host Yue Wei, build the world's first great door here, and become the first grandfather.
The main quest is divided into different stages, each stage is required to be completed within a limited time, overtime is not completed, and directly kill the host!
The Lin Yi looked at the systematic explanations, and especially the last sentence: "You killed the host hen", remained silent for half a day, and finally, squeezed a few words out of his teeth: "Oh, I bought a watch last year!
After this anger, Lin Yang read the task, and was desperate, he was not prepared to risk challenging the system to see if the opponent would actually kill him, because the world was not yet a hot fuck, and he did not want to die again.
The Main Line Mission 1.0 will house the four clothing disciples.
The mission statement is: Even if it is a layman, who wants to inherit his own robe, he should also be a disciple. The most important resource of a school is always people, who are talented and gifted disciples to preach, the famous to teach, famous to teach, even more difficult.
Mission: One year, overtime not completed, direct destruction of the host.
Oh my foul pit! My foul tree sighed, and said, The new man, who has just passed through, is as tender as a little cauliflower, should I hurry to find a bull as a teacher, and hug his thighs?
Brother of the system, you have to ask me for the secret, to receive the pupil, this poor one, what do you want me to teach the house? Ignorance and arrogance?
What's even worse, the system indicates that there is a new member gift but informs itself that there is a malfunction in the gift system, and the delayed release of the new member gift made Lin Ming lament that there is no new member gift but there is a bigger one.
The system of exchange that is opened is instead full of all kinds of good things, the riches of the Rinthan, the magic of the Kung Fu, only you do not think, without him there is no cargo.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Yan doesn't have any point to exchange at this point, and can only rush the system.
While the boar was cursing her, the village was suddenly in uproar, as if the hunting party had returned.
The boys who were waiting in the village all cheered and went up to the gate, and Lin Zhao glanced over, but was shocked to find that the men who had returned from hunting were empty-handed, with no game or even weapons.
For these villagers, weapons are second life, living in the mountains and not being able to live without weapons.
Lin Feng nodded a silent smile: You seem to have a story. Thinking about that, he turned to the people of the village.
Before he got there, he heard someone moaning, 'The thunderbolt was the hope of our village, and now the people of Stone Village have been badly hit, and we can not rest.'
And the child of Shelah lifted up his eyes, and saw in the midst of the multitude a young man sitting with a raging spirit, full of blemishes and with cold light of hate in his eyes.
Is this the genius that the Wolf Village people put in the mouth? Liu Lin Lin peeked, for this werewolf, he is also famous for a long time, the idol of the entire Wolf Village youth, is considered to be the hope of the village, Today, Lin Lin is the first to see real people
Although the wolf wind is now wounded, his spirit is weak, but his spirit is full of blood, and although his physical strength cannot be compared with the monk, it is definitely the top of the secular martial artists.
According to the general theory of the Taiwan world, young people have this level, if they practice the practice of air, they will also have a future, and the practitioner says, in the end, it is to guide the entry of the breath of the universe and the spirit, temper the Fa power, and strengthen their roots.
Lin Sheng is still tuning out his own super ancestors system, which has the pupils talent detector, and he is determined to press the Wolf Wind.
This object is too low to be a disciple of the host.
Lin Yu frowned, the system was also too picky, he was going to take four students at random, mess up the system's one-year deadline and finally drive these students out of the gate.
But it seems that it is not that easy to drill a hole in the system, even such a talented boy as Wolfwind is not qualified enough, Lin Yang wants to get four disciples to complete the system's task, the difficulty is too big.
After a year, a year.....Jinrin sighed solemnly
Among the crowd, an old man with a brown face, shouted, "Hungry Hingry is my grandson, this of course can't be regarded as such, but not now". The last few days were pretty quiet in the mountains, and it seems that someone is going to be born, first to get the treasure, then to settle accounts with Stone Village!
There was a lot of gun battles between the villagers, and Lin was not interested in this, but he was moved by two words from the elder brother.
Lin Ming was grinding on the mountain treasure, when suddenly, he heard someone in the crowd whispering cursing: "You don't know how Stone Village raised such a small monster, less than four years old, and that a small baby girl could defeat the genius Wolfwind of our village, what a devil!"
Her eyes suddenly lit up.
The girl, who is just under four years old, was able to defeat the werewolf in front of her.
Werewolves do already count several talents, and the man who hurt him is not even four years old, what kind of gift?
The fat boy next to him whispered, "You fuckin' bastard, you've got to kill him!"
Lin Lin looked at him, and said, "Yes, yes, yes".
However, the thought in his mind that the little doll might be recognized by the system. As he thought about that, Lin Lin unabashedly withdrew from the crowd, and now had to spread his wings and fly to Shigashira immediately, but he didn't dare to leave the village alone, otherwise, he could have just fed the beast in the mountain.
Just at that moment, the warning sound of a mechanical dumbboard suddenly began to sound in Lin's mind.
I just posted the newest gift packages for you. Will you check them out now?
After a short pause, Lin was pleased, as he had never thought that the boring, dull system prompts were so delightful to listen to.
If you look for a quiet place where no one is, Lin Yan opens up a gift bag.
The newest gift package: The host will receive the basic training for four levels of the practice period, a chance to win a prize, 300 points to exchange points, a nine-hour Tao-Facing secret, a nine-day Tao-Facing guide for Shinto.
The warmth of the air that rushed from the top of his head down through his chest, opened a hidden hole in his body.
There are twelve important cavities hidden in the human body, which the practitioners call the Twelve Rooms.
The practice of the Pratyayaa period, which is divided into twelve levels, is to open the twelve weight rooms. Each cavity is opened, and the spirit is transformed into a power of the Buddha, and the practitioner's power goes up a step.
Lin Xiang now felt a heat current, and along the way, it did not disappear until after opening the four holes in his body. As Ling Xiang breathed, the air from the outside world was rapidly absorbed into the body, circulating in the four holes that were opened.
Each crater is like a continuously moving cluster of stars, the spiritual spirit continuously transformed into the magical power of Rinpoche himself, as the beginning of the flood of the universe, the evolution of all living creatures in general.
Lin Lin felt that his whole body became light and strong, his mind was in movement, the magic power in the cave was like a fountain, the explosive strength was stirred.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the physical changes, and he was relieved: He has some self-preservation power in the end. But considering the system's ultimate goal is to build the first door in history, and he wants to become the first grandfather in history, Lin Feng once again stressed, he rushed to check out the other things in the novices' gift bags.
In the assisted practice system, in addition to the exchange system, there is also the prize system, but it is gray, still in an un-activated state, do not have to think about it for a while.
At the moment, we can only hope that the 300 points would have a higher purchasing power.
While thinking about it, Lin Liang went into the exchange system, and he did not dare to look at the price even though it was cheap.
Looking closely at the price, Lin Xiang blames the black heart of the system, a bottle of the lowest quality of the spirits, it takes ten points to exchange, a slightly spiritual iron sword costs thirty points.
The idea is to make a basic head, a set of wings, a crown, 50 points.
The most basic deities, such as the fire ball, the heart-thunderbolt, require a hundred points.
As for those with the number zero's behind their butts, Lin Yi did not dare to look at them for fear of tears.
Lin Yue, who is looking at his father's existing exchange points and counting the poor 300 in one tank, shook his head: "You have too little money to start".
It's a good idea for beginners to bring a book of the Buddha's secrets and a spell, or Lin Feng will be caught blind.
It is a foundational practice aimed at raising the level of one's level of practice, whereas Shinto is a practical martial art or magic technique with many uses.
Surprisingly, the quality of the 9-bit ThunderCode is so high that not even the existing exchange system can change it, which must be upgraded before it can be changed.
As for system upgrades, it is still too early to say it will be launched after Lin Feng completes a certain number of system tasks.
Ninja T'ai Chi Ch'uan is one of the most advanced tai chi systems of the world, although it has been lost to history for many years. The pioneers who practiced the technique in the past were each one of them.
According to the instructions, the beginner's gift bag is a random opening of a do, the nine-ton-ton system of correction, Lin Feng is counting the graves of the ancestors to take a fresh smoke, 300 tons of change points although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng is now heart broken.
If there wasn't that fucking main line task, Lin Feng would have had to find a deserted place to practice his own art and then be able to go out and do something else.
But now that he was going to the disciples, it is a different story.
Despite the protests, Lin quickly adjusted her attitude and acted quickly.
After silently asking for directions to Ishimura, he left the village without arousing others.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility and have become a refuge for monks who are not afraid of the danger to the villagers, but rather the fear that they will expose their identities to the people of stone village.
Fortunately, now that the villagers had gathered at the village gate, and the question of who was beaten up by Wolfwind had come up, he went out of the village behind the village and nobody noticed him.
Walking on the road Lin Yi did not hesitate to invest directly in fifty change points to start making money for himself.
How could Lin Lin from Earth not know that Buddhists want golden jewellery and people want a suit of clothes, and if you want to sell something, advertising and packaging needs to be done first.
Looking down at his feathered crown, white robe, wide sleeves, a group of fairy winds and fairy bones, the image of a great man, Lin Yi is satisfied with the little things, the system stuff is expensive, but the quality of the picture is really not said.
When Lin Zhao arrived at the Ishimura village, the first thing he saw in his eyes was a huge dead tree with a trunk of ten meters in diameter that was completely charred.
For a moment, Lin Ye thought about it, then said it was a thunder-struck tree which had been struck by lightning many years ago, and the enormous tops and life-blood of the old trees had been destroyed; and now only a shrub, eight or nine meters high, was left on the surface of the ground.
But just looking at the size of the existing trunks, we can only imagine how big the tree was when it was alive.
The dead trees were black and there was no sign of life.
At that time, an old man came by, coughing and saying: "This tree has been dead for ten years". He went to Lin Lin with his eyes up and down, "Young man is the village chief of this village, can we help the chief? "
Lin Yi smiles, his body naturally reveals a breath of dust and arrogance, and his body is dressed up in a white robe, broad sleeves, and a feathered crown. He is completely unpretentious, absolutely high-class out of this world.
The target has been found, and is suitable for the host's first mate,.
When Lin was about to speak, he heard a sudden system prompt and almost wet his mouth.
The old Ishimura looked at Lin Ming with a strange look, but he was frightened.
Just see the two green eyes of the leopard, beating like a hungry wolf in the village.
In the village, a sweet and beautiful child is dragging the tail of a big yellow dog, and the child shouts loudly and clearly: "Mummy, don't run!"
The system sounds in his mind: The talent system is all set, the first target information is as follows:
The number of the bones of the body is 10, the number of the wisdom is 8, the number of the heart is 8, the number of the blessings is 8
Summary: The goal is very high, it is recommended to keep the income below the income and carefully teach them, as a pillar of the religion.
Lin Feng could not see anything else, but instead stared at the blood red number behind the collarbone.
10 bones, what does it mean?
For instance, someone is running, it takes 100 meters from the start to the finish and the end is the same, but the little one starts from the place of 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder he couldn't have the face full of peach blossoms before he was four years old.
At that moment, Li Ming was spotted, with a face that looked sad, big eyes, and a 10-foot-high beak.
Lin stopped her mouth, this is not only strong, but also the intellect, the heart, and the luck of the supergenius level.
Is it a little stressful to be an apprentice in this field?
Lin Lian was grinning, and a warm smile was appearing on his face.
If those who knew Lin Yi in a previous life had seen him reveal such a smile, they would have hidden away a long time ago.
Chapter 1
The morning sun, streaming in through the silver veil, has fallen upon the bed, and her prickly eyes are not open.
At a party last night, she was happy to get drunk and then Lu Yan Yan picked her up.
Time sat up, the sheen of silk slipped, a blush of red was revealed on the white sheets, and on herself the pale skin was covered with kiss marks.
This is the result of a night of pleasure.
I love you.
When he came to his mother, the words of his affection touched people, as if they were in his ears. The face of the time was filled with cherry blossoms, tears shy, and turned to look around.
And what of the 'Aad?
Are you out to buy breakfast?
She slipped the covers down, and when her legs touched the ground, she nearly fell to the ground.
As the light returned, Lu Yan Yan also returned, impatient and slowly walking into the living room, his body, with a strong and oppressive air.
Time lifts its eyes and falls into a pair of tears, and their eyes are silenced by the depth of unfathomable serenity.
For the first time, there was an intimate relationship, and for a while I was a little shy. Tears fell, and I did not dare to look at him.
In her frenzy, she vaguely heard him saying he was going to surprise her.
Is he going to propose to her?
The time was unpredictable and our hearts were beating.
As soon as she spoke, she was cut off by the voice of the thunderous "Oh good-bye, goodbye"
What did he just say, break up?
Is he going to surprise her or break up with her?
Is he joking with her, or is he telling the truth about breaking up with her?
A voice that cried out with pain, hidden in the throat, but could not break through, half-sound, and only time recovered its voice.
After we part, after we have a relationship,... after that, Lu Yan Yan, what do you mean?
There was no change in the indifference of Liu Yanjia, the one who called me last night and asked me to pick her up, or the one who hugged me to death and told me not to stop, and you also enjoyed last night.
Time is stopped by lightning!
She stared wide-eyed and stared at the man who was so different from her memories, couldn't keep her eyes from widening, and with difficulty said three words: "Why?"
When he finished, he turned to look out the window with a faint smile.
The smile seemed to be in the time, as a mockery.
The face of the hour was as white as snow, a bitter pain arose from her heart, pressing the nerve endings to the limbs, and a shadow fell on her, and she held her hand to the heart, but did not allow herself to tremble.
The air was suddenly filled with a cold, thick and steamy moisture that made the man shiver, suffocate, and could not stand a minute longer.
Time is running out.
Chapter 1
In the country of rain, there's the moon in the middle of the sky.
It took Lin Linhu a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he was indeed reincarnated.
For someone with a supernatural ability to take ten seconds to confirm something, is absolutely incredible, but it also shows just how unbelievable what happened to him is.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of the martial arts and had unparalleled achievements in the martial art, his pioneering technique of the three fires led by Liu Changyi sparked a revolution in the Altan world and was honored as the King of Fudan.
However, he did not want to be satisfied with this, but wanted to go further, to reach the mythic vanity, to shatter the void, to become a god. To do this, he visited numerous monuments, eventually entering the Black Blood Valley, and after many dangers found a mysterious tower.
And without disappointing him, the golden text appears on the tower, a no-win trick, called "Everlasting the Book of the Rising", practised to the highest degree, the body does not die, it is immortal, eternal with the heavens and the earth, and the sun and the moon.
But even if you train martial arts in an unruly, unhumanous world, it still feels that this inexhaustible book is difficult to understand, as if reading a book, and there is no head at all.
He tried to write this practice down and tried to learn it, but it was light-vibrant, it released an infinite divine light that shattered his body in an instant. But what was strange is that his soul did not dissipate but fell into a state of wakefulness, as a dream that lasted for tens of thousands of years.
For all these ten thousand years, his soul has been fumbling around in the immortal book and he can do nothing but this and at last after ten thousand years, he finally understood the first level of this law of merit.
What's the concept for a divine, powerful being taking ten thousand years to understand the first important level of a law of karma?
To know that the strong of heavenly condition in general will live for less than a thousand years, naturally, no one in the world can complete this perishable book, because before the beginning it has already died old.
Then, in a strange way, he gains control of the first level of the magic of the eternal deathless spirit and suddenly comes back to life, reincarnated in a sixteen year old boy of the same name.
But, no matter what happens, at least I'm alive.
Although this body is but the second layer of the body of the body, the waste material can not be used again, but I was once a heavenly and powerful, standing at the top of the martial arts, and the master of tango, the poor qualification with the drug to supplement the dan, do not believe that can not return to the top.
So, I finally mastered the book, which is a useless method, and even... probably not universal, but from a mythological world, otherwise how could it take ten thousand years to understand the first important method?
O my soul, I have overcome him that was before me, and I have come to the throne of God.
What happened to this body, who did not train to be a 2nd-tier gymnast until the age of 16, is it because martial arts is too boring nowadays?
Hmmm, countless memories are coming to mind that belong to another person, the first owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people are fused and inseparable from each other.
I see.
Ling Zhi nodded, and the reason why he is now in the second grade of the academy is because his spiritual roots were so poor.
If you want to become a martial artist, it is necessary to have a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, you can absorb the spirit of the universe and train yourself, turning it into your own energy.
Some of the spirit roots take in spirits quickly, others slowly, so the spirit roots are divided into four major grades, and each major level is divided into three small grades, with the best of the heavenly upper grade, and the lowest of the yellow-grade.
The key to judging the quality of the spirit root lies in the purity, the purer the better, while the cooler spirit root is the five rows combined, and most of all messy, in the martial arts world, this is the lowest ranking spirit root, and being considered a yellow-level underdog can only be said to be unwilling, so he is now sixteen years old but only to train the second level of fitness, while his peers have reached the fourth and fifth levels of fitness.
The former cold and winter life is the root of Heaven, and still the roots of the Ninja fire of the heavens are sophisticated, plus the talent of the dando that no man can reach, with the Dan Yuanwu, in just two hundred years, reached the state of heaven, which is the record of the ancient world.
It's no wonder that the previous body, despite its efforts, had only two layers of the body of the body repaired. For me, it is a bit tricky, but with the help of anti-aging medicine, I will definitely reach the peak again in up to four hundred years!
Whoa!
Ling chill in his heart, and his face revealed an unbelievable expression of shock, he stared for a moment, with a powerful soul power, looking back into the roots of his own Tang Chen, his expression of shock instantly turned into ecstasy.
Zhao Feng this is not five rows of hybrid spirit roots, five rows of perfect balance, forming a lotus. This is five rows of chaos lotus, po po po of the highest, is more rare than the Niang fire spirit root, can be called a divine spirit root.
And I... had a five-pointed star, matching five lines of the Chaos Lotus.
"For a hundred years, or fifty years, I may return to the kingdom of Heaven".
His spiritual practice of being in the heavenly realm before the winter of life was, he could not bear to reveal happiness, because he was destined to be here and there, and could not change that. In his previous life, he had visited countless monuments in order to break the void of becoming a god, and obtained a large number of techniques of yoga and magic, and the five levels of yoga are one of them.
In his previous life, he stood at the top of his martial arts, and in this life, he will create again, create immortal legends.
How did your ex die?
The cold weather stirred his memory, and he soon revealed an angry face.
The former is the only son of Ling family leader Ling Dong, mother and grandmother died a long time ago. Ling is a martial arts family, every clan practices martial arts and respects martial arts. What kind of person like Ling Dong can sit on the throne of the household?
He has been treated as waste material since he was a kid, and he was left with nowhere to go because of problems with his tongue.
In order to give her son a bright future, Ling Dong-Yi and Hua Yang College reached an agreement in which the school would recruit her as a student and develop her skills, and in exchange, Ling Dong-Yi would go to the Valley of the Sun in order to find something that Huyang lost a long time ago.
Hu Yang Academy was built by the Huyang Emperor, has many resources, and if it is fully developed, those who recycle materials can also be promoted to the state of polyamory.
The people at KC cannot be stupid, because if it is a good thing, then how can they offer such a good deal?
In Purple Valley, dangerous and heavy, any wrong step could be killed, but for the sake of his son, Ling Dong started unconsciously in seven days ago.
Yesterday, the Huang Academy came and informed the Ling family that today they would be accepted according to their contract. However, at this time, the grand vicar of the Ling family, the Liaoning, ran over and negotiated with his predecessor, asking him to give the precious title to his grandson Ling Muyuan.
The reason is that Ling Mu Nu is a genius, and the future is unlimited, such opportunities cannot be given to a waste material.
Of course, the ex would not answer. This was his father's chance to change his life! But Lin Xiangyuan said it was negotiation, actually just informing his ex, and did not take his opinion into account.
For the strong holdeth fast what is in his hand, and the strong man hath his whole strength in his hand; a finger can crush him, and he is a rival.
It's only one punch, but it will be badly wounded. He then locked himself in his room, apparently not wanting to embarrass himself in front of the people of Huangyang Academy. By the time Ling Dong turned, the tree was ready.
But the body that was heavily wounded was condemned to death.
Ling Xin screams, "What is so injurious, that this name, which his own father was exempted in exchange for his life, was taken away by Lin Weihe and Chen Xuan?"
This is a shameless couple!
I can't take it!
When he got up from the bed, he was startled; he thought he was alive, but his wounds were going to keep on growing.
A stroke to his forehead, and a blow to his genital organs caused damage, and this was a very troublesome thing, ordinary medicine was ineffective.
As far as I know, there are seven ointments that can repair ling root, but the four needed materials are too expensive, it would be to sell the whole Ling family or not replace the ling root and my ling root was only slightly damaged and did not need this kind of advanced ointment.
The remaining three types of potash, two of which need to be refined into tan, my current refinement of the second layer of the body is too sloppy. If only one opts for potassium starch rejuvenation, only need to adjust the pharmaceutical materials in proportion to, and boil it into a medicinal juice can be.
I was the first to heal the wound, then to stop the abuse against my son, I am not rare in that position, but I will never let my father's opportunity to trade his life for the loss of this couple of unfavorable sons!
He got down on his knees, sat down, and started working without stopping for days.
That was the first time he had been able to execute a divine power, but as it had been cultivated for thousands of years, it was now extremely submissive.
His life had suddenly been rebuilt and his strength was greatly reduced but he was able to recover quickly from his injuries.
A few minutes later, he was dead.
It is worth it to not destroy the book, I have just started practicing and I have so many surprising results. But this is completely different from other techniques, the normal technique is to use the root of the soul to transform the spirit of the universe into a force, not to destroy the book, it is just the opposite, to use the force to exercise the body, and to heal the wounds.
After training to the highest level of yoga, it is not impossible to become immortal. That is why yoga is called a book. It is a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I can repair the soul roots with the immortal book.
Ling opened his eyes and looked out at the whitening of the sky and said: "Ling, let's go and surprise that old man who has no face, and surprise him".
He put on his shoes, went to the door and opened it.
The door opened and a tall figure appeared to block the way, a man named Zhang Wang, one of the big and tall walking dogs.
The chief inspector said, You have to stay in the room today! The old man made a joke, even though he is the son of the housewife, he is a famous piece of scum and he is a joke in his eyes.
Then cold as ice, he said, "Can you stop me?"
You are the one who stopped it, the governor said. We should not let Lin Chong go today, and if necessary we should do something about it too. Zhang Yuan smiled without laughing: "Well, this is the order of the Governor, and please do not give me trouble about the governor.
The old dog, Liang Yifan, was cautious and thoughtless about his injuries. He sent guards to guard the door. This shows how important it was for Liang Yifan to get his grandson into the Huangyang Academy. But when this hope was ruined, he felt disappointed and frustrated.
Go away, run along in the cold and cold way.
Whoa!
Raising hands in the cold is a sign of coldness, cold and cold: "What are you that you don't roll?"
What, he was struck in the hand by a piece of scum? Zhang Zhang could not believe that he touched his own face, that the scum dared to attack him, and also hit him, what kind of joke is this?
Whoa!
He shook his hand again, and gave him a firm kiss.
What? What?
The sound of an acoustic sheep echoes through the silence of the hills.
He climbed the mountain, the night wind was still fast and cold, but at this moment he was sweating with anxiety. He was thirteen years old, and climbed up the hill with hands and feet, and the night was particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night looks terrible, Lee Seon-Nai's soul is still burning inside.
Born in a family of poor peasants, Lee started herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Sat kept sheep as usual, but when he returned in the evening to the sheep, he found that there was one lamb missing, and this made him very nervous. He hurried back to the mountain to look for it, but he turned around the whole mountain and did not find the lamb.
Thinking of the cruel man of Zhang Dahui, who had lost a sheep, Li spent the night terrified and scared.
And when the whole hill had been searched for, and there was no shadow of the goat, at this time Li thought of one place, the only place that did not search for the Cave of the Great Spirit!
To look up at the night color of the valley in front, like a rampaging beast, with his mouth wide open and always looking at people, and the hidden voice of the wolf crying in his ears, looking forward to the night color of the lost cave of the fairy tale, Lee couldn't stop beating a drum the night before.
The Cave of the Damned is a place of local infamy and legend has it that a demon dwells in it, whoever enters it is devoured, and after entering, no one ever comes out alive.
But at this time, the sound of Zhang Dahu's leather whip echoing in Li's ear, he lost a goat and Zhang Dahu would have to suck his skin and kill him!
Well, well, well, this eternal, immortal, dark world is finally finished, all that is lacking is the soul, today is your soul! You do not know how long, the Demon Cave echoed a deep and deep voice.
Soon a sudden flap of wings was heard, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of the cave of the Goth.
Fly, fly, fly! the city will remember the grave with your soul, fly over the land, as long as the nine worlds still are, this place must be found! In the cave of the dark devil of the night, the dark depths of the voice echoed.
Then, there was a great twilight flying between heaven and earth, going into the burial, into the city of the Fairies, through the realm of the dead... flying over all the nine realms of existence, suffering all kinds of tortures and not dying for thousands of years.
Time passes, the times change, one invincible figure rises and another falls. Slowly but surely, at some point a mysterious raven begins to appear, a mysterious crow escapes from the confinement, and begins to search for a way to control his own fate.
From the medicine god, to the Fire god, to the blood dragon god, to the Myo-ryu god, to the Toon-jun god, to the Ice-feather god... and finally to the Dragon King.
One generation of invincible giants rises, another generation of gods falls away; but through millions of years the Raven remains hidden in the river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and the snow was flying.
A few minutes later, I saw myself sitting on a yellow and gray chariot, with the carriage swaying, a little girl talking and whispering to me.
Outside the car, there was a buzzing sound of people shouting, shouting, shouting and cheering.
Lu Xing sighed deeply.
He knew he was never coming back, from an old oilman who had died in a state enterprise, after one drink, he awakened to the world
It has been five days so far.
He sniffed his nose; there was the smell of wine, cake, and fried fruit.
Oh, the white beer in the cafeteria is getting smarter and smarter. The small but loud voice of the maid in the cab.
With the face of a doll, he has a small head. His look is just like a 10-year-old boy.
He is dressed in a green cotton suit, and has the hair to tie when he is about to get out of the car.
The hair rope is made from an expensive type of tree bark and has a faint fragrance, but the only drawback is that it becomes rigid with the cold, and needs to be heat treated.
She smiled and said nothing. The carriage soon stopped.
He got out of his car and onto a gray and white streets, he laid out one piece of asphalt, each the size of a facebowl.
There are many people going back and forth in the street. People are riding their horses back and forth. The girls and women who are selling the goods, their faces exposed and laughing, have no qualms about it.
Rujong looked up at the wine cellar in front of him. The white sign was rectangular with a dragonfly dance in the middle with three large letters: Rujong.
Enter the kitchen! The room numbered A is reserved for you! A little girl greets us with a smile.
The streets end a little bit, a couple of rich boys do a party, from around the little hand took over a silver-sided white paper window, slightly glanced, the window is open, painted on the top of a mountain water smoke wave pattern, the mountain water up and down, dark overlap, and there is a view is the title of everyone's style ▽
He was riding in a light car along with his younger brother, and entered the wine cellar.
The bar is divided into two levels, the first floor hall is filled with people listening to singing.
A girl dressed in green and crisp standing in the void, her voice distorted, beside her a middle-aged woman playing a tambourine.
The song is about the love between an expatriate general and a mountain fox.
The audience of the bar is very rude, and only a few educated men can understand, while the rest of the people have turned a blind eye to the two girls.
Lu Xing stopped to look at the first floor, looking so enthusiastically, he also sought an empty place to sit on the first floor.
Who will be the third? He asked with a sigh.
In this place of entertainment, his position varies, and if this place is the equivalent of a high-end club on earth, then he is the supreme VIP.
This expense is already counted as a top customer in a small northern city like Kyushu.
You are the man of the hour.
So they took him and let him go.
He took a seat, and glanced around in the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale, thin boy, dressed in a white coat, and with a golden handbag-holster in his hand, fluttering slightly.
I suppose she could be the one who had seen the little girl singing the song.
The last time that big brother warned him he was a bad guy! the small brother frowned.
He laughed and stopped talking. He started listening to the music.
A table of wine quickly appeared on the dark red wooden table, and Ryoung grabbed a piece of meat and put it in his mouth.
A taste of a white beer, as with a drink. The gentle sweet and floral fragrance, mixed together, is as with drinking a fruit juice.
In this snow city, the sea ice is a specialty; from the thick ice caves you can pick any type, and a lot of tiny translucent bodies can emerge.
The ice cream is half the size of the normal one, but delicious.
Of course, the price is very expensive.
It's a luxury to eat once a month, where are some who eat like him.
when they eat the delicacies and drink the good wine, and listen to a little child singing in the streets, but their mind is on other things?
After coming to this ancient world like China for so many days. But according to his own observation, there are many oddities in this world.
At first he thought he was back to antiquity, but then he found out he wasn't.
The customs, and the festive atmosphere are very different from any other dynastic region he had known.
After thinking about it, the wine cellar door opened again.
A line of men in short trousers came in and found an easy seat at a table near the corner.
At first sight these brave men are not locals, their dress more like those from the central region of China, and their attire more like that of the coarse-skinned from the north.
It was a strong man, a bald head, with a copper earring, with a face full of flesh, but he gasped a sigh.
What does Yang Chao care, Li family cannot go through the village, we can take the second road, and we can also circle the village from Zhang   another Han boy  .
You know what, when I came to meet you, I walked through Zhang Village. The situation is almost like that of Lee's village, many people have died.
What's the matter with you, big brother? You said to tell the brothers to listen, but we have to meet. Well a guy urged me on.
He sighs again. I don't know how exactly, but a few fishing villages on the shore of the Yangtze have been affected, as if there is a water ghost.
That's right.
The table on the right is not far from them, and you can hear them talking unconcealed.
He was listening to them and did not realize that they were talking about religious matters.
His family, who numbered one or two in this city of the North, is one of the richest families in Van Zhen.
In comparison to the world, this is at least the richest billion-dollar person in the world.
During these days of drinking, he also overhears in the pub a lot of rumors about demons and ghosts, but most of them are legends.
This is the first time I have experienced something like this, so I will listen to it carefully.
The people were also very good at hiding things. Keep talking about the strange things in the fishing village.
And now this water demon of mine, I saw with my own eyes, tall and tall, with green teeth, dressed in many water grass, and if it were not for your elder brother, I would have run faster, and now you wouldn't want to see me.
Brother, is there a water spirit in this game? A fellow doesn't believe that.
Big Brother is a story you made up, isn't he?
When Lu Xue heard about this place, he felt amused, and thought it was just a boast of some other fanatical person who had just walked through the front door.
And after the king had eaten and drunk, he sent his servant to fetch the record of the girls and to look through it.
It is said that the three will play nice but not in the right way, so he intends to replace it with a happy one.
Whoa!
But at that moment, the bald man blushed and slapped the table.
The ghost is a bone that fell to the earth! This is what I stole and brought back!
He took out a green stone like a jade from his arms and placed it on the table.
This is a piece of junk! one of the guys laughed.
What is this?
Brother Yang, can you show me this toy?
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the other side.
Several people with smiles stood in front of the table, their eyes sweeping over the green stones on the table.
You say, "What do you want? This is what the demons have left". The man was very amazed.
He is the one who is now taking out the show and he's just going to throw it away.
After all, this is not a game left to man. If you really brought a water demon to get into trouble, it is worth losing.
I looked at the water ghost, and I could not believe it, but I saw how good the gem looked like it sold, not like the average gem.
To know that the general jade, can be bought anywhere in the shops, it is the edge of the jade which is grinding up, the price is very cheap.
Somehow, when he saw the jewel, he felt that something was wrong.
A white fox in a blue robe with a green-jeweler's hat on his head, and black boots with silver threads.
A single dress could be used for months in the garden, and even a year in the average household.
The poor boy will or may not, but... one or two silver pieces!
Lu Xun let the kid find one or two pieces of silver and put them on the table.
The chief decided to pick up the jewel and go on his way, one step ahead. Then several of them exchanged glances and got up and went on their way.
And Lucifer said nothing, but sent out, and took the stone in his hand, and picked it up, and saw that it was good.
He shakes his head, one or two silver does not mean anything to him, according to the memory of this body, his month's expenses during the week day are at least two hundred silver. Occasionally more, it may even cost more than two thousand.
When he thought of this, he was lost.
Without bothering to look round at the enthusiastic guests, with his gem in hand, he left the cellar on foot and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But as soon as he had gone out of the wine-press, not being half way, he suddenly felt sick, and took a jasper, and put it on his heart.
And the stone was in his hand, and was in the palm of his right hand, and melted.
The original hard rock, in just a few seconds, turned into a dark green slime, which crept up, and a grief was heard.
All the mucus broke suddenly and turned into a cloud of green smoke, which slowly dissipated in front of the road.
He stood in fear, stared at the ground, and saw that the gem was still in his hand, but the green in it had disappeared, though the time was not known.
He was standing there, and for a moment the previous image had been in his memory.
The little boy kept calling out to him.
The path is better than the return of God, the stone in your hand is just a common ruby stone, not even a gemstone.
You go, back to your home!
The two of them got into the carriage, and the driver took a whip and smoked a few times as two black, long-haired horses began to slowly move.
In the car, Roo was silent, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hand.
She was again cheated! The old woman shook her head and said, "Well, the great prince is fine this time. Last time, his biggest betrayal was the so-called antique wine cellar, which cost him ten thousand and two silver coins. He almost killed the old man. But this time it was just one or two silver coins, and the younger one sometimes ate more than this.
When he was getting to the city gate, he heard a noise outside the gate.
I had heard that the water devil has been removed! A tour guide helped solve the problem of a fishing village!
Is anyone going to the royal court?
Wu came early, heard that even Oiyong, the head of the government in Xiamen, almost fell into the trap. It was good to meet a man named Liang, it was said that as soon as the man went out, it was a flash of golden light, the Water Ghost shouted when he was in the warehouse, turned into a green mercury, and then exploded into a huge smoke. Wu
Of course not!
He heard the officers, who were guarding the city gate, talking among themselves.
He used to pass deliberately by this gate, where the centurion kept the news of the soldiers, and the latter liked to gloat about strange things.
What a coincidence... the road is better than the facial expression
When he remembered the stone, he was troubled.
In the autumn of 9999 according to the Shinzō Chronology, East Sea, Qingzhou City
The Qingzhou School Palace, Qingzhou City Hall and Qingzhou City House of Nobles and more than half of the powerful members of the Zhongming family have left the Qingzhou School Palace. Therefore, all people in Qingzhou City are proud to be able to study in the academy, and if there is an opportunity to enter the academy, they must strive to learn.
However, it seems not everybody is aware of this. Meanwhile, a young student has fallen asleep on a table in one of the classrooms in a school in Qingzhou.
The blue-robed girls over at the top of the lecture hall noticed the scene as well, but without showing any anger, they walked towards the sleeping boy.
Boyi, 17 years old, a student of the Qingdao School, an outdoor student and teacher, beautiful face and body, fire-fighting. In the classroom, a pair of eyes move with Boyi's animated figure, even if it is angry, Boyi's step is still graceful.
The guy sleeps in the classroom again. He seems to have noticed that, and the younger guys are speechless, so of course this is not the first time.
With a body and a figure so attractive to me that I only need to look at her, what in the world did he have in mind?
Of all the lecturers, Bowie was by far the most popular, and none of them were so popular that, for the reason that many regarded her as a goddess, one could understand by seeing her that her lecture halls were always full to overflowing.
Booi moved slowly, and made no sound when she came up to the boy; but she stood before the table, and stared at the sleeping face in front of her, her beauty filled with a cold.
A soft voice came, but it was not from her mouth, but from behind her.
It seemed in her sleep that she heard someone calling to her, and Ye Wo Tian's body moved, his hands clasped together to his head, and his eyes opened in ease.
There was a big, loud whisper, and his voice was light as if talking to himself, but in the silence of the moment it was still very odd; for just one moment, many glances were fixed in the air, and then turned into anger.
How dare he... openly belittle the teacher?
A series of angry glances, like a sharp sword, which made Ye Wo-Shin shake with a cold snap, as if feeling bad, moved his gaze upward across the seductive region, and then he saw a face as delicate as jade, but full of fury.
The cheeks... The black lines on my face. What is Ai?
When he turned around, there was a clean girl, fifteen years old, looking at him with angry eyes.
Ye Wo Sun glanced at the girl, then shouted at the other, it was a disaster, no wonder the size is not right.
Teacher, I...I just wanted to explain.
Wu Yi's indifference interrupted him, "What was the background of the founding of the Qing Academy?"
It was clear that Boei was trying to avoid the embarrassment of the earlier conversation, but Ye Vo Tian could clearly feel her rage at that moment, and he even felt a sharp sting coming from his body and piercing every inch of his skin.
Three hundred years ago, when Emperor Dongzong united Eastern Xinjiang and ordered the kings to set up the Wu Fu Academy and the Shenzhen Martial Arts Academy, the Qingzhou Academy was founded in this context. Feng Yue-Wien responded that, of course, what he was saying was recorded in the history of Zheng He, and there was another name in the wild history he had seen in the family, but, however, the name forbidden was never allowed to be mentioned.
What are the professions of practicing yoga?
The practice of Zen can be divided into martial arts and martial arts, there are many professions such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen, and practitioners of the Zen have many professions such as lawmasters, dan masters, and alchemists, and the lawmasters are divided into many branches, and of course there are also gifted non-practitioners of both martial arts and martial arts.
You seem to be missing a career.
A divine light shone on his face: the strongest profession recognized by the state of Wuling, the one who gained divine guidance, the destiny magician, the one with the gifts of the gods, those who have rare talents, such as the evangelist, the astrologer, and the astrologer, the vast majority of them came from the destiny magicians, the destiny magician, regardless of martial arts, can have a more powerful gift than others.
The surrounding people all are looking for God, the magus, legendary professions, inheritors of fate, and get affection. Not only that, even the magus of fate is suitable for martial law and shūji.
He then looked at the teenager with some anger in the eyes saying: "I didn't think you knew that much".
Yue Wen looked at Yue and said seriously: "I am a fortune teller".
And so it was, and then, a short distance away a young man was drinking water, coughing heavily and staring at Ye Wo Tian like an idiot.
What is this brazen, brazen man who is a legend in the Qingdao school, who not only openly mocks the teacher, but now also lies about his being a fortune teller, in order to attract the attention of the teacher?
Yet what kind of person is he who, after three years of practice in the Academy, has always been awake in the first phase, with the state of a breathless body, weak and obvious, without any completion of his physical development, so insignificant and even as waste of wood, and who calls himself the diviner of destiny?
Bo Yi's chest began to grow, and she looked at Yao Wo Shi with anger. She said, "Well, since you are a divine judge and the House of Nature has a soul, let me see the soul of your House of Life".
I could not wake up from my sleep, my soul is still asleep and I have fallen asleep in the pulpit because of my soul.
Wu Yue Wo Tian... Wu Yi suddenly cried out, Wu Zhou stared at his friend who was dead, "Step up three years ago, when you entered the school at 12, when I was a foreign student, I visited your talent test, you were a gift for feeling the inspiration, shocking the school, and many teachers paid attention, yet after three years, no progress, stayed awake at the first concentration, nothing to do at the end of the day, laziness, distracted from teaching, haven't you practiced? "
You've refused all the entrance exams for the past three years, whether it is Spring or Autumn, and you came to the first place, didn't you have any shame?
As soon as she saw her angry look, the whole school became quiet and the eyes of the students stared at her emotionally, as if this was the first time they had ever seen her.
Ye Wo-ting seemed to have been stopped as well, the dark monkeys stared at the exquisite expression of the face that was red with anger.
Three years?  叶伏天 whispered to himself, it is not thought, it has been three years, and the guy in the castle is still not changed, and he is somewhat unexpected, the ever-indifferent ice mountain sensuality Goddess Suzhou, it turns out has always been paying attention to him, since the year he entered the palace to detect the gift of perception has already begun.
The space was silent, Liu Iming stared at a young man, a handsome face with clear lines, clean deep eyes with bright stars, fifteen years old, apart from his lean body, he could not pick out other shortcomings, in another three or two years, he must be a beautiful man.
Was my voice too heavy? When Ye Wook-hwan saw that his eyes had dropped a few drops of bitterness, he could not hide it in his heart, and his anger also dissipated for a while.
You have one month to take the autumn exam, and if you still give up or fail this time, even if you don't feel sorry for you in the rest of your life, the Academy will not allow you to stay. Don't you understand?
If this is the case, it is unlikely that it will be included in the history of the Qingzhou school palace, and after all, it is very rare to be expelled by the Qingzhou school.
Let him go, let me go. At the end of the passage a faint voice came, and many looked at the young man in the corner, whose eyes were intricate, with envy and jealousy, and with worship and fear.
The decision has been made in the Yuan Academy that the rest of his life does not need to participate in next year's spring ceremony, but can freely choose to train in the Palace of War, the Order of Knights, and the Falun Gong Palace, so his future can no longer be bored by you. Yang Yu looked at Yevo with a sigh, and he and the rest of their lives are destined to go in completely different directions.
The video shows a slight smile on the tip of Ye Wo's tongue, and a sceptical tone.
The mother stood up and sat at the back for the rest of her life, and her eyes pierced with the sharp light of the mother, piercing the child.
Liu Yiwuqian did not look back, spoke softly, and for the rest of his life his eyes stopped, looking at the shadows before and behind. Then he sat down quietly, as if the words of Yuan Yueqian were iron orders to him.
I decided to.............Volan showed a slightly frantic smile and said, "You are officially taking this year's Autumn Grand Entrance Test".
After this, a bright light flashed through the tears of the rest of my life.
Three years, and he's finally taking it seriously?
After practicing three years at the Academy of Qingzhou, all the people in the Academy only knew that he had a great talent for the rest of his life, that he had a gift of perception of the gold system, a gift of martial arts, a martial arts master, and a teacher, although he was a student of outer doors, his level was higher than that of many instructors.
However, who really knows the sleeping boy?
Your body is weak and you still stay in the state of waking up the first resurrection, how can you survive even if you participate in the autumnal examination? Ye Yui looks at Ye Oui and sighs in his heart, even if you wake up now, it may still be late.
What if that was all over? He seems a little less self-conscious and has a strong confidence in his tone.
If you can, do whatever you want to do in the class after your lecture.
Ye Vo's eyes flashed with a strange light, looking at the shadow and the body of the torch before him, his eyes did not look where they should not have looked, weak and weak: Do you want to do anything?
Hey guy what does this mean... a lot of people are staring at Ye Wo Sun
This shameless bastard, where do you put your eyes? He seemed to notice the look in Yi Wo's eyes, many people have the impulse to go wild, he is also dare to joke with Master's sister.
Yui naturally noticed Ye Wo Tian's eyes, and the compassionate heart that had just been born suddenly vanished, and the beautiful and vicious person stared at Ye Wo Tian, biting her teeth, and said, "You can do whatever you want!"
Deep in the mountains, all the demons are gathered.
For the first time, all the tribes discarded their resentments and emerged at the same time, the tiger and the fox and the snake... all kinds of demons gathered. For a time, the whole forest was the sound of various demons, big or small, or small or feeble or fairy. Moreover, the ten demon king, the topmost powerful of the ten demon realm, sat on top, and the same heavy atmosphere appeared in front of the temple.
Oh my fellow Elves, what has happened recently, I guess there are some of you. The Tiger clan has always been strong, and the first thing the Tiger King said was to calm down the demons. Hey we are fellow demons, and under such a crisis, I think that all ethnic groups should set aside prejudices and unite, to solve the problems in the present.
What is the purpose of the pump?
Did he do this to us by guessing? The King said in a cold voice, "Who else could have done it, except the three monks of the six orders? Have we not seen fewer demons slaughtered by the King of the Tigers during these years?"
But we, along with the monks, have been at odds ever since, why they have suddenly blocked our way out of the world. The Fox King is in doubt.
The dragon did not eat the first of their three six species. The snake king also guessed the way, that they did not have to tear their faces like this.
That is so! So, the King of the Furies is very upset, so many years have passed, so what devils hasn't eaten a human, so how come three or six groups suddenly suffered? I don't think it was them.
Yeah, everyone knows that our demons are bad for them, so they never go anywhere near the border forest, and how can they be specialists here?
But... besides the three of the six, who is strong enough to kill all the demons that are out there in three months.
The Dragon King nodded as if he were remembering something, his feathers were all wrinkled, and then I heard that the demons, the ones that came out of the realm, each of them died dead, without bones, and those who were skinned were zombie, on the old trees in the forest, were corpses dried by the wind.
I just deceived them so well. The king of the tiger of the tigers crushed the handle of the stone chair with one hand and rose up in rage. Dear kings of the demons, I think it is better to kill them together to find out who is at the bottom of this guessing. I don't believe that they can build up higher than this and that they can hold back this huge army of demons.
When he said that, the other nine demon lords immediately showed an expression of approval, and in fact, rather than being afraid, they were ready to strike.
The first answer of the Deer King was, "My son should die in their hands; rather than speculate here, it would be better to go out and kill them". How about the three Six Sect, when did we demons fear them!
Is it not for this that we are gathered together today? Whoever it was, let him go out and take vengeance on his fellow men who were killed. Even the least brave of the Yangs raised his voice in response, but the Yangs died the most.
That's right, this is not revenge, but the devil!
The spirit of the people of the Shan is upon us, and we swear vengeance.
And the rest of the demons rose up in response, and the demons of all tribes, and peoples, and nations, came all round, and came in all their shapes, and in their bright claws, and in their shrill cry for vengeance, and came forth, as a whole host.
A small voice suddenly rang out in the crowd, and I didn't feel the need to leave.
In the midst of the crowd's raging fury, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared which, though not loud, succeeded in attracting the attention of the demons. The shouting stopped, and all of the demons' eyes turned toward the thorn in the side.
Who is the tiger? The tiger king is more like the tiger looking for this undead beast.
Demons searched everywhere, the sharpest of the five senses, but after half a day of searching, they still didn't find the person who was talking to them.
Who is it that spoke to you? The tiger king was in a fever, where did the devil come from? There is a kind of one standing out to him.
I am here, here!
They looked around again, and again, but did not see the man who had spoken.
Here and there...oh that sound comes on, left left, not right, right...over, over, a little to the right, wrong, look here, look at this.
They looked around for a while to see who was speaking to them, but they did not find anyone.
Oh, here I am!
And there was a voice, and a spirit of death ascended upon the seat of the chief of them that were sent forth by him. And they saw the man with the voice.
It was a woman with a gray robe, her shoulders couldn't move, her eyes were moving, all the people had a sort of a seaside temperament, her figure was short and thin, her face was yellow with a tinge of turkey.
And there appeared at once a word in the demon's mind, and was weak, and faint, and even the spirit of the demon was weak and pitiful, and could blow her away, as if a spirit had blown from the atmosphere.
It is no wonder the demons searched for him for half a day, and still couldn't find him, such a demon is really very unusual.
The blood-stained tiger king was unable to see through it, the tiger's nose sprayed, the way of a shark, oh, you're a child without seeds, several monks in the ward have frightened you, and made you this way. Oh, demons can all take forms, but this is an all-demon convention, so most of the elves here reveal the point prototype to distinguish the race, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the tiger king even more invisible, oh dare to show a prototype, what kind of demon are you? Oh wow I'm human
"I am a human being".
What demon is the dragon? The Tiger King asked, "What dragon demon? I have never heard of it!"
What kind of a mess and weak little demonic species dare to come to the all-demon assembly. The Tiger King looked at the woman with indignation, "You idiot, you can rest in this nonsense, affect my morale to take revenge".
Oh no, I'm serious. You have a woman who unconsciously raises her arms and shoulders, and doesn't notice it; you look weaker, but you don't have to go out and get revenge on someone.
The Tiger King was angry and shouted, "I don't think I ate your little demon!"
You ate me, you don't have to run around.
What do you mean?
"I mean, the fellow you were just talking about, the one who kills demons and birds... Oh!" she sighed, and she patted the grey robe up, still looking so unimpressed, and then she pointed to her nose, "Oh maybe... it's me!
The entire scene was silent for three seconds, and the birds were silent.
I killed her!
The demon, who had been reacting, turned back towards the woman.
Little animals are such a pain!
Five minutes later
The first and last session of the Conference is over!
Chapter One: What about Don?
The huge noise stimulates the nerves of the brain, and the loudest can be deafening. A stinging white light is injected into the tears, the sun [throttling] the pain.
He then opened his eyes, but the light did not fade, rather it spread all over the world.
What the fuck is going on, am I standing on a rock concert?
Down in his heart cursed eyes wide and opened, and a large, frightening face streamed into his tears. The sweating black face, and the heat of the two black holes under the wide nostrils seemed to have spilled out on his face. The white teeth in the gaping mouth were as fearsome as the wild animals, and of course there was the smell of the mouth.
Then came a violent and positive blow. Don felt as if he had been punched in the jaw by a heavy punch, and the body fell backwards.
The weight of the two men was on those poor plastic bottles, and they broke loose. The water from the white flowers came out, and even a column of water sprayed from the mouth of one of the bottles directly on the face of the ponds behind, the other ponds like terrified sparrows.
Holy shit!
He is a devil!
What is this?
The team doctor, the team doctor!
How did you get mad?
Downs lay on the floor, staring intently at the strange faces around him, some of them anxious, some of them wounded, and some of them smiling. The noise was still there, but the noise had changed to the hum of howling and laughter.
Where are they? Who are they? What's going on?
But wait, let's see what happened on the sideline? the commentator from the live commentary suddenly became excited, he stood up and looked down from the rooftop viewing platform, the main striker of the Oak Forest team, David Johnson, was smashed against the coach's seat in a tussle with the other players, and poor Tony Don, coach, was standing on the sideline to direct the game... wow! look at the misery on the ground, this was a real Mars-to-Earth crash!
Donne was lying on the floor, his light grey suits already wet, his mouth bubbling with grass and dirt, looking like a freshly used cloth.
A man with a big nose and a long black beard, somewhat like Mario, appeared in his field of vision, as he jerked a white glove from a fur sack he was carrying and began to examine Dunn's body.
Hell, he looks like he's back on the ground!
Can you hear me? He extended his hand in front of Don and frowned, his voice more anxious than before.
A picture of the same scene is played over and over again on the TV screen.
After a heated fight with No. 14, Johnsen received a powerful push from the opposing team, and the big black slouched down toward Donne, who was standing near the edge of the field, but strangely enough, Donne had plenty of time to avoid being tackled and stood on the sidelines as if he were a puppet, and watched his teammates tearfully slam into him.
The Forest players were anxiously gathered at the coach's side, and Don was naturally at the centre of the crowd, with the wrong-headed striker David Johnson kneeling on the ground, and praying. If his coach had a pen, he would be the first player to kill his own coach on the field.
In contrast to the nervousness of the forest team players, whose opponents are mostly standing inside and holding each other, there are also those curious people who take on the duties of the whole squad's scout, running all the time to see the fans and then running back to share the situation with their teammates in the crowd.
Forest fans in the stands did not seem to be concerned about the life of their head coach, but instead took the opportunity to shout their displeasure at their teams' poor performances, with words starting with "F" or "S" pouring out of their mouths, as well as countless high-picking middle fingers, and even a big screen shot showing 0:2 with extra sharp eyes.
Forest's team doctor Gary Fleming was still doing his best, but he had just seen Tony's eyeballs move a bit, so why did he not react?
He slapped Tony Donen on the face without any response. The team's acting coach lay on the ground like a statue, his mouth open and eyes wide, as if he had seen something amazing.
The blue sky, the white clouds like cotton candy, the faces of different colors and expressions, the noisy atmosphere, all this is familiar and yet strange, as if thousands of miles away from you.
The referee showed that the team doctor was looking at the process himself and that he could not have the match suspended indefinitely because of the off-field injuries. He whistled for the players to return to the field, and the game would continue, even though the Forest players had already given up.
Fleming, furious at the referee's indifference, pointed to the tunnel of the Downing Judge, which is still lying on the ground.
Then you just called an ambulance, I was just the referee! The referee kept his head back, and he didn't seem as dangerous as you said. He pointed to Fleming behind him and then ran back to the field.
And then he turned back, and he saw Don getting up, and he went over to help him. "How are you feeling, Tony?" he whispered.
Don's mumbled answer: "Where is this?"
Fleming turned around and said something nasty, and I thought, this time has just gone terribly wrong. ̋ Deeds, Deeds, you're coming! ̋ He motioned for a golden man to come over to the coaching seat.
The man called Jade Run came running over. What about Tony?
It is so bad. He just asked me where it is.
His response was similar to Fleming's earlier, and he twisted his head and said a dirty word.
I think that he just fell and suffered damage to the back of his skull as a result of the impact.
Is the situation bad, Gary? Jan Dees bites her lips and frowns.
Oh, I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad. Oh, Fleming shook his head.
What does that mean?
The good news is he has temporary memory loss and rest will ease it. The bad news...do you need me to say anything more?
Des waved his hand, and signaled that he understood. "You took him to the hospital? But the game is still in progress now, and we are behind, and you need him to direct the game"... He said as he turned to look at Tony Dunne, next to him, but he was surprised to see Dunne walking toward his player slowly and alone.
Oh! Baldur hurried to throw Fleming to the floor, ran up and grabbed his colleague.
Tony, where are you going? the effect of the screaming at desjanges in a noisy environment is really just a whisper!
Down looked back at him coldly and coldly, with the golden light of the rising sun now shining on their heads, but he could not see anything in the pair of eyes.
Tony, where are you going?
So I... I don't know, maybe... going home... to Donald Dunne and wanting to shake Dodds hand.
Fleming came running in from the other side: "Tony, you can't go home now. We are playing a game, you are the head coach, you have to direct the team!
The three men's drag of the passing lane brought up the attention of the two substitutes, as well as the attention of the stands, even the players on the field, who glanced at it from time to time.
Donne laughed suddenly, "Am I a coach? Well that's ridiculous, how can I be a coach... I'm a fan and play football manager games all the time, but how could I be a coach?
As the two people present themselves for the first time, Fleming says: "He was an English international, a central defender, who retired from the team last year, and now he is your colleague, your assistant".
Don nodded, then said to Des: OK, now that you're in charge of the game for me, I need to take a break. After saying that, Des's hands, no longer aware of the great whistling and two blinking men behind him, entered the passageway.
Fleming looked at Dawn's back, then at Des' and Walker.
He took a deep breath, turned and walked back.
Downs was sitting in the hallway with his back to the wall, looking at his surroundings. On his brightly coloured wall was a huge sign, under which the red roofs were three undulating lines, and below was an English word: Forest.
Where am I? What is going on?
Don touched the back of his head, where the pain was hidden.
* Steal the old man, hit him in the back!
"What do you call me?" he mumbled, but then suddenly stopped his mouth. He had been speaking in a bird's voice and English until then.
Shit, how did this happen?
When Dunne finally found out where he was, he stopped again, so much so that his brain stopped responding after calculating the load. And all of it seemed to have been nothing to do with him anymore.
The incident was witnessed at the City Stadium this afternoon when Forest's interim head coach Tony Downs stood on the sidelines when he was knocked down by one of his teammates, then seemed to collapse into a brief coma. When he woke up, he stepped directly into the players' passageway.
In a faint glow from the streetlights outside, Donnie stood in the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror: a middle-aged ghost with a raised nose, deep eyes, blue eyeballs, and a slightly bent orange head.
Don, who is actually from Sichuan, China, was only 26 years old, and had even raised eyebrows in the picture! 34 years old!
Not only did he mysteriously sink into an Englishman, but he went on for four years and three months!
Although he never felt that he was tall enough, he was able to attract the attention of many girls.
He plunged at the mirror and smashed it with his fist. The image of himself in the mirror became numerous, the pieces fell to the ground in a whirring sound, and numerous faces looked down on Donne as if they were laughing at him.
Donny felt a little embarrassed and took a step back, leaning against the smooth wall, breathing hard.
After a few minutes of silence in darkness, Dunn gradually came to his senses. He decided not to think about such a complicated issue. He had a habit in China of looking for a place to drink when things didn't go his way.
Looking up at the cloudy sky outside, he went out the door wearing a thick coat of wind.
Forest's recent season was unfortunate as the team lost 3-0 at the home of the weaker Wolves. A high hopeful, Paul Hart did not perform well for the team, he submitted his resignation to team President Nigel Dougherty after the last round, and it was quickly accepted.
A television screen mounted on a rack is playing today's sports news, focusing on everything that happens naturally near the Nottingham Forest Stadium.
A noise was heard in the noisy bar.
A drunk big man raised his middle finger to the TV. "Oh that Tony Don I know him! The little haired kid who used to help Paul Hart in the youth team".
Don had just finished his long speech when he opened the door. The sound of the door drew the attention of most of the men in the bar drinking and talking, and they cast eyes toward the door, first with surprise, then with a cynical smile on their faces, when they saw who had just entered.
A typical British middle-aged man stood up with a glass of wine and yelled, "Hey, Coach Tony Dunn!"
A whistle of applause came from the mouths of people inside the bar.
The middle-aged man held up his wine glass to a glass of wine, and the people around him immediately joined the chorus and raised their wine glasses.
Then another man, clearly intoxicated, stood up and walked over to Dawn with a beer bottle at her mouth, banged a bell and said "Coach Anthony Dawn, it was a good defense, but the referee and the public obviously didn't... didn't think so... wow!"
After he said that, he turned his head to the other people in the bar and laughed:
So he moved his face with a sulky face, pushed the bottle of wine that was in front of him. Then he went straight to the bar, and said to the bartender inside: Please bring the bottle... He is accustomed to saying bottle two or two small bottles two cans, though Sichuan, but he's the university in the north, since that time I like the strong drink, but he does not speak English very well, more importantly, he was quick to respond that this is in England, not in China.
When the others who had been watching him with him heard this they shouted, "He has asked for some wine".
Wow, did that coward Tony drink too?
The young butler faced these excited guests, who had no idea who the other was, and wanted to get some wine, but he was stopped by the demons that called out, "Joe, give him some fruit juice! juice! juice! juice! juice!"
No, no, milk, we have fresh milk!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The owner of the bar, startled by the noise outside, came down the staircase and saw almost all the people who had not slept at the tables around the front of the bar, and a man in a black windbreaker in the middle, mocked and ridiculed by those who had been drinking.
The people in the bar were silenced by the sound of his voice. All the drunkards, who had been drinking before, were silenced when they saw the man who had been standing behind them.
Dawn was astonished to see someone who could break a crowd of people down with a single word. He looked around and saw a man emerging from the shadows of the staircase.
The young bartender pointed to Don and said, "Hey boss, he wants a shot".
When the crowd saw him, they were astonished and said, "He is the one who was sitting and eating".
What a joke.....but they do not make it difficult for the bartender to see the drunks who have returned to their seats.
This man looked around the bar, but no one he saw lowered their heads, either pretending to be asleep or with their heads down making people drink. Donne became increasingly interested in the well-mannered middle-aged man in front of him.
I see no objections, pour him a glass of Scotch whisky on my behalf. The owner of the bar looks at Dawn and asks, "One or two?"
The drunkards were laughing at the sight of the hot potatoes.
The bartender laughed too,  Oh I forgot who you are... He poured half a golden whisky into the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then offered it to Dawn: This is the wine from my hometown
Don took a sip and coughed right away, since he rarely drinks gin. Besides this pure Scotch whisky also has a pungent, hard coke taste.
There was a lot of laughter in the bar.
Don Don, the Tony I know, never drinks and used to be like a real traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me that way now, don't you know who I am?
And he had to find a way to hide himself. Oh well, I guess Don lowered his head and took another sip, and this time he didn't dare let the drink stay in his throat for a second, and it just came pouring out, and the pain was so much lighter.
Another round of laughter.
A man touches his head, indicating his understanding.
The other one had helped Don to get the fence up, and he'd have been told: "Looks like our coach, Tony, has had his head bashed in!" The guy sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, two-time European Cup winner and 1978 Stanley Cup winner, Kenny Burns! He's a hundred times stronger than you stupid donkey!
The laughter, the screaming of the asshole, the screaming of the donkey, and the cold, unprotected hand of the object of his mockery brought out the only half glass of wine in his hand. The golden scotch whisky, glistening brilliantly in the light, made a beautiful arc in the air, and then accurately shot at the face of the bastard with the fine fine like David Beckham's right foot free-kick. Wow!
His bad words were swallowed back by a thick cup of wine; Dunne, with an unexpected rush, threw a glass of wine at the other. His breath had become unbearable, and he unexpectedly came to this place, for four and a half years, unexpectedly passed through, unexpectedly ridiculed and insulted... He wanted to find someone to spill it for now, whether he knocked somebody down or somebody knocked him down.
The two hit the back of the table, the empty bottle fell, and the floor shattered in a crack.
But the laughter stopped and everyone was silent. They did not know that Tony, who had just looked like a coward, would suddenly explode.
The first person to react was bar owner Kenny Burns, who pushed a fat guy standing next to the bar and shouted "What are you doing standing there?
Besides the misery on the ground, the slain had blood splattered on his forehead, where there was a red circle, the mark of the mouth of the glass. Besides, he had been struck on the left cheek as if drunk with wine.
And Don, with nothing but a mess of his head and clothes. He seemed to have exhausted his rage when he was dragged off, and without getting up to chase after him, he packed his clothes and his head and then said to the poor devil who was dragged along:
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry I've made such a mess of things for you today... It's so fucked up... I'm sure he'll be mad if I cross him... I'll come myself and apologise".
Then, without waiting for the sign from the master of the house, he turned and walked to the door. When he passed the fat man, he said to him, "Eat your milk and drink it yourself, fat pig.
They watched him push the door and go, and no one dared to stop him, but they watched him go and leave a badly broken man behind.
A silence in the bar. At this moment the drunken devil sat up from his table, stared at the silence of the house and the confusion, and asked in confusion: What have I missed?
Don't be a fool! Let me go back, let me go back! Could Dawn cry like that?
If your own life was pretty bad, why not take advantage of this opportunity to have a different life than the one he had before? Even though he's never been a football coach, but he watched the game for over a decade, and played every generation of football managers, it's a good opportunity to find out about the nature of the work of some coaches, is not it?
He no longer needs to think about why God chose him, the dull question ≠ he needs to think about how to be more like a real professional coach, and even if it is hard, it's worth it.
Hey, dude. You barged into my house without my permission, and I swear I'll call the alarm if you don't leave!
Don looked at the old man who was standing across from him, holding a load of newspapers and a half-eaten hamburger in his hand.
Oh this...is this your house? Oh, he's referring to the chair under his ******.
Oh, of course.
Oh, sorry to bother you... She stood up from her chair, and immediately sat down on the floor, and then lay down. She put the newspapers on her body and pressed them firmly between the back of the chair and her body.
Seeing the contented beggar eating a hamburger, lying in a tray of newspapers, Dawn even thanked God that she had not let herself get too attached to him. His fate was not bad.
A taxi pulled up in front of him, and he walked quickly and then drilled in. Dawn had one last look at the beggar laying in the cold wind, enjoying a delicious supper with his uncle, and asked the driver to take him back to the strange house.
From today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Dawn. The winds and the sunshine of Saturday morning, the glitter on the road to sterilization... to the sterilization of his cat.
One of the feline bags in hand is a yellow rose cat, also known as a greycat, a type of a country cat. The head, back, and limbs are covered in a layer of yellow-orange streaks.
The white glove is said to have a lethal effect on girls, controlling their brain waves and causing them to make a sound like "Ahh, ahh, aah".
Even though it is only a male cat, its eyes are big and very sexy.
At this point the cat is screaming her lungs out. Most domestic cats are very homesick and would prefer to stay at home for the rest of their lives, to move or go out is something terrible for them. Showing off is the only thing that will comfort the cat.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dim meteor slowly traverses outer space, gradually flying over China, the surface of the meteoroid glowing with a strange glow and seemingly emitting some kind of ray continually towards the surrounding vacuum.
In the Star Star Pet Hospital, Yang Yew placed the cat bag on the front desk: I have a sterilized pet, I've made an appointment with him, his surname is Zeng.
If you have not visited us before, you need to fill in the information sheet of the health history card. ☐
In outer space, a meteor slowly passed over mainland China and started moving towards the Pacific Ocean, where the meteor passed, many of the cats suddenly shivered, and a deep gleam gleamed in their eyes, just like the glow emitted from the meteor.
Matcha suddenly moved, struggling to get up and ran towards the door of the hospital.
The little nurse screamed, and the next man who was boasting shouted back, grabbing at the matcha that had escaped.
The speed of the display was too slow to catch the body of the matcha, but only caught the matcha's tail.
The tail was grabbed, the tea made a roar, and instinctively he turned his head and bit towards Boao, which was the instinct of the feline, the speed was also incredible, instantly opened a mouth on the back of the boao's hand, the boao's back ached, and he immediately let loose the palm.
He knew he was in the wrong, but instead of continuing to run, he curled up and stared with some uncomfortable astonishment at the spectacle.
"Oh cat, you bit what you bite, it is a crime!"
The eyes of the matcha cat flashed a flash of light, and the silk trails on his teeth disappeared completely.
He wanted to look at the wound on the back of his hand, but it was only a glimpse, a small shadow, a clean patch of his hand on the back, without any wounds or blood.
The small nurse next to him then comforted the cat saying: "I'll make you some tea, it's okay, I'll be fine, don't worry".
In the boastful ears, it wasn't simply a cat cry, but it became a speech that could be understood.
Shocked, Yao pointed at the matcha in front of her, and with a surprised expression said: "Oh, this... this... this cat is talking!
The little nurse looked at Yao with a puzzled expression and said, "Mr. Yang, are you okay?"
"Hey, didn't you hear that?" said Yang Yiwu in a hushed voice. "Fuck it... it's speaking!"
The little nurse raised her eyebrows, and her dazzling glance became more and more strange.
Can you hear me?
Please take me home!
I was scared to pee.
He opened his mouth proudly, looked at the little nurse who was still unconscious and comforting Matcha, looked at her again and said: "Mom, can you hear me?
I can hear, I can hear, I need to go home, take me home, oh oh oh.
The little nurse on the other side turned her head to look at the boast of talking to the cat, and her face went weird.
Despite the strange gaze of the nurse, Zhao Yiyang quickly took the matcha tea and put it back in her bag and ran out of the hospital.
In the house, the tea cat returns to its familiar surroundings, immediately relax, lies on the tea table and starts to play with her white hands, eyes up, relaxed face. For cats, tearing off hair has always been a very good way to relax.
Before the tea, Bhaiya was staring at the matcha cat that was dying, trying to say, "Oh my gosh, can you still talk?"
When he had said this, he stood up to their feet and jumped on his face. "Are you kidding me? " he demanded.
But this... wait and play again. Liu Yao grabbed the back of his head, a little confused, he said, "When did you learn to speak?"
Looking at the face of a pure tea cat, flaunting a face of bizarreness.
The cat did not feel weird at all about the situation at hand, suddenly jumped into the arms of the show, stared at the show body with his eyes, and said, "Come and play with me".
As they watch each other, talking like a five-year-old, the Matcha Cat starts touching each other's heads, and the latter shows his hoar-hoar of pleasure.
If you add up the number, you are only one year old, which is equivalent to human aging five years ago. You are still a child, and that seems a bit cool.
A month later, at 9:00 am
Showing his tired face, he opened the door of the cabin, took off his clothes and sat down on the sofa.
Even though the rent is only thirty paise, but the fully furnished house he lives in is a former house for a newly married couple, and it is close to the company, so that he works overtime every day and doesn't need to worry about traffic problems, so even though the rent is not cheap, it still lets him show off his willingness.
After Yang Yue lay down, the Matcha Cat unconsciously climbed up to his side, and held his arm with her head, a kind and warm look.
Yang Yao smiled and patted the head of Yang Macha, who showed a look of enjoyment.
But at the same time, the matcha on the mobile phone on the sofa was pushed forward.
Chapter 1
Don Quixote sat on the table, her thin white arms resting on her little head, and her long, dark hair that hangs out like a wig was hanging in the air, revealing her small, bright, half-girl face, warm, hot.
What happened?
There's a constant hot and dry burn burning her face and making her feel bad. Today she came to Tetou from Yao City and just drank a glass of white water that Han Chiyo-san had brought.
Han Hyo-jung, her sister from her father's side.
She was not well, Don jumped down and ran after her, couldn't let her run away!
Tan Xiaoli is a spirited girl, half awake, but Han Chiao-yi has designed her!
What should I do?
Don looked at the man, like he'd caught a lifesaving herb, "Mr. Wang, save me, I've been drugged, there are a few men behind me who want to blow me up".
The men, who were cold and dark, crossed the girls and looked behind them, and the men had faint, but chilling looks on their faces.
The men, who are also little misfits, they see the man who covered the headlines of the financial magazines, who controls the whole economic life of the Empire they've seen on TV.
It was a good day.
The man they could not bear so they turned and fled. In a place entirely shrouded in darkness, a fearful battle was taking place, with angels of flaming wings, knights in heavy armor, crusaders armed with long long golden swords, battling with a horde of dark-smoked Ospians, horrifying Knights of Death, and an evil army of legionnaires, without number.
The scene of the massacre, not in a plain of fire and smoke or a tomb full of skeletons, but in a darkness so dark that no edge is seen, is a strange picture.
But what was more bizarre was that outside the battlefield, in the void covered by endless darkness, a few voices of secret agreements could be heard whispering.
Oh, my God, oh my God, my God, oh my God.
The rider of death and the moving fortress have been attacked! Oh! Oh!
O Lord, where are my troops? or who is my adversary? where is the enemy?
After the battle is over, the angels, the knights and the ranchery who were present on the battlefield disappear into the darkness of the background, returning to an absolute silence shrouded by endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened before.
But several voices continue to communicate, and even more voices have joined in.
my comrades-in-arms are just a bunch of pigs! the bulldogs are stronger than them! not only do they do not help with the battle, they are trying to take the command of the core forces...the voice that had lost before me said something displeasing ∼
Oh! it is clear that dead spirits are so cowardly, if replaced by my legions of demons, it will be different... Another voice of the dead also made a strong counter-attack, and made this forceful apology for their faulty command: Oh I would have thought that the knights of death could easily solve those fortresses.
After this, a few laughs came through in the darkness, and the arguing sides became despondent and said helplessly to the victorious side: "The clash is not as good as man, I will bow to the wind ".
And the winner gets to give a round of uncouth mockery, too?
Oh, oh, justice will triumph over evil at last!
You who tremble before our power, whether dead or devils, even the gods will kill you.
That is no doubt the irritating thing, and the parties who were already so calm are suddenly engaged in a new round of clashes, and the third party, who is out of the victor's side of this new battlefield, is desperately asking: "Oh, shouldn't I organize this round of games?"
The one before the great and terrible war was just a game.
One voice, not participating in the game, responded: "It's wonderful that you have the talent to simulate a realistic war and put us, the bystanders, in this scenario, you were very good at surprising us, I hope".
And the guy called Hope, facing the other guy, in his sudden gratitude, responds with a low voice: "You got the prize, it is just for fun ".
Yes, this battle between the forces of good and evil is but a distraction, adding only a bit of joy to this endless prison.
In this field of the void beyond the realm of reality, it must be forever dark, cold, and silent, a place where no living creature will exist, a field that is more terrible than death.
Yet in such a place, this dead place which could hardly contain any living beings, lives stubbornly a group of unqualified creatures, who have lost their bodies, and only the last consciousness remains to exist in this void.
They call themselves the workers of the void, imprisoned for ever in this prison called the void 
Before they were imprisoned, they were the super-powers of each race and field, the magistrates who reached the heights of magic, the fighters who touched the limits of martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the persevering high and pure missionaries, the demons who ruled hell, the demons who controlled souls, and so on. They have left their names in the history of each facet.
Many think they are long extinct, and that the only records of their existence that they possess are those of the history, without knowing that these old monsters, strong enough to be described by metamorphoses, are actually imprisoned in an infinite void beyond the surface where they have spent an incalculable number of years and seem to be imprisoned forever, where the seemingly thin barrier between the surface and the void is a wall of sighs that they can never break, and yet the powers with which they once possessed are as strong as ever.
But they never gave up hope of escape, because among the 33 void walkers, there was an extremely special being: the fifth, codenamed Hope.
Hope Ba, not a person from space, who's just a small space for human existence, but from a strange place called Earth, was once the editor of a small news site, whose daily job was to scrape news from other websites around the country and abroad, and replace it with a page like Bang!
It's just a lot of work to be able to post a headline that men will scream and women will be silent, but then put on their own website, a noisy and boring job.
Later, when Bai Yi died as a result of an accident, his consciousness didn't immediately disappear, but instead entered the mysterious void under the mist, devoured several other void walkers, and finally survived until this moment.
Voidwalkers insist that he from the other world will be the key to escape this endless prison, but you are different, want to get out of here, you are our only chance, I firmly believe, that is why I call you by this code of hope. Oh first Voidwalker, the wizard of the code once said so.
They had been believing it, believing that they would one day see the sun again, even though they had been imprisoned for countless hours, for hundreds of years, for thousands of years.
It was clearly not enough to chat or discuss and to hold on for thousands of years in this eternal prison without going mad. In fact, the main means of entertaining the Vagabonds was an activity called memory sharing.
The event is based on a cognitive technique called memory retrospection, which allows a person to recall every detail of their experiences, even every single spot on the newspaper page, clearly.
And then, by clipping away some of the memories that you don't want people to see, things like sleeping with women or sleeping with a right-handed person, then swapping the memories out with the other person, it's like watching a superhero movie about someone else's life, which is a great way to pass time.
The memory of the thirty-three void walkers equals to his experience of thirty-three lives, even if later, in order to avoid confusion of memory, he forgot most of it, retaining only their knowledge and experience, but his state of mind, also in the course of his thirty-three lives, got over these weaknesses of childhood and impetuousness, became mature and calm, and was no longer that ordinary person on earth.
Thus, he was encouraged by other idle people, and yet years and years went by, and even he found no chance of breaking free, all he could do was to make the dull, boring period a little less boring.
At the same time, the real East is just about to fall into the dark, and as the sun sets over the entire campus, the students finally finish the day's heavy learning, accompanied by young and spirited cheering and laughing, three, three, two, three, and two take a stroll down a leafy alley on the campus.
One of the students is Miya, a second-year student in Souk, who has a lovely gray face and long black hair twisted into two equally cute double ponytails, and wears the standard uniform of Senshi College. After a simple farewell to her classmates, she comes alone to the school square, finds a bench, sits down, takes a half of the left-over bread from her jacket pocket and carefully chops the bread into little shards, then carefully kneads them on the asphalt floor of the square.
In a few moments, a flurry of wings came from the air, and several white swallows flew over to Mia's feet, with their heads bowed, eating the bread she had dropped, along with a shrill scream. Mia carefully slid her wings, and her long horsetails swept the land as she walked, looking at the group and the other rabbits that she had been familiar with, her face lit up with a smile of relief.
The beautiful maidens, the docile white lions, the quiet square of statues, along with the lush vegetation around it, all came together in the final golden afterglow of the sunset, to form a picture of a beautiful mermaid.
This is what Miya does every day, and this is her most relaxed moment of the day, as a normal graduate student, life at Sentsho Academy is always so hard.
It's almost dark, come here today, I have to go back to practice. Goodbye, rabbit men. With a light smile on her face, Mia waved goodbye to the rabbits, took her short-sleeved clothes, hung her slim legs wrapped in white silk, and hurried back to her dormitory.
The evening is also an important time to study, especially for a gifted student like Mia, whose efforts are not as effortless as she who always seems to have a smile on her face.
1. Chapter 1
The ceremony to awaken the spirits of the Wu family is being held in the Su family mansion, a huge war arena.
This young man on the altar, whose name is Sue, is the eldest son of Sue's family, and is very gifted.
Sumo, the son of Su clan head Su Hong, completed the nine-fold stance at the age of 14, known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has emerged, the martial spirit that awakens with Sumo's talent will definitely not be worse than Su Yu.
If the sumo could also awaken the martial soul of the fifth level of humanity above, then the Su family could emerge two top geniuses this time, whose future development of the Su family would be nothing short of extraordinary.
As soon as the teacher shouted the name, the shocked students, elders, and so on, looked at the clever youth by his side and looked at him expectantly, excitedly and even more than the previous Suyu.
His face was calm, and he raised his feet and walked down to the altar.
Sue came down from the altar, and her face full of arrogance, a cold, cold smile toward Sumo, her eyes full of provocation.
Without considering the other, Sumo took a deep breath and sat down on her knees with her eyes closed.
From under the altar, a ray of guidance began to pierce and penetrate into the body of Sumo.
His talents were at the top of his class, and he completed his bodywork at the age of fifteen. However, he was always overwhelmed by Sumo.
At this time, the shining symbols on the altar were becoming more and more numerous, wrapping all around Sumo's body.
Sumo, with his eyes closed, breathed rapidly, and the sound of a roar rose from his body.
Everyone stopped breathing, and the dead stared at the altar!
Hum!
Finally, a sound broke, and a dark shadow suddenly rose, like a black hole, slowly revolving inside, deep without bottom, giving a cold feeling.
At the same time, a yellow halo shines above the shadow.
Oh, my God.
At that moment, all eyes stopped in the entire arena.
A halo?
The lowest of the low?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu was stunned with a frown.
Because, unbeknownst to him, the first genius of the Sui family only awakened the martial soul of the first-rate martial spirit, the lowest martial spirit!
Sumosatsu sat down on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, he saw his own warrior soul, and he also became agitated.
The first class martial soul...! Yang Sumo said this to himself, with a bitter grin in the corner of his mouth, he had no idea that he had awakened a lowest class martial soul!
This is the most garbage martial spirit ever!
The first genius was the first waste of my family.
For a while, everyone, including the elders and the ministers, looked at Sumo in a different way, with disappointment, disdain and contempt.
At the altar, Sumo slowly got up and unconsciously tightened her fists.
She looked around at her husband, smiling in her heart: "These people are really smart!"
In the past, the talent of the sumo is exceptional, everyone was so hospitable to him, wherever he went, he was greeted by the sound of horses beating.
Now that he has awakened the junk-bending spirits, those people immediately changed their faces.
Sumo shook his head, did not compare, and walked away from the altar.
Some bruises on his face, and what seemed to be a patch of grass around him.
I didn't die in a car accident, how did I live?
He was a little surprised, but before he knew how he had escaped death, the sight caused him to immediately roll his eyes in excitement.
How can such a beautiful girl be so free?
Xu Zhixuan opened his eyes. He tearfully looked at the beautiful girl completely before his eyes, the obscenity in it came out little by little, into his eyes was a soft and white, and with a unique womanly scent.
Girl, what are you doing, you can't pee all over the place!
The whole scene was shattered. She screamed, and shaking in panic, the whole group jumped from the floor, and the sword flew across the sky.
I'll rely on, is this the sword, the flying sword?
But what is a fairy?
But at the same time, a strange and familiar memory was popping out of Xu Jie's mind, as if she had been born into a certain experience.
I fucking got through!
Immediately, Xu's mind read the file, but it was not his own memory, and he could not make sense of it.
Here is a fairy world, just like the little fairy in the front of the angry sword in the air, people can practice all kinds of skills like Zen.
And the owner of his own body is now a donkey-mule, and he is a complete fool.
He is a poor orphan, with a unique roots that are rare for a thousand years.
In his youth, he was hired by the emperor by chance to be a horse, providing countless treasures for him to train, and in just six years he solidified his belly, entered the golden age.
When, on the day that he stepped into the golden age, he really entered the cave with the princess, and spent seven days and seven nights in the marriage bed, the fair fairy-faced princess, like a fox, did a total repair of his body and even his spiritual endowment was taken away at the same time.
The genius Yue Ma-hui was only married and was reduced to a worthless person. He was sent out of the Palace in a low tone during the night, and was beaten to death by a handful of people arranged by the Emperor on the way to the border, dying of exhaustion, and finally left as a corpse.
Oh, what a pity!
Clear of those memories, Xu's face was discolored with grief, he shook his head and sighed and exclaimed, "Oh damn it, why didn't you take a step earlier, and move on to the fun time when you can exercise madly in bed with Princess Mei?"
Thinking about the beauty of the princess who sold her soul on her wedding bed, the arrogance of the body, and the breathing of every wind, Xue Shi felt more and more sorry that he had taken a step late.
You cowardly whore, how dare you steal my virgin as a thorn, to give me my life.
And a voice of rebuke was suddenly heard, and the fairy went and returned.
She was full of shame and anger, but her eyes were full of a sense of murder, and under her feet, with the sword of the cold-blooded, she came to kill him.
"Stand on me, Fairy, this is absolutely a misunderstanding! I have seen that your ass is where I am lying, and... even if you want to kill me, you would please lift up your neck first, right?
The woman suddenly changed her face, and, mentioning the indecency of the red-faced officer, shrieked, and cried out: "You whore, you desired death"! The sword flew faster at her feet, and she was heading for Shu Shu.
He'd been running around like crazy trying to find a way to escape.
Suddenly, an inspiration flashed in my mind.
She paused, reached out and touched a familiar sign from her arm, turned and called out to her, 'O brave old hag, I am the head of the Fire Nation, and you disrespect me? Beware!
Suddenly, a series of systematic prompts began to sound in his head.
Congratulations to host Liu Xu Xiufan, who activated the forced face system, which will help you escort your plane, help you to get ready and help you fly!
Congratulations host Wu Xuxian's costume for forcing was successful, a reward for forcing worth 1 point, is it to be in the mall for the exchange?
The system detects that host Xu-Feng's abilities are poor and that it is difficult for him to survive in this difficult world, and the system rewards the novice with a large gift.
When the sound is activated, a light-screen window appears along with several pieces of information.
Xu Shi took a breath and laughed, then laughed loudly. What a face-busting system this was, that had just been made for me to help me break through the heavenly system! Now that was fun indeed.
Why do you laugh, you whore, to the death?
Suddenly, a scream brought Xu Zhi back from his ecstasy.
The woman stood before him not knowing when, at the distance of ten cubits, with a spear in her hand, aimed at him; but the great eyes of the water spirit were watching him, and watching him.
Come on... you want to mess with me... will you step closer to me?
Hey, congratulations to host Qiu Xue-shi-chan, the success of the dress was rewarded with a dress of 1 point △ ↓
Of course, Xue Zi's system prompts that only he could hear sounded again, and he couldn't help but laugh again.  It's true, there's more of the present.
Suddenly, the picture of the screen window changed to a square gift box appeared and the box was opened, and several streams of light came out and flew away.
The host, Kang Xiuchiang, received her initial first level experience, which is worth 10,000 experience.
Congratulations to host Xue Xu Shizhuang for receiving two new Starter-Class Walking Stones, which can be used to instantaneously move any place outside the five square kilometers.
Qian is congratulating host Wu Xuxian on getting the first stage of the five-line Taiji (Tajik) (note: the first stage can only be cultivated until the construction stage, after which it can be exchanged in the mall).
Hey, a defect has been found in the host Yin Xu, which does not meet the conditions, and the system will replenish all the other Yin roots for you.
At that moment, Xu Ziyi felt an electric current pass through her body, and her scalp instantly became numb.
The next was a feeling of comfort, the folds of the body completely opened, the greedy breathing in all directions.
Hum!
Soon, he felt a change in his body, a profound transformation that was closer to nature, as if he were in control of everything.
But he knew how familiar the feeling was, such warm feeling for the Flame when the Fire-Ghost Root had not been snatched away by the Princess, and now the system not only restored his Fire-Ghost Root but also the other properties of the Ghosts Root.
The five roots of the five spirits are all at the same time, and each one is the highest degree of the Zhou Celestial Order.
I was left, this is the opposite of heaven!
When she thought about it, Xuexiu finally couldn't resist shaking her arms and shouting: "The system is in my hands, what the hell do I have, what a damn fire emperor, what the hell is my Emperor, until I get an upgrade and return to Xuexiu, I will trample you all to pieces".
Does the bold whore, calling herself a wild horse of fire, dare to speak folly, and to flatter the emperor? Does the woman near the whore hear a little bit of whoring, a crazy horse of folly?
Hey, congratulations host Wu Xu-Hiao, your audition was a success and your audition got 1 point.
Xu Shih's tongue pulled at the corner of his mouth, looking intently at the future, almost forgetting the present trouble. He had to hurry to find a way to run.
That's right, experience Dan!
He suddenly remembered that he had another first-class experience, Dan.
Without hesitation, the user inquired about the operating system interface, opened the package, and found three items inside it.
Use, use.  Xue Xuan held onto two of these objects and cried out in his heart.
Congratulations to our host Ms. Xu Shijin for practicing the five lines of the Tao Te Ching.
Q, host Yu Xujian Yu, took the first level experience dan and got 10,000 experience value.
The host, Song Xuqian, was upgraded to the 1st level of the current realm's training period.
You are now on the third level of the current level, and that's the third level of the current realm.
The host was renamed Xue Zhizhi, which is the tenth level of the current realm of exaltation.
In just a short space of time, Xu Zhiji went from a poor mortal to a monk and sprinted straight to the tenth level of the auspicious epoch, just one step away from the foundation.
And his current strength is ten times stronger than the normal exercise session.
The reason is that he has the five divine roots, which means that a person has five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under these five qualities of the five different spirits, the force that is released is far less than five times as simple.
I really said nothing this time, I can not fight, who can not fight?
He became agitated. But in this moment the woman in front of him waved a stream of light through the clouds, the sharp edge of her sword came between her eyes like a poisonous snake.
Give me a chance, fairy, I only ask you, you little fairy, to come and give me a ride. Who ordered you to draw your sword? You are a robber!
Xu Xiong saw a flying sword attack, jumped suddenly, and opened his mouth to curse.
But the foot movements were not at all vague, they slid back and forth, and the tips of the fingers were filled with a stream of water, lightly shooting at the sword blade that came against them.
The dog!
The sound of a slashing was heard, and the sword was thrown from its scabbard.
Wow... how could this be?
The woman was immediately stopped, and the Zongmen was able to crack that sword with such ease, except for those who built it in a high, inexplicable way, not to mention, the brothers and sisters who built the sixth floor of the foundation were able to do it!
I was confused, everyone said it was a misunderstanding, you're still confused, do you want to kill me? Don't think you look like a fairy, I will not hit you, anyway, I just haven't seen clearly, this time I will see clearly.
Xu Zicheng said, and stepped forward, the spirit of the native land instantly melted into the earth, its speed was greatly increased, and in a flash appeared in front of the woman.
Then, a stream of water spirits burst forth from the palm of her heart, surrounding her, and the woman could only have reacted to this in time and was then put under restraint.
The woman became disoriented, and she felt that the fire in her body was completely suppressed.
Ah! If you all call me a whore, then can I bear this shame?
Xu Shige, with a grin on his face, raised his brow, and waved his hand directly at the girl.
Chapter One If there is a future, dance with me!
The nine heavens, the clouds, the sea, the thunder, the sky!
In there were nine great heavens and three great continents and three days, one on each side of the earth, and wind was blowing from it. There the wind could receive thunder, and go up into the sky.
But right now, the wind on the stage is a hurricane, a mist!
Chu Chuyang, give up your sword of death and live.
Yang Chuyang, nine-blade sword and so the first gods of the universe in your hands, pure waste, how many years, you have no progress, the whole is a storm of the heavens! Or give it up.
A loud cry came from all sides.
The eyes are still as cool as a rock, the body is still as straight as a spear.
As the sword in his hand, full of relentless meaning, even though he's been mortally wounded.
At his feet, hundreds of meters in circumference, lay countless broken parts, stained with blood.
Looking around at the loud shouts, and not seeing the multitude of the elite who had rushed by, Chu Yang's face showed a smile of arrogance.
A man like this is in heart, and is fairer, and is more numerous than he, though he slay me ten thousand times, he is not worthy of me.
How can it leak out that the nine-claw sword is in his hand? After three years of studying and researching, he finally found out what happened to the 9th sword in the last three days of the stormy season, spent a lot of time and effort to finally find the opportunity to risk his life and come for three days, but why did he come here and face such a big ambush?
To-day is he entering the third day, and it is only the fifth day. To-day's business, pure and simple death, he is always known in passing by in cunning, and who knows his own scheme?
A dozen times in succession, each time, they were pulled back, and those places they chose, belong to the Horn of Death.
Extremely compassionate, extremely sword-like! Destroys his soul in the sword, in the martial arts with the sword, in the martial arts seeking heaven, in life loneliness at the expense, killing all over the world for the treasure of the world, alas, finally still can not practice the nine-layered sword, practice the nine-fold angel work.
Is that the wrong choice, or is it the wrong path?
If a swordsman has compassion, what is a swordsman, a ruthless swordsman, a ruthless swordsman? The martial arts of the martial arts and fencing, in the end, are ruthless.... Why so much hesitation at the time of life and death?
O sword of death, what is your secret?
He looked around him, greedily gazing at the sword of death, Chu Sun-yong laughed bitterly. You only know that getting this sword of death will be unbeatable in heaven, but do you know how much I paid for this sword of death?
Everything is gone.
Blood flowed, Chu Yang felt clearly that his life was passing rapidly, he had pursued martial arts all his life, falling in love, falling out of love, out of love to the heartlessness and finally dying, at the moment of death, he thought that the only regret should be that the lifetime did not reach the highest level he pursued all his life, but what surprised him was that at this moment, one of the shadows emerged in his mind, which he had thought he had forgotten long ago.
Do not dance, Chu Yang, the woman who is in love with you!
I am not really in love....I had a self-deprecating smile on my lips and I was saying to myself:
A small penitence, quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, instantly overwhelmed his whole heart.
Don't you think we could meet you this time at the Yellow Spring?
Let us go up together! Let us put him to death! And as for the sword of nine deaths, we deliberated without delay. One man cried out: "If not, wait until he answers, it will be our turn to do a lot of things". The people all around were frightened, and suddenly swords were drawn together, and came against Chu Yang.
Dance all your life, dance for the king, dance through the life!
This is a small poem by Mo Lu-dan written on the night of the appointed time. He remembers Mo Lu-dan with tears in her eyes, her eyes were confused and resentful, she... knew that she was practising meditation with her feelings, but she was still catching fire in her arms, let herself burn as much as possible!
After hearing the news, he was chased away, but in the end, it was a step late. Although after him, the family of the deceased who had harmed Mo's dancing all tried to kill the whole family, not even the Nine tribe chicken dog was left, but the good people could not come back to life!
And the man of eternal redness, dying softly in his arms, said to himself: "Yang Chu Yang, if there is another life... If I can meet you again, I hope you are well... look at me. I am better than the sword!
Dance lightly, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how could your eyes be sore?
Two drops of sweet wine, but his heart, that at that moment smashed with cotton, from then on this heart covered with dust.
Life and death are synonymous.
This is a poem that was written by the first talent of the world, Zheng Xin, who had felt a deep affection for Zhuyang.
Now, slowly dance, you are nine, and I am still in the human world... but, I can immediately be with you in life and in death... life and in eternity!
Chu Yang's heart racing, thinking of God, and a soft smile hanging from the corner of his cold, hard mouth.
Let's dance, wait for me!
Dance, thou knowest that if I should live, I would rather build no sword than climb no peak; and not revenge, but to be with thee. What is the laugh in the world to be satisfied with thee?
No! no pain... dance gently, you are painful, but do not feel pain, now... I am painful!
The sword became more and more, the blood flew out, the pain was concentrated all over the body and finally broke the song and dance in my mind!
The angry longhorn of Chuyang, standing up, his black hair flying furiously.
His face was aching; he looked down, and the jade hanging on his neck shattered before his eyes.
This is the only memory I have of my life!
SHOT! Yang Chu Yang raised his head, with the kill madly running, drinking madly, his sword in his hand suddenly swung to the light of a man-made sword, and suddenly, like nine days of thunderbolt, suddenly became a belt of light!
And the voice of the great and mighty God sounded, and all the weapons that were round about him were cut in pieces.
Everyone rushed back, terrified to look at the round of weapons and knives at his feet, and sweating in his jacket.
Chuyang looked around, then suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Nine-Dark Sword?"
When no one could answer, he laughed coldly, and said, "Yes; I will show you the sword of the ninth degree.
Suddenly, he jumped! He had been mortally wounded and then jumped up!
The sword of the Nine-Tails, a little cold, a great sword!
As the arc is shot out, thousands of freezing thunderbolts rush out!
A sword! A sword!
Nine-fold heaven is the name of the continent. All the sword movements in history have never dared to use these three words, but this Nine-fold Heaven Sword is the name of the Dragon of Nine-fold Heaven.
This is the only one!
Although Chuyang was unable to use the real power of the Ninja Sword, he realized the swords had been long ago. The power of the swords, although not as big as imagined, was also far beyond the mundane sword.
Dozens of experts, who knew that the sword was not a mere piece, took all the pieces from the bottom of the press case, tried to resist this attack! Everyone's body trembled, feeling the weapon in his hands, and they were unsettled.
I would rather blade a sword of nine strokes, than kill the whole world!
The voice of the dead man shall sound like the roar of a great sea, which cannot be stopped, whose death covered the face of the whole earth.
The cry was heard, and the eleven, who were strong enough to fight for a single side, at the same time tried to resist, but still were bleeding, and were driven back.
At this moment, everyone has an illusion: Chu Yang is completely unharmed now, totally healthy!
Unknown to them, they cut off Chuyang's memory, cut off the singing of the dance, and allowed Chuyang to become completely enraged and to unleash all the potential of his body! This is the power of life, the rage of the soul!
The sword of nine rounds, a cloud of winds is the king!
Chu Yang Huan opened his eyes, and whispered, "Why didn't you cry?"
In the distance, in three directions, three lights rise at once, appearing in the air three golden shadows!
He was just the warrior, a little below the rank of the king, but he was only below the rank of the heavens and the earth.
Three Kings! What a great pencil!
But for three days, not in a place where a sword can be spread by your sword-master, I live alone with a man. The way is slow, I only wish that I could not fight with you on equal terms; alas, that's bad enough.
With this, two others appeared. Three men, all with broad coats on their sleeves, came, dressed in their clothes and with a sigh. They were in great stature, and their faces were gloomy.
Chuyang's eyes are now dim: "Oh, you three kings...you want the sword of doom, too?"
He's just trying to kill you! The three of them smile at the same time, and are thrilled: You are a surprise win, but by the way, you're a surprise win!
And he laughed and he stood up and said, "Woe to you who do not understand, for you will never know". So he was blind in his vision.
He is no longer able to fight!
This is the only sword he can wield with full power and once he saw the hilt of the sword he knows that he can wield it by himself. But the sword that needs to be wielded with his life!
It is the sword that takes the life and destroys everything.
The three kings, who could scarcely have the audacity to come, the grief to come, the ashes and smoke to go, even if the golden shadow of their kingly strength, in which they had the illusion, still glowed in the sky, but their lives had been reduced to nothing.
Chu Yang sighed, half-empty, his eyes wandering, and then found a person that he believed he should never be here. In the distance, a man in white was looking at him dumbfounded, his face full of unbelief.
What time is it? Liu Cheuying's eyes have been watering and he finally understands why so many of his hidden acts are being covered up, and why all his attacks are being stopped by humans!
This man was a very godless creature. No wonder he was so miserable.
Chuang's body slowly fell from the sky, slowly fell down, like dead leaves in the late autumn, fell into the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, and shouted the words: "Dance lightly, if there is life, dance with me under heaven!"
Since death is inevitable, embrace it with the greatest fervor and the greatest longing, for there is your own loved one.
Chapter two
Munchi's happiness was interrupted and became shy, while the eyes of the young samurai like Cheddar were surprised and scorned, there was no elementary school student who wanted to clear the boundaries with the bad students, only Hokkyukyo Fuwa A7 looked at the Golden Buddha statue in front, a divine appearance above heaven.
In his subconscious mind, Mench turned half-heartedly, and looked at the next room, to see if he could see anything.
For him, shame and frustration are small, but the fact that he exposed himself for the ransom is the big thing!
But his face was still full of bitterness, and his eyes were full of despair. When he saw Menshi looking at him, he shook his head slightly: Yang Nan has no Amitabha Buddha, everything is decided by his brother in the shrine. He did not indicate it but said it directly.
Oh, he thought I thought he was begging for mercy...Mengchi, silently relieving himself inside, realizes that he has passed this stage, that unless he abandons the parents of this body, uncle Horseface and so on, he should not be seen, and if in another ten or eight years, then more and more doubt, the memories of childhood would be easily forgotten.
It's a small thing to be put in a shithouse!
M'tch tries to keep his face as quiet as his true self, in order to avoid being seen as a person who is less depressed and sad.
After the big-eared scholar had questioned the rest of the children one by one, Gan Ben and Choi Huie, six were admitted to the mixed prison, and the rest belonged to the martial monastery ≫.
The ring finger of his right hand gently tapped his left palm: "Come with me to the monastery to shave, take the Buddhist mantle and so on and in the future, live hard without trying to enter the Bodhisatta and Damo Lama to practice the Buddha's deep teachings and Kung Fu".
Is there a Damo here too?
He thought for a moment, but did not have time to think, and went straight through the children, and walked outside the temple.
All around were strangers, and Mengyi didn't dare ask any more questions. He followed the yellow monks closely, and crept into a nearby courtyard.
If you don't have the official entrance, just pray to the Buddha and shave your name. Zhong Zhen was pointing to the secret road in the small Buddha.
They all answered in truth, then one by one, they knelt on the relic and bowed to the statue of the Buddha above them.
After all the children had prostrated themselves to the Buddha, he joined his hands together, saluted the statues, and recited the Zen Buddhist hymn, the Buddha. He then walked up to one of the children, and placed his right hand on his head.
With its long dark hair, its roots and roots turned yellow, withered, and withered as fast as a Mendeleev could see, and in less than two breaths, the child became a real Shamim.
The worries are over, the red dust is far away. Zhong Qiao has said a solemn word, the rich sound of the chant resounds in the pure Buddha hall.
What kind of martial arts is this?
He is shocked and excited, and wonders if he will have the opportunity to learn martial arts in the future.
The barber came to the children one by one, and pulled off their hair, and repeated the same things.
When it was the turn of Menshi, he bowed his head and recited the name of the Buddha, lamenting that he was to be separated from his hair.
The thick and broad hand gently touched the top of the Monkey's head and a dead root fell before his eyes, which made him sad and hard to hold on, but he loved the red dust, and never thought of becoming a monk.
Your troubles are over, the red dust is far from you.
The sound of his anguish was like a sudden alarm bell which shook Méndez, and his heart was clear.
After the departure of Ka-chan and the end of her purity, Mengshi's faith is still strong, and will be invariably renewed in the future!
After the Byphda, shaving, and naming the monk, the monk had a few gray-clad monks take the kids to the backyard to collect their belongings, two sets of gray monk robes, two pairs of shoes, a small wooden rule box, 12 small meditation bowls, and so on.
Let's wait for the time when you are studying the words in the prayer hall, you can recite the precepts of the temple and the small chant in the morning. Before this, I will first roughly tell the main precept of the temple, one, no one may deceive the teacher to kill the father, two, do not allow, do not steal martial arts, three, do not kill, four, do not drink alcohol, five, prohibited, no adultery, six, do not break the rule...
He mentions only two of these punishments, the least and the most severe, and the rest of them are forced labor, copying, reprimands of the rod, face walls etc.
After these things were done, he and the family left the house of the hermit.
In the monastery, the monks in gray robes are the ordinary monks, those in yellow robes are the deacons of the monasteries, those in yellow robes and red robes are the abbots, the heads of the monasteries and the elders... Along the way, he worked tirelessly to impart the common knowledge of the monastery to the little shamis, until the Buddha and others entered the monastery of the Zeng Wu monastery, and he became silent again.
Walking, people turned away from the yellow wall, where there were green trees all around, and few Buddhist temples, and after a while, Menji saw an old, old courtyard.
Oh! you've got it so early. At the gate a big fat monk came up smiling and also dressed in yellow, but his collar was hanging open and his stomach was full.
He raised his brow, he could not hold back a bit: "You have no Buddha, how can you be so stupid?"
The fat monk, Fan Qin, who had long been familiar with the temper of Fan Qi, wasn't angry at all: "Oh, you are so obsessed with appearances, this is a disciple for our court? " He did not wish to quarrel with Fan Qi on this matter, and pointed directly at Mengyi and other humans.
She also asked her brother to arrange it. She answered correctly.
At this point, my mouth opened up, and he suddenly said: "Are you still in the courtyard?"
"Yet again". The fat man and the wise man hesitated. "What did you ask them to do? " said they, "did you intend to take them in vain?"
He shook his head and sighed: "My martial arts has been destroyed, how dare you deceive human sons, how dare you accept disciples?" "Fanxiang, you have to work to make them pay attention to the truth".
He was referring to Menji and Sheng.
The heart of Munchi had suddenly pulled, for the first time, to try to make his own way, and he wondered whether it really was true that the two monks had something special to help themselves.
"Rabbi, how dare I bother you with such small matters? " He replied", I have done everything you asked. "
He glanced at the hidden secret, did not say much, but told Benji, Chu Hui and others: "I will put you in the mixed court, because each of you has a problem, if you can understand yourself and practice your spirituality, you may not have the chance to enter the Wu monastery, the Dao, and even the Bodhisattva monasteries in the future".
But if you continue to commit the sins of immorality, greed, gambling, and debauchery, I will bring you to trial. I will not hide it, and I will punish you accordingly.
He put his thoughts out of his mouth without any disguise, without any selfishness, saying the old face of the old fool next to him blushed.
The boy answered, "Yes, Uncle".
When he came back from the meeting, he turned his body, and a piece of fat flesh began to roll up and down: he was afraid to see this ghost of an iron face.
The monk... dressed like a monk, looked straight ahead, and went into the Zen room, following the beaded heart.
This is your teacher. After he pointed to Menshi and Hiei, he turned around and went to another Zen house with the other little Shamis.
Inside the zen room, there is a bed for seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
Above the bed, two grey-clad monks, all in their twenties, lie together. The face of the man who was lying down is stagnant, silent, and the person sitting on the bed with two frown locked, cold tone: he packed his luggage and left it under the bed, wanted to drink water, and went to get water from the yard.
Mengch took one look at the wisdom of his wife and decided he should do the same and establish a good relationship with his roommates.
The person sitting there chides me coldly: "True, yeah.
After the response, he stopped talking and didn't even look at Meng and Huike, thus letting Meng stay close to the topic of their relationship.
As for the truth, close your eyes and go back to sleep.
What kind of people are these people?
Mengjie's stomach turned dark in confusion, but on the outside he smiled and said to Yuhui: "You are a good teacher, brother, I am sure, later you will call you".
"Yes, master. You have no difficulty in calling me.
Or this dumb little guy!
Munch silently groaned, and decided to play the part of a younger brother and help him: "Hey, little brother, I'll call you little brother. Come on, let's change clothes first".
Although there were people inside, Menji, who spent most of his time in the dorm room, was not discomforted, so he quickly removed his clothes and changed into a robe.
While he was quietly thanking the monk for his simple dress, which kept him from being unattractive, he was examining the things that had not been examined before.
This body garment, delicate and soft in texture, even though Mengzhi did not know the product, could be seen as very valuable, at the same time, his mother was wearing a piece of transparent jade dangling from his waist, and wearing a small jade dress tied with a red rope around his neck, pressed to his chest, cool and uncomfortable.
Menzhi carefully played with the finger-size Buddha Buddha, only to discover that his face was full of compassion, lively, and obviously beautifully carved, while at the same time, he felt gentle touching it, which was both warm and refreshing.
What did uncle Huang of horse-face say that the Buddha was a gift from an anonymous monk? But since the monk did not take it, it is estimated that it is not a strange thing, or better to wear it.
Benji hung the jade necklace on her chest and hid it, then collected the jewels, clothes, and other items and placed them on a couch of his choice.
At this moment, the sleepy Zhao Ziyi turned violently and sat up, put her shoes on the door, and looked at the Munshi one by one, not understanding what was happening.
She was still cold as the night. She said one word and got off the bed and walked out the door.
What kind of people are these two!
Mengchi yelled again, and then turned to Hua Hua: "Hello, teacher, is it okay? It's time for dinner!"
At the word of the wise one, the little figure came thundering to the door, like a rabbit, as if it had been very hungry.
So...if you're going to be a little nervous about something, are you the only one who is normal?
She suddenly stopped at the gate, looked back at Mengzhi with a puzzled expression and said, "Master, won't you go?"
If you have a conscience, wait for me!
Menjie thought for a moment, then half-jokingly replied: "Oh, I'm not as hungry as you are".
Look at you two, one by one, like a hungry abortion!
He turned and ran away.
After a few moments, he cried out: "Oh, brother, wait for me!
Suddenly a wave of sadness hit him, and others are his little sisters, and why I have only one little brother, and there will be no sisters in the foreseeable future.
Under a huge umbrella, a beautiful-looking woman, twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with a little boy, five or six years old, kneeled before the iron door of a luxurious villa.
The woman, named Kim Mi-Jin, from a remote mountain village six years ago was going to college with dreams and hopes, but she never expected to meet a man who would change everything for her: Li Zhe, the famous flower master of Baotou City.
It was when she was accidentally spotted by Li Zhe, who was at the same school with her and then proceeded to go after her, almost as if for a trick of his own.
She is the only girl who has just arrived in the city, a simple girl who is an opponent of this sex master, not only her body but her heart are completely given to him, but then after having played with her, she was abandoned by Liu Jie.
Later, Zhiwei found out that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth, but she and her family argued about it.
After the birth of his son, Zheng Meiyang had intended to raise him as an adult, but after five years, because his body was too exhausted to work, she was terminally ill and could not survive for several years, she finally decided to send the child to Li Family, wanting the child to feel father's love and have a better life, then she can also feel reassured after death.
However, this was rejected by the indifference of the Lee family, who did not recognize the baby as theirs, and Yang Meiyu was left alone with her child on her knees in front of the iron door, crying bitterly.
At this moment the iron door opened slowly, and a few people came out, carrying a torch, and the man who led the way looked like the little boy, his father, Lee Seok-ju.
Give it to me, stinking woman! The money will be enough to live well with. Li Zhe frowned and handed a check to her mother.
Yang Mei-ling shook her head, and looked up at Li Zhe, Tao, Zhe. You must leave your baby, he is your son!
Li Jie turned away and said coldly, "What do you want this money for?"
I heard that she had been making pears, and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe froze, and threw the check in his hand at Ye Min, and was about to turn around and leave.
Wu Mian, on her knees on the ground, clasped Li Zhi's thigh and said: "Li Zhi!
Oh, my God!
Before she finished talking, Li Zhe punched her in the face with a heavy hand and opened her mouth! You stinking woman!
The little boy next door saw his mother being beaten and ran over and hugged Lizzy's leg, with a childlike shout, 'Daddy, don't beat me!'
In fact, the little boy did not know who his father was from the beginning, and his mother did not mention him to him until this time when Yang Mi-chong took a picture of Li Zetze to the little boy, and the little boy knew that he had a dad, and was very happy and jumped up.
But now he doesn't understand why he doesn't sing, and he plays.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy who was clinging to his thigh, with disgust, one foot flew the little boy out of the room, and said, "Who's your dad, death!
The little boy was blown off one foot and fell to the ground with his body bent up and his face painful on his stomach, a pain far greater than a five-year-old boy could bear with a large ruby ball coming out of his eyelids.
Yue-Mei-Yi was amazed, too, and quickly unfastened Li-Jie, ran over to hug the little boy, and asked nervously, "Are you okay?"
The little boy looked at his mother's worried expression, closed his mouth, held back his tears, and shook his head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and daughter and went to the iron door, where a man with white hair, who looks like a butler, picked up the check and handed it to Yang Miyu before the sympathy advice, "You should save it, you know!"
She shook her head, holding the little boy, slowly disappearing in the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the mother's back, sighed deeply, turned to go into the house and slowly shut the iron door.
Four years later, before the death of Zhen Mei Zhi, she called the boy, who was already nine years old and had grown a lot, to his bedside, gently touched his head, smiled weakly and said, "My son, in the future you can read well and get a good job, and do not resent the Li family, nor resent your father, promise me well".
The little boy managed to hold back his tears and nodded seriously.
She looked down, and there was a calm smile on her face, and she slowly closed her eyes forever.
It was now nearly midnight, and the full moon hung high in the sky, its brilliant light shining on the earth so that there was no darkness around.
It is a new beginning.
Suddenly a deafening sound came out of the sky, and the little girl, in terror, looked up towards the sky, and saw the whole sky as if burning, transformed into a huge sea of fire, countless dispersed lightning of seven colors, dragging a long tail as if something like a meteor fell from the sky.
Oh, my God!
With a loud roar, a meteor with seven colors of light fell in front of the fire, its burning brightness made the fire explode in his hand, then the light dissipated, a single finger of long, two fingers of thick crystal quietly floated in the air two meters above the ground.
The dragon reached forward, and grabbed the crystal, which was floating in mid-air and was caught by a dragon.
At this point the people who had been asleep were also awakened by a series of loud noises, opened the doors or opened the windows, looked at the countless crystals floating in the air, and began to run out of the house in a frenzy to seize the crystals, and did not stay in the ground for long, hurrying back to their homes.
In the rented room, Liu carefully weighs crystal, if it is sold by the light, it has no gem that can be made beautiful, if the amount is scarce, the value is not even in the city, but the key is too much number of falling from the sky, not to mention tens of billions, so the crystal may not be worth the money at all.
The host is detected as a primary intelligence and starts to bind the souls...。
Ah! the soul binds successfully and begins on the journey to the world of enlightenment.
After this sound, she fell to the ground with two black eyes. Yanghong Dali, male, 22, an orphan, died tragically after saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. After the investigation, a decision was made by the relevant department to crown him a hero and a good university student.
You do not go, you don't go, so I don't have to go with you to the Hong Family to make friends! Dang Mu Feng buried his head in the pillow, desperately stepped on his white legs: Zhen Xin's power and strength were a famous waste in the whole city, and they discredited the family, and the elderly sick, twisted, and unable to speak clearly was a standard loser, so I did not look for such a person as my fiancee.
Tang Mu-Qiu, the only child of the chairman of the company of Dong Xi Pharmacy Ltd. Tang Mue Liuth, the multilingual and talented Bogeun now, looks like a flower and a face, a girl, gathering the spirits of the heaven and earth, and one, especially, burning a handful of good food, going up and down the hall of the standard, getting into the kitchen, the dream lover of many boys at school.
But today I heard my father say that he would take him to the famous Hong Dali family to make friends, how could she have taken this? If his parents had not fed her, a single seedling in the country would be such a waste, he would have been driven out of the family long ago and destroyed himself, what is the chance of such a chance to die in the house?
At her daughter's words, Don Ruiz, sitting on the bed, showed a bitterness on his face, saying: "Oh, I can't do it either".
What's your relationship with HONG, that your father decided that year, even though he lost his family a little, it's not a big deal, is it?
The figure of Don Ruiz in a bluish-grey leotard, with a stainless white sweater, a simple tie tied at the collar, a faded pip on the lips, an old bronze pipe in his hand, a black, short hair that was a bit behind him, oil shiny, the whole picture is quite good, but the eyes of the old God are now filled with helplessness and indifference.
Speaking of that, if he was not really pushed to go to the edge, how could he send his own daughter? After all, the giant, the human freak, the only thing he likes to do or said he would do, is two words: loser.
One of his most famous quotes is: "Honey, I have to lose the house, so that it doesn't waste the talent my dad earned".
This phrase is a laughing stock for the whole city of Tianjin, and many parents educate their kids by saying: "If you dare to learn from Hong Da-li, I won't break your legs!"
This is also why Don Mueang had so big a reaction, and it is only logical.
Oh, this is also... Oh Dong Riu Sheng shrugged his head and thought, and then suddenly his eyes lit up and said: Oh my God, what do you think of this? We'll wait for Dad's company to return to normal and then we'll find another excuse to return home. This time we are research funding is beyond the budget, once we have money, as long as this research project is successful, it will absolutely be a shock to the world.
The following post by Tan Mu: Qin Qin is easy to replace, but his company is one of the top 500 companies in the world, what could be that easy?
I have to say that she was a very smart girl.
If her house falls, her downfall is definitely not going to be so great. That's the way the world is, weak and hungry. When you are strong, no one may dare move you, but when you really fall in the middle of the house, people will definitely come and fall down the well.
For example, the young man who has been always picking on her at school, Sergeant Liyu, was a little more serious than her brother.
Therefore, Domu-chan cried for a while again, and finally realized that there was really no other way but this method, only to climb up reluctantly: Oh, then, try it first, oh, Papa, in the future you will never forget to quit, so that I won't marry that loser!
Wu Yun, good, for the sake of my family, my father is sure to go around as much as possible.
Hong Dail sat on the bed, his eyes narrowed, his mind puzzled.
The surroundings were strange and his memory was not working properly, and now he barely can recall the sound of the car braking and all that remains is some sort of mess that does not belong to him at all.
Oh, my dear, am I not dead, here, where? Looking at his white, thin hands, Hong Da-ling thought: "Oh, this is not my body, and this is not where I used to live!".
When he looked around for a moment, he thought: "The most important thing is to be able to understand the current situation".
(I am dead or alive right now?) (What is this place and who am I?) (What should I do next?)
Oh, now let's look at the first point: he forcefully pressed a small piece of oilskin in his left hand onto his back, and it hurt me. I have a feeling of pain, so I should still be alive. Oh, he touched his face, neck, ears, and head carefully. Oh, this body was obviously not my body before, but still within the human range.
What is this place, who am I? He looked around, at the concrete structures in the houses, the white-washed walls, all kinds of modern appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD in the corner of the room: "This is modern society, except for the stars on the walls around me; I haven't seen anything; I've never heard of any toys".
No one was around, Hong Ji-Li carefully stood up and took a deep breath: My body is so weak and thin, like a bamboo, I don't know when it will all of a sudden flare up.
Opening the computer, Hong opened a couple of web addresses, showing content quite different from what is on Earth, but at least it made him understand a few things: first, the text of this world or country, or the Chinese characters; and second, it was parallel space; many things are different from Earth, but very similar.
No identification documents? He thought about it, but he was immediately taken aback: Well, it seems that this body is not that old, about 17 or 18 years old, there are documents of identification that can be done, but the bigger one is not yet issued, after all, this world is different from Earth, some subtle differences are normal.
The loser system binding is successful, current rank: one.
For this, Hong Da Li suddenly gets in the middle of a small person, who appears to be himself.
Host name: Hong Da Li
Sexual capacity: 32  Note: For normal persons, each index is 100
Hong Dail looks surprised: Why the big loser system? Is this really fake?
At the end of the road, Hong Daili hates to commit suicide, and the metallic sound of the system resonates again. He explains: For every hundred thousand yuan (RMB) the host gets a property point.
When all the properties of the host reach the normal human level, the Super Loser system will be upgraded, at which time new items will be added.
Can you get attribute points? (at this point, if you really believe that there is nothing better than improving your own attribute, the eyes blurred to see the big smile of Hong, can you really gain attribute points through losing to someone who made you become like a normal person?)
The sound of the system is still cold, but you can hear it just like a song in your ear:  can
But Hong Daili almost didn't get up, saying "Oh, I'm going to waste my money, I'm going to lose the house!"
Then, ask the host to complete the first task: first loser. Task requirement: Loser at least $100,000 before 0:00 midnight today.
The current loser amount: 0.
Oh dear me, it's already eight o'clock at night! It's only four hours away, I can't, I must go out! I have to leave! Oh dear me!
Thinking about this, suddenly the door of the room is opened gently, and a maid of about forty years hastened in with a small gesture and said, "Madam, Mr. and Mrs. Wang are letting you pass, please come with me".
"Are you going to buy me a game of poker?" she asked with great anticipation.
Yang Zhaofei, now that you're in high school, you can't play games like you used to!
Oh dear, this is another game! This is an elaborate creation that Shenzhen Company has made for 13 years, called "The Second World of Man".
The game named Zhuhai Zhuhai, which Liu Fei speaks about is really another innovation in the history of mankind, it is not only a virtual reality game with a virtualized reality of almost 100%, but also a completely new technology that allows players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of quality sleep, but it can experience a completely different magical life for twenty-four hours!
The game is being promoted by the whole country, this game not only doesn't affect learning, but also makes for a better rest.
Yang Fei is still holding on!
He says, "Mom, for the last time, no! If you don't go back to your room in twenty seconds to do your homework, your spending money next month will be cut by fifty per cent".
You are so stubborn!
The low whistling voice of the owner was loud, but they also knew that there was no need to talk about it, because they were in good condition at home, the owner was absolutely not afraid to buy this game, but the owner's brains were rigid, they did not believe that playing the game would not affect learning!
When the teacher left, a little fat man ran up behind him, patting him on the shoulder and asked.
Never mind, I won't be able to play with you this time!
The brothers are all pointing at you!
This little fat guy is one of the few friends of Yan Fei at the school. He is a senior in school, and the ninth grade is the main school class. But his grades are average, he does not get up or down, he is not good in sports, and he is not very good at interpersonal communication, so he is definitely a standard transparent person.
My mother and father disagree, but what can I do? His eyes are blank, but he says nothing to his only friend.
The only problem is, because it's not the same as the condition of flying, they are the ones who are not good in all things, so the relationship between these two transparent people who are not the focus of their teachers and classmates is very good.
The road to self-comfort.
I wish!
He nodded.
Liu Bei from childhood loved to play games, especially this virtual reality game, as a boy, who does not want to fight Swordsman? A man with a three-foot sword, standing tall, this is every boy's dream, but in times of peace and high-tech society, let's not say no war, even if there is a war, it is also by pressing a button, so if you want to enjoy the war is hot blood can only go to experience virtual games!
But this time, Liu Jie's hopes were dashed, and since his arrival in high school, Liu Jie's boss had made him entertainment restricted by the Chinese government, and his entire home gaming devices had been seized, not to mention online games.
It was now around six o'clock in the evening, and because it was already winter, it was very early in the night, when he left school to go home.
Thinking that today is the day when Liu Qingyuan was naked, Liu Fenghe locked himself up in his room! It was almost ten o'clock, and Liu Fenghe also finished his homework, he was lying on his bed on his back, looking at the one o'clock position of the clock on the wall close to ten o'clock, something was not in his mind.
The opening hour of Zhuang Zhongyuan is 10 p.m. today, and then every day from 10 pm until 6 am the next day, running eight hours a day, neither delaying the normal life of the player, but also allowing the player to have a full 24 hours of game time! Wow!
While he is flying he is consciously rubbing his fingers on the ring on his index finger.
What the hell kind of game is this?
The old man looked at the ring on his hand, and his mouth was opened, he was shocked and lost his speech!
Whoa! Whoa.
A white light flashed, a flower fluttered before my eyes, and I waited until my eyesight came back again to normal, and then it was no longer my room!
Welcome to the world of the shining sun! The newest assistant number 34784 is at your service!
A crisp, female voice in the ears of the flying!
This is the landing interface for the Phoenix Falcon?
So this is exactly where characters create interfaces! says the new assistant.
In the meantime, it is hard to imagine that they don't have a game, how could they get in the game?
Maybe that's just your dream! Maybe you are too tired to do your homework, so you lie down in bed and sleep, including the mysterious ring thing just now which is probably a part of your dream, thinking about it day and night and maybe you want to play the game too much!
You are a liar!
One angry scream, followed by the sound of feet stepping on the asphalt floor and running away.
Zhang put his hands out in despair: "I am not a liar, I'm a college teacher... I just want you to be my student!
After a day of drinking the tea, remembering what the political head of the school had said, Zhang frowned and said, "Today is my 17th year! If I don't get a single student in today, I will go home tomorrow!"
But not a person of this world, but the caretaker of an ordinary university library on earth, who only remembers the fire, and then... then no more, wakes up again in this world.
As we are told in the novel, martial art is honorable, and power is the king!
I thought I could cross a wasted forest, and be divorced, and then fight back, singing a song all the way... It seemed to be more than that, I found out here that it was not a student at all, but... a teacher!
One of the most grieving teachers in the whole school!
Other people's classrooms are full of people, so crowded that they can't sit down, and in his classroom, there are none, so he can't easily drag them into his classroom, but finally he shouts and curses at the sucker and turns around and runs away!
The reasons were that the guy who was dressed in his own soul, the weakest of teachers, also had very poor eyesight, the pupils couldn't even see, the key... and taught wrong, there is an example of going to hell!
This hospital, as dead, is ruined, scorned by men, and even new disciples, a venerable one, withdraw from it, for fear of falling into his hands, to be taught that half-dead and not alive.
No students, and yet they are sick, last year the whole school was ranked first and even got the only zero score in its history.
In the midst of misery he borrowed wine, and at last was hanged by any of his wishes, and he borrowed the opportunity to pass through.
As the new term began, he received a final warning that if he failed to enroll a student in his class this year, he would be fired from his position!
Today 17 new students walked past his classroom, and as a result, all ran away as soon as they heard his name, like a girl with a strange face and how fast he ran.
It seems you'll have to find a way to ignore one of them!
I was trying hard to figure out how to open the door when a girl with a dumb face opened the door and unlocked her head.
Hi, is this the classroom of Luo Zi's teacher?
The voice is sweet, adorable, beautiful, and lovable.
Teacher Lu Zi, the star teacher of the college, the classrooms are always packed with talent, and a lot of people are there.
There she is, and there is a man throwing a net, and his eyes are bright!
Remembering all the ways he had been treated in the past life, he sat quietly on the throne, in a posture of a gentleman of nobility: "Do you want to call him master?
The girl nodded like a sparrow, her black eyes were filled with admiration: I heard that Lu Qi was the best teacher at Hong Tian Academy, and that the students he taught were extraordinary, everyone was proud to join his classroom!
What your master talks about is good enough, it does not fit with your theory of cultivation, not only does it not progress, if it does not do well it will even regress. The teacher is not famous, and if it fits with your theory, you can also make rapid progress and improve!
That's how it works...I have heard my brother say something like that, too! The girls grimace, and the beautiful twins look confused: But, I don't know what class I fit into!
He saw her, she was shocked, Zhang raised his eyes, hesitated for a moment, Marx, Enko and other pioneers appeared in his mind, with a difficult look: You meet each other by chance, it is so, I am also a teacher of the college, I can help you see the roots, talent, and integrity, and help you recommend a suitable teacher.
The teacher, whom the girls had not expected to meet, was so generous that the girls were excited and nodded their heads.
Please show me how to fix it first!
Zhang's eyes were half closed, he didn't seem to care.
It is!
What a surprise!
The moment of kung fu, the fist blowing through the room, the air rushing over the girl like a dragon, and the whole person's breath, uninhibited and unexposed, represented that she had an excellent foundation.
Well done, I see that you usually study hard, your foundation is solid, your talent is excellent, and you are a rare genius!
He studied this with the Lord of Earthly Destiny, and the words are all gold and silver, wide-ranging, so that one can not hear mistakes, but implicitly accurate.
The teacher was crying, my leg was hurt, and the doctor said it was nearly gone... The girl interrupted him and there was a question in his eyes.
Yang Yang was injured... and his face was red, but his face was so thick no one could see and he continued ranting: "You think I didn't see it? I knew about it when you exerted your strength! That is because... the rock is not broken!
But they were all silent for some time. Then the other disciple began to speak.
What's the chance? What is the chance? The girl's eyes lit up.
After she injured her leg, she was always feeling inferior to others, self-absorbed, never thinking that there could be blessings from calamities.
This is the chance that you can soar to the sky, it is not enough to be the first to be born, after all, your gift is good, is the eternal genius of the universe, but...
She then heard that she could be the first born and that she was a genius, she couldn't control her eyes, but then she asked, "But what?
But... Yang Zhang sighs, a good student is about to be buried: there are not many teachers in the whole college that could see this fate!
She had great hopes when she heard this, but her eyes fainted slightly and she wanted to know what was going on and jumped up: "Well, they don't accept students, the teacher... doesn't accept them?"
"Of course, I will pay it back, but as you can see, I don't have that much time!
The phone!
When he had finished speaking, she fell at his feet and said, "Sir, I know that you are a wise man, and an honest one. But just ask him for me to be your servant. I will be careful not to make you lose face".
They didn't have to do anything at all, the student made sure not to disturb the teacher! He looked a little unwelcoming and the girl nodded her head, all sincere.
I have few students, I may not have the resources to compete with other teachers, and I am subjected to criticism...
That's it...I heard that exercise is important...the girl hesitated.
In a school, where the teachers receive resources based on the number of students they teach, and the number of classes taught, the progress of the training will be very difficult if the resources are not enough.
Knack, I purposely said this to test you, since you are firm in your heart and sincerely think of me as a teacher, I find it hard to take you down! Seeing her hesitation, Zhang immediately interrupted, hurriedly said: You have the identity confirmation!
This is... so soon?
The teacher suddenly changed her face like a book, the speed of the anomalies, the girl was slightly startled, then the token was handed to represent the identity, she was considering whether to check, but then there was the teacher, who had been waiting for the first time, had pulled her hand, pulled out a pointed knife, and a drop of blood fell on the card.
Whoa!
The light is flickering.
The girl is crazy.
So this teacher said, why don't you think about that? how can you move so fast, and... the knife is ready?
From now on, you are my student!"The blood drops, but Zhang Feng is breathless and reassumes the appearance of a great man: "What's your name?"
Teacher, my name is Wang Yang!
Knowing that nothing can change that, the girl stopped talking, and she nodded her head.
Oh, take your ID card, go get your blankets and books, find a place for yourself! Tomorrow is a formal lesson, come and find me!
Zhang waved his hand.
Ah yes! The king nodded and turned and walked away.
You missed the last one!
Zhang was relieved to see her become one of his students, and smiled a little.
And it is not easy, and if not for all of the pretense-making techniques on the web, today it would be even more difficult to succeed.
One student, who had been spared the fate of being expelled, was relaxed and at the moment felt his whole spirit go easy for a moment, and the desire for the previous person that was floating in his head was also slowly vanishing.
If it has crossed you, it will live for you.
It is believed that Zhang Hang died because he could not recruit students, but at this moment he had students, and the last perseverance also disappeared without a trace. Up to this moment, Zhang Hang is a complete master of this body.
The sound of thunder!
After having mastered his body completely, Zhang Sushi felt a tremor in his brain as he tried to ignore the students, and the sound of a yellow bell was heard.
The sound of thunder!
Every kind of language, some tears that throbbed in his head, a huge palace appeared in his mind, with the five great letters gleaming on the top.
The library of Heaven!
They walked inside, and there were countless shelves, an endless number of books, and their eye could not see the end.
Nimah, I am a librarian all my life, will not be born to this world, it's the same!
The grand gift of other people, not the boss, is the system, all kinds of good things that are forced to explode, while they are a library, Zhang Hang felt that there was only darkness before his eyes, that it had almost not passed.
What's the library? What about a bird? Will we fight, then, others throw swords, and I throw books?
What kind of books are these?
Desperate, Zhang reached for the books on the shelves and reached across to see if the library was useful, and saw his hand reaching straight down to the shelf and grabbing an empty space.
Why should you give a book to a library, but you don't get any books?
Zhang looked speechless and wanted to cry.
Chapter 1
What about my tattoo?
Yi Yi opened his sleeves and looked at his two blond lips in astonishment. Before, he had two fangs and claws on his cheeks, a green dragon full of breath!
What... all gone?
He looked up and found himself sitting in a brightly lit office with little partitions in front of and behind.
At this moment, the phone is ringing, papers are flying, and more than a dozen clerks are running around in a hall, all looking pretty confused.
Meanwhile, a middle-aged man in a brown shirt comes quickly to greet the crowd, and the leader of the band of bending women tells us about the case of the electric baton rape, the action starts tonight.
Some people hurry to bring me a white board with words and some pictures.
After hearing the greeting, many members of the staff rushed over the perimeter, pulled their chairs and sat down in front of the whiteboard and listened intently.
He did not move, but remained seated on his throne.
Now he was in a state of shock when he touched his right ear, which had not been damaged since it had been cut in half by a small bolt in a fight.
He looked for a mirror to see his own face, but instead saw the picture on his desk; a young, handsome guy in a police uniform who looked exactly like him!
Grandmother Bear! Shocked, a strange memory flooded his mind like the Yellow River. It was only gradually that Liu Yue realised that...
Liu Yue remembers well that he was the golden champion of the Qinglong Gang, a monkey king who battles to save his life! Although his name is Liu Yue, people in Yangzi Lake prefer to call him Liu Xiaoyang!
Grandma is a bear!
Once again shocked, Yu Yan remembered that he had already been executed with a drug injection!
But, remember... how did you get here?
Did I really cross the border?
This is the reason for the fact that there is no connection between these two and the resulting birth is not reproduced in any way.
As his new memories come flooding in, he's surprised to discover that this is a parallel world similar to the one before him, and his current identity, an agent of the Serious Crime Task Force, is a cop!
Now the hall where he is, nowhere else, is exactly the office of the police station!
He could not believe his own eyes, this big gap was hard to imagine. A senior policeman who turned into a major case officer is... what's the point?
He unconsciously touched his head, which had been shaved with a knife, and his hair grew out unevenly. In contrast, he had a bald head, the appearance of evil beings. Now, though he had a black head, his appearance was like that of a handsome boy.
Hello colleagues, Since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of electrical rod rape in my city... At this moment, a woman detective with short hair and big eyes is telling the story for people to hear.
Yangyu soon remembers the information of the agent. She is the leader of the heavy crime group group B. Despite her age, she is well-behaved, her case solved rate is high, and she is the red person in front of the leader. In general, she will preside over all the big cases that require the cooperation of the whole team.
The victims were young women dressed in fancy clothes and had lifestyle issues. According to the head of the gang, the crime was mostly committed near trendy places such as bars, music halls, and even after midnight.
According to the victim's testimony, the perpetrator followed the victim into a tunnel without a conductor, electrocuted her with electric batons and then raped her. After the attack, the perpetrator would spit on the victim.
After hearing the words of "Cesar", the scene was silent.
This man is the deputy captain of the special crime group, Yangcheng Huang. During the training of Zhengzhou, this man was a part of the family. Every day, he was asked to pour tea on him, as the messenger was called to the next person.
But in this world, Zhao Yue wasn't a monkey king, but a big boy with a weak personality, who just finished his internship to become a police officer. Not only Zhao Zhao, many of his older colleagues, made fun of him by giving him jobs that shouldn't be his.
Now the juice is not soft, so how was it allowed to be swallowed? He struck the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled the chief, and even the leader had to stop for a moment.
And who knows? Just when all the people were turning towards the vase, a voice like a silver spoon suddenly snapped in front of it, and just then a girl with a horseshoe, lean and fat, dressed in large glasses appeared before the eyes of the people.
The girl is the new intern assigned to the Major Crimes Unit named Li Ben; the girl is a flower girl who was not contacted for a month and was seen dead by Zhao Yue.
Although Yang Yao's character is weak, often bullied by people, he looks like a human being, with a head of 1.78 m, a windy, young and energetic, and a certain lethal ability to deal with the opposite sex.
At that moment, seeing that the man she loved was drinking and drinking, Li-Beni hurried to the front line and said: "Captain, I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm still an intern, these jobs are of course for me!"
After she finished, Li-Beni smiled and ran to the tea room in the hall to pour a cup of coffee.
Even though he has already been shot, his memory is very clear, because only a few minutes earlier he was still lying in the death row. In the previous world, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, he knew that he had been set up, not to be murdered. The man who had been killed was the owner of a property group, and he only struck him with a blow, by the orders of his superior, and it could not be death.
And even if he did beat someone to death, it was still manslaughter, not murder, so his death was a conspiracy.
The thought of all this filled the lips of Zhiyu, and his fist was shrieking. If he were to later find the person who had betrayed him, he would pay them back double.
By this time, LiBeni had cooked the coffee and gave each of her co-workers a cup to drink. The little girl's face was filled with enthusiasm, and each time she had a cup, she would kindly encourage her co-workers by saying something like "you worked so hard on your pump".
Officer, there are two bags of sugar in this cup! Tonight is supposed to be a day of awareness, but you should hang in there!
After waiting for the reaction of Yang Yi, Li Beiyi put the dishes away in a big way.
When the chairman of the Qu Yuan Group had finished discussing the case, he changed to speaking to one of the members of the "heavy crime" team, Captain Jin Zhenb'an. Captain Jin is over 50 years old, white and black, and he is a very serious old man who is very serious.
Captain Kim is said to have raised his voice, that there have already been three cases of electrocution, so the next one will be classed as a series of incidents.
So, everybody, get your heads together and try to crack this case in the shortest possible time! That's it...the A team sent one to investigate the crime scene, and since the culprit was following the victim, he must have appeared in the bar music room where the victim was before, and called all the surveillance there, must find this person!
It is!
Captain Ming ordered, there is no basis for the murder of the criminal, the blood doesn't follow the line. However, the murderer's urine is an important clue, although the police can't find a match, you can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check the correspondence, as long as the person has done a physical examination or was hospitalized, you will surely find him!
It is!
Besides, the electrical rods used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal at the scene, and the only victim who saw the appearance of the criminal, these clues cannot be ignored, but they all need to be followed up by the police.
It is!
All right, all the teams make a plan of action, if there is no problem, then go as soon as possible!
Wait, I... I have a problem!
When they heard this, they turned around and saw a man speaking to him in a dream.
Commander Kim was quick to ask, "What happened to you, Yang Yue? What's wrong with you?"
He pointed to his forehead and said, "I don't feel well, go home and play yourselves".
Chapter 1
21st century, Office of the Dean of the Senior Private Hospital of Dong Hai City
In one fell swoop, a thick case is thrown on a table, the Dean of the Lyceum is gray in his face and can't be bothered, Han Han Jian, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Ling Yun Group, he owns 40 percent of our hospital, you must give him priority to detox!
In the face of the dean's anger, Han Jiajiang put his hands in the white building's pockets, very calm. Dean Jiaqing, I'm sorry, Mr. Lee's in chronic snake poisoning, I'm not allowed to join the line for non-emergency circumstances.
She looks pure and beautiful, big eyes, a pair of small pears, young and light is known to Chinese medicine with amazing acupuncture talent, is a rare master of detoxification, whether dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or toxins in the human body, are her strengths.
The director of the university was furious and started to shoot at me.
Don't tell me that all doctors are equal, but there are only men and women. Han-jeong, I tell you, organize your detox now or get out of the medical world as of today!
I thought that Han Jun-Yin would be scared, but she was still calm and serious, Director Zhong, there is no difference between men and women in front of me, there are only two types of people, those who I want to save and those who I don't want to save, Mr. Li, I do not save, please please help the Ko-Ming!
When she finished, she smiled politely, turned, and walked away, appearing elegant and thin, but her attitude and quiet beauty showed a kind of arrogance that could not be ignored. However, when Zhao Hanzhen opened the door, the dean was furious.
How dare you talk to me like that, you have helped me!
He said as she was handing the case from the desk to the back of her head, Han Jian nodded a little and felt a warm humidity trickle from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Tiananmen.
Han Ji-jun woke up in a fog from the blossoms to the sounds of cheering, the sound of the drums, and the darkness in front of her eyes.
What happened?
Han Han, looking down the cloth that had been on her head, breathed his last breath. Is this... not Shepa? She looked at herself, and then she saw that she was dressed in a crown, like a bride getting married... drunk!
The flowers burst, making Han Hye Jeong get a headache, and the moment when a strange memory flooded her mind. No doubt, she crossed the line, and when she did, she was going to marry!
The original owner was the niece of the medical family of Tianin and Han's nephew, also known as Han-Jung, because the mother's healing saved the life of the then queen, who is the current queen, and was married to the seven princes of the time, i.e. the current King of Song, Dong Fifeng. This was also passed on as a joke, and the rank of the Han family has risen as a result.
But no one knows that Han Jiazhuang's mother died shortly after their birth, and then she grew up to be a scumbag who had no knowledge of medicine, and that the marriage was a taboo for the king. The last days of the marriage, the king was annoyed with the emperor, and the emperor had given a decree that the marriage should be finalized by the end of the month.
King Long was the only surviving king to claim the title. Young and only in his early twenties, he is currently the only royal uncle, the first person of high status in the State of T'ien-Ning.
The imperial castle in the south of the city, the Han family in the north, and the flowers passed through the city from north to south. The royal couple married, even if he did not show his face but was emboldened, and the whole city was shocked.
While Han Yeon-joo was sorting out the details of these memories, she stopped to listen to Shiba's crying and said, "It's not good, it's not good, it's not good!"
Chapter One
Xiao Yu, Xiao Yu, get up. It's almost 0:00 in the morning, get up and eat some chicken.
Yuan Yu felt the voice was strange, but very friendly. He faintly answered with a sigh, opened his eyes and saw a young face that was only in his memory.
What?
I woke up, and went to wash my face. I said: Don't drink, you must drink, go to sleep without looking at the spring. Qin Danyin said with a smile.
Is this New Year's Eve?
On the right and on the left of the maze, he saw a little cabin of not more than six square meters, a single bed with patched covers, an old wooden table, a 20-watt incandescent lamp on top, a dim twilight glow, and old newspapers on the wall, on which he had forgotten some of the country events.
This isn't the old house at his family's farm when he was a child, but the house was torn down long ago when the town was built, and how did his sister get to be so young?
When he raised his hand, he knew it was definitely not a joke, because his hands were getting smaller, and his arm was thinner.
He leapt from the bed and stood on the edge of the door frame with the mark that he used to make every New Year's Day with his knife: the top row, in 1988, 166 cm.
It is 1988, and he has not completed junior high school?
He thrust himself, and almost cried out in pain, 'Is it not a dream?'
Wu Yi opened the door, and his mother was cooking a ham in the kitchen courtyard. He lived in a small house outside the kitchen, on the other side of the kitchen was the living room, a hall on the farm called the house room.
When he woke up, he drank wine and no more. Zhang Xianghua looked at his son with pity.
Yu Yu looked at his mother with black hair and wet eyes.
Well, you worked hard.
What do you say, young man! Quickly wash your face and go home and watch TV, you'll soon be fine! Chang Xiaoling heard the words, and he was very glad, because his son is grown.
When Yuan Yuan saw his father sitting on the living room bench, his lips were moving. The day before he was able to earn money, his father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and died less than three months later, without even spending a penny on his salary.
The family had been waiting for the baby, which made it very hard for the temple to maintain the relationship for a long time.
Dad: Yoon Sook Tjin looked at his son and said, "Can't you just watch TV, let's go to the national dances, we'll celebrate".
Mommy, Daddy, I want to have a drink with you for a while longer. Mommy saw the anger on your daddy's face and explained that it was okay to have a beer.
He hadn't had a few drinks with him in his life, but now he has a strong desire to drink with him again.
I don't have long memory, go, drink a little more, I see you can get up tomorrow to go to New Year's Eve! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer
Xuan Daiyin shook her head helplessly, turned to get the beer and the glass.
The chapel also has a single bed with a blanket. Dandan Yin went to school and stayed with his mother on holidays, this bed was used for his naptime. However, three years ago, Yang Yun was still asleep.
There is a three-door locker and two leather cases on the west wall of the living room. On a solid wooden table, a 14-inch black and white television is displaying Spring Evening.
There is a folding round table in the middle of the living room, which is already full of dishes and bowls. There are a total of eight dishes, but they are all left over from the evening. There are soups, fish and elbows, and the eight dishes are all cuisine, not one of vegetarian dishes.
Instead of watching TV, Yu Yu went to the front of the wardrobe and took a good look in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can now be certain that he was reborn!
She quickly cooked the coconut, and both Liu Yu and Zhang Tanin went to the kitchen to help the coconut, and after the four of them sat down, Zhang Xintai picked it up.
Liu Xiaojun, you are still drinking! Liu Changhua looked at the temple.
Oh, next year, let me have some more!
Zheng Qingtai also said two words, and Zhang Xuanhua shook his head and left them. Zheng also poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, who also served in the temple, because they must drink together as a family.
Father, mother and sister, Happy New Year, to you!
This year, the world has no longer had to deal with hormonal additives. Fish, ducks and all are wild, and chickens and pigs are homemade. The two ate these dishes, and the ducks, one drank a bottle of beer, and there was no more excitement.
And when he had eaten his breakfast and washed, he went back to his lodging-house, laying on his bed, and turned back his face, and could not help thinking about his former life.
Yang Yubin, a middle-aged man in his forties, made his own investment after resigning from a stock company.
There is a wife, but no children, his father died in early life, and his mother lives with him.
He remembers the spring of 2015, when he had to take his wife overseas for her infertility treatments to make some extra money, and he borrowed a large sum of money from all his family savings, including a house and car, and put it on the stock market, which, according to his presumption, is a bull market, and jackals could make money.
The first time he was very well-off, his investment soon doubled. Then he was daring to use a high leverage in an investment company to get more profit, and then he doubled again, and he was able to do nothing for the rest of his life and also to eat and drink without worry.
When the stock market climbed to 5,000, like many people, his greedy belief that he could continue to rise, the stock market began to rise a little, but the stock market soon came to the rescue, because he used high leverage, and no additional money, but instead lost a lot of money. After paying off the loan, he became broke, his wife did not know that the house and car had been mortgaged out, and he did not know how to go home to meet his family.
He broke down, drank a lot that day, and then intentionally, under the watchful eyes of many people, accidentally fell on the road and was hit by a truck.
That shouldn't have been considered a suicide, he had taken the accident insurance that should have saved him millions, enough to buy back the house and car, and leave a little money for his mother and wife.
He remembers looking at his truck and thinking that if God would give him a chance to come back, he would not die of such a painful death, but would give his family a comfortable life!
But I didn't realize that God was really giving him a chance to come back!
Since God sent him back, there will be no regrets in this life. He will become very rich, a legend in the investment world!
Do not cry, go to sleep.
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Zhaohao called out. While complaining about her husband, she was making her son drink at night. It was nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaint, Yue Yu laughed and laughed, rolled over, and fell asleep. Chapter One
Monday, May 20, 2019
Spring is over and summer is over.
In this season, the temperature in Jiangnan province varies greatly between day and night. During the day, the sun is shining like the sun; but at night, the sun is shining like the moon.
The city of Jiangnan University
He was alone in the dormitory, and the computer table was pulled to the side of his bed so he could watch movies in all the different postures he was used to.
It's no coincidence that last night, when it got quite hot in the middle of the night, he called out in his sleep to a pair of sea-dragon, and the duvet flew off.
In the middle of the night, the temperature dropped drastically. When the only book under his body was a small piece of paper, he was struggling to navigate, his hands in sleep groped hard on the bed, looking for the blanket, but he could not touch the blanket. He finally shriveled into a fur-like fleece, and shuddered under the scorching heat of the midnight wind.
As the sun rose, Yang was already a member of the seasonal flu army.
His roommate has already requested a day off for him today.
Then, he took a cold medicine and slept until now.
He was in a terrible state, had a high fever and was still quite emaciated, so he couldn't go to school at all. Therefore, he was left alone to watch boring movies in the dormitory.
On the screen, the film progresses slowly  But the content of the film, Liu Buiwei has not looked at it at all
Is the leukaemia not over yet, it is a pity. He gasped and felt his eyelids heavy.
The chat software in the bottom right corner of the computer jumped.
This is a suggestion to add him as a friend or to join the group.
He waved his hand slightly at the bottom right corner of the screen to indicate that he wanted the message to pop out.
(*******) Please add you as a friend. ]
Huang Zhanxuan? Who is this strange nickname?
Is that a classmate? He's writing a novel and thinking of the other smart kids in his class who have gone to college but are still in the teenage fantasy phase. If it were them, he would have called you that odd nickname.
Thinking of this, he nodded his head in agreement.
Soon after, another system message popped up.
[Huang Sanjin invited you to join the first group of the group of Kyushu.
The company then agreed to do so.
The Kesuyama Pressure Tower has agreed to join the Kyushu Group One.
[You have agreed to join the group, so say hello to the group members!] A smiley face has been added.
In the beginning of the year, the chat tool was more and more humane.
After a series of tips popping up, Liu Shuo turned off the tips and group chat window, and now he is sleepy-eyed, where did the energy go to add to what group he added?
Anyway, his group has been set up to have popups only show the number of messages, and the group chat doesn't pop up to bother him, only show the number of chats after the group.
When he has sobered up, he can look through chat logs to see which group he has joined and the chat logs of the group will not be lost.
The movie is still going strong, but the consciousness of the "book-trip" is getting more and more vague.
In the first group of Kyushu, after seeing someone new join, the diving members of the group began to lead. North River Walk: Yu Yuan Shan has added a new fellow to the group? No new people added for more than a year, right?
And ID quickly responded to Ms. Zhou's question: "Do you have a new friend?" "Which area are you in?" "What's the street number?
What is wrong with this series of questions, and how is there something wrong with that?
Are you a fairy? Yes, it's true, be a light!
Brother Yang, are you really a goldfish? The North River people said: "If you die again, what will you do if Mr. Huang really comes in with another big throne?"
This guy is all good, sympathetic, helpful, so he is a good person and usually likes to talk and work to death.
Every time the unfortunate and lowly person is killed, the culprit is always the big front man. These big front men with their eggs aching are saddened that there is no fun, and naturally they are happy to fold the mad sword three waves of the fun sent to the door.
He kneels down and begs not to speak to me again, for it is a shadow in my heart. The three waves of the mad sword sent out a wave of tears filled my face.
Four years ago he was beaten up badly by a beautiful and great forward...he had been beaten by him for a whole year and four months. You heard me right, it was a whole year and four months! Thinking of that inhuman, crazy year, his tears were moist.
When he had thus spoken, there arose out of the multitude two or three of the worst scoffers who were not hidden from the people, but who were glad and glad.
The group had eight people online, six of them showing up with a row of smiling faces.
Oh you, my friends of misfortune, this meeting remembers each and every one of you, do not let this meeting meet you, otherwise you will have to taste the suffering of this meeting's seventy two-way knife!
The third wave of the Razorback just ended.
He's so advanced, he's reached the level of queen of five, and he's only two steps away from the sixth king, but he can only hit seven.
His 72-shot sword is fast and agile, and his body movements are like lightning, but he can only shoot the A-7.
He called his sword "Mad", and when he got mad, he was afraid of himself, but he could only hit A.
When the crowd saw the three waves had stopped, another unbridled smile appeared.
This time, the three waves of the Wrangler could only make a series of startling cries.
The people were silent for half a day, but they did not see any new arrivals, some wondered.
"You're not a new friend, are you?" the back-street guy in the North River asked.
Unfortunately, due to the effect of the cold medicine, she has gone back into a half-dormant state.
Sudie H7 was happy when he sent a message: "I see the new path of my friends is called Shushu Mountain Pressure Tower. Have you ever heard of a high-ranking person with this name?"
Think back, the people who walk in the temple are more comfortable than the Buddhists, not only are their mouths pierced, but their fists are also hard. And when it comes to excitement, the people also sang songs to stimulate and cheer up!
Yoon-a Seven, I said, your expectations of your new fellow disciples would only ever be good and bad, and to be good and bad, right?
I feel sorry for you.
"Is he going to be another great football player who does not use chat tools?"
When he said that, the whole audience was feeling that this scene was very immediate.
Yes, almost four years ago, it seems that there was a former co-worker who shut down after more than a hundred years, was also hardly able to access chat software and was joined by Huang Shanxin. But, because he can't type, he doesn't speak.
Then one of the guys called Razzakzai Trina, who was very happy to chat with the former champion, asked the former champion for a report, asked her to send pictures, and to voice chat with her.
Then... a few days later, Ryuji Tsunawa saw it first hand. He was as beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
After a year and four months of fighting the fierce waves of the blade, the beautiful striker left with a happy heart.
At the time, an I.D. called 'Yong Farmer' spoke.
This is the last page of the post, and it was posted by the editor.
The people in the crowd seem accustomed to the short talk of the pharmacist, as if he were asking where is the king of the crowd?
Briefly speaking is not the nature of the pharmacist noble and cold, but because he typewrites with two fingers Zen plus handwriting, the speed is slow. When the number of words is easy to miss, erasing and writing is painful. So the pharmacist is accustomed to speaking shorter.
He immediately went down after adding people, and he heard that his family's favorite demon dog had left the house, and Huang Shanxian went to chase after him again. North River strays.
The pharmacist.
So I have to wait for my new buddy to learn how to use the chat tool.
All the other members were among the first, thinking that the new members were also in the middle.
About an hour later, she regained consciousness.
You know that person who recently added the group to the group, and said it looks like the group K1, is the new group? He whispered, and with a little help, opened the chat tool in the bottom right corner and pulled out the chat window of K1.
What kind of group?
Soon, the record of a chat from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
The booklet was probably visited once.
Chasing the big dog?
This is a special vocabulary in various fairy tales.
It is also very interesting how the members of the group talk. It is half antique, half unethical. The impression is given that the modern people are trying to communicate in the ancient language, biased also because the roots of the ancient language is not uniform, resulting in different way of communication.
He laughed out loud.
Looks like this is a bunch of Marvel fans?
This is no ordinary crowd of Marvel fans!
Everyone in the group has their own street name, and the place where they live is called Cave City; and the dog who lost the owner of the group describes the big demon dog who has left the house. Is there someone who claims that he has not played the trumpet player for 100 years, that is, that he has been alive for hundreds of years?
It is a shame just to look at the chat logs.
This obsession has reached the level of the secondary disease, and is the second of the fables, with a lot of Warashi characteristics.
It looks like a concentration camp for the mentally ill!
This was his first impression of the first group of Chippewa and its members.
But why include him?
He looked at the profile of the deputy leader, Huang Yanshan, who is not his classmate and he certainly did not know him.
The thin lines of blue extend smoothly from the tip of the pen. The pale blue lines on the cards, which are of palm-size, continue to add and add, the pattern of a complicated bassoon becomes more and more perfect as the tip of the pen slips.
Suddenly the pencil sharpened, but the light was reversed, followed by a sharpened side-spike as sharp as a knife! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, immediately faded out, and returned to normal.
He is still focusing his face as he finishes the card, and he has only made fifteen, ten steps short from today's task. He is now working on a one-star energy card, one of the lowest in the energy range, which is one of the most widely used and consuming cards currently.
At this moment, the room was suddenly dark.
The number on the meter indicates 100. The power is suddenly exhausted and it seems that the task for today is to have an extra one. Back at the desk, Chen Zhengxun devotes himself to work, whose entire livelihood depends on this most paper-grade card.
Chan Zui's room is very small, less than forty square meters, inside is a half old desk. Besides the table is still relatively clean, the room elsewhere piled up piles of litter everywhere. These are also scrap five or eight doors, piles of old books, various raw materials scattered.
Chan stayed in this modest place for three years. This was an assisted living facility set up by the federal government and a small room like this, which was available for only one hundred and fifty Odins a month. For poor people like Chen, there was nowhere more inexpensive to live.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Xuan finally finished his work for the day with 25 cards. Carefully counting the number of cards and counting them twice in a row, to make sure that there was no mistake. He carefully packed his cards in his bag of clothes.
As he entered the door, the owner of the shop noticed him and greeted him, "Madam, Ajun is here!
He responded to the owner. Uncle Hua, the owner of the store, was an old man of around fifty years old, and the years had left traces on him that he could not hide.
Chen Choi carefully pulled the card from his sleeve, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shop owner: twenty-five
Huang uncle picked up the card from Chen Huang, without looking it, put it on the shelf, smiled and said: "Thank you to Wu Huang for sending me cards every day, otherwise, I would have a shortage of supplies here. "
Chen Qiu chuckled, but did not reply, he knew that what Hu Chao was saying was a joke. The one-star energy card is one of the cheapest energy cards but also one of the most expensive, what's more, in this area near Dongwei University, where only 25 energy cards can be sold in a day?
He did not speak nonsense, he directly asked him, "Do you need cash or a transfer?"
Chen Chong replied simply, and afterward handed a prepared pale green decayed copy to Uncle Hua. After finishing his farewells, Chen Chong wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Wa suddenly called to Chen Zhong: "Wait for Chen Zhong".
Chen Chang stopped walking, turned and looked at Uncle Wang a little surprised: "Is there anything wrong, Uncle?"
Huang took out the yellow-orange paper from the drawer and looked at Chen Ming, "You almost forgot something". This is a note to a teacher training class for card makers. The dealer brought it with us yesterday.
When he saw Huashan's kind face, his heart felt moved. He knew how much the old man had helped him, and if it were not for him, he believed that life would be just as unattainable for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned how to make energy cards, sold them everywhere, but people were reluctant to ask, and no merchants were willing to buy them. The amount of one-star energy cards required was very large, and merchants preferred to purchase a large quantity of them once.
He had a chance to meet Uncle Wang, who agreed to buy his energy card, but the purchase price per card was 103.00 Yuan, which was two Yuan less than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. However, Chen Chang remained grateful to Uncle Wang.
While the price of 113 ODI was lower than the price of 105 ODI, Chen felt an overwhelming sense of joy. He sold all the energy cards he had, bought the cheapest food, and then all the rest of the money used to buy the ingredients for the energy cards.
Since then, Chen's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty five energy cards a day, without a day off.
It took him three years. During these three years, he made just one, the first-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time researching ways to reduce costs.
In the end, in the third year, the cost of the Energy Card was controlled by him at 95 eur, 8 eur for each Energy Card, his daily income was steady at 200 eur, a figure that he could not even have imagined three years ago.
Chan Huan Xiao Hua came to the Lord, and said with a smile, "Thank you, Uncle Hua!" He took the card from his class and carefully put it in his briefcase.
These often carry splendid advertisements, such as a listing certificate to confirm that the DTH recognizes the Master of Advanced Studies degree awarded by the DTH, and then, what exactly is in it. The only thing the institution doing this training course has in common with the DTH is that the institution must give a fee to the DTH every time to maintain the prestige it has to hold the joint courses.
Yet Chen Chen has always intended to listen to what is being told in his training. Making cards is one of the hardest subjects to learn, and he has not given up learning by himself for so many years with only slight effect.
For the young man without a shred of foundation, it was a natural challenge to learn how to make the hard-to-find and well-known card-making. However, he had no doubts about his own intelligence and was able to learn how to make a star-rated energy card in a week, using only his memory, and was praised by the card-maker of the year.
From then on, he put aside this goal, which was temporarily too high for him, and began to learn the most elementary theories. He took time every day to learn these tedious knowledge, no matter how tired he was from work.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Wang, Chen Zheng moved to the south along a small road. It was Saturday, and he had work to do.
After walking for about twenty minutes through two streets, he came to a station with a second-hand, discarded postcard.
He is also the owner of the buying station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, he works here for three hours at the shop.
He nodded his head slightly, but his face was still a little bit grumpy.
Chen's rude face is familiar to him. When Chen came here to ask for a short-time job, he had declined. This acquisition station, since the beginning of his father, has always been a man, and has always been handled by him.
However, after Chen Zheng told him not to pay, Mi-yeon finally agreed. Of course, Chen Zheng was paid, and usually he would take a few scrap cards with him as his wage.
Sometimes Chen Huong would choose some unused energy cards from the waste piles, but every month he saved a lot of money by calculating the bill. But he was curious about the silent Chen Huong, how did this guy know these energy cards had any extra energy?
But since then, he has been smiling and frowning every time he sees Chen Yue.
Chen Shuang began to classify the discarded cards he had piled. There were many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, figurative cards, and even some rare plant and animal cards.
The work proceeded quickly and it was obvious that he was very familiar with the task.
The second star energy card can be used for a while longer. This second-star energy card contains at least half the energy, and Chen Zheng does not understand why the original owner of this card would waste so much energy. The capacity of the second-star energy card is a thousand, which means there is almost five hundred energies in it.
He looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, and his eyes opened with laughter ▽ He ran to the meter and inserted the card, and when he saw the 523 number, he smiled and almost all five senses were squeezed into one.
Three years' production work gave him his own understanding of this most ordinary, lowest level of cards. There is not only one way to make a 1-star energy card, but he has collected twelve different kinds of energy cards from this.
Chen Zhou was inspired by these differently constructed one star energy cards. Because he learned the skills of creating these cards, he was able to reduce the cost of making one star energy cards to 95 OOD. However, such luck does not come every day, and so far, he has only collected twelve of them.
But today the luck seemed to be on.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, from the surface texture, he is a type of Chen Zhen who has never encountered another type of new structure.
He put that energy card aside and proceeded to look through it. The number of one-star energy cards was very large, but Chen Cheng didn't bother to check one. His speed was so fast that it would take almost as long as his hands were touching one of the one-star energy cards to know if it was what he wanted.
This comes from his familiarity with the Star Energy cards. This familiarity is the result of three years of work, and he does not need to see, but simply can judge by the feel of the hand if the card is a Star Energy card or a structure he has seen. He is so familiar with them that every detail of them.
The fingers from the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Limbagh got confused and climbed out of bed.
Her head was drowned as though it were not her own, her palms touched the exquisite bedsheets, not the old-fashioned, washed one she usually used, the one on top of her head, not the half-broken, energy-saving style of the lamp she had been accustomed to seeing, her body ache as if it had been torn open by something, and she lifted her wrist, with the blue and violet markings on it clearly visible.
She closed her mouth to keep her voice from being uttered and she opened the blanket, and saw herself, with no inch of skin inside it, with the scream almost coming through the closet.
The eyes of Lingling twisted, the drop slipping under his eyes, he rolled over his covers, got out of bed, gathered his messy clothes, put them on, and ran out in front of everybody else.
Ohhh....let go of me, you let go...Julian's hand and foot are struggling together
The strong hand of the man pulled at her neck, and without any effort, led the man back to the bed.
His deep eyes, as with a born arrogance, upon the cold and frosty veil, the nose, as high on the white face, the skin, as white as a ball, made even the woman who was asking herself whether her skin was fine envious.
She asked herself how many men she had seen, but those men who were called the men of the Gods, when they came to her, all of a sudden turned pale.
The man who spent half the night last night beating her half to death?
"Who sent you, that you should give me the medicine? Do you think you can leave without being harmed? " He looked at this foolish woman and his anger burned in his eyes.
The strange woman, her skin more than snow, her face small and fair, her great moving eyes, and her feathers sparkling like the feathers of a frightened deer, was staring at him with an unfeigned beaming look.
Gujingze's eyes fixed on her, and once more Lin Yi's eyes followed the rapid turn of her brain.
However, she was mistaken.
The people in front of me, although they look like tears, but clearly they are not the superstar.
This time she was again grabbed by his rough arm, and as she fell to the ground, she even rolled a wobbly circle before settling down again.
You screwed up, now I'm the one who is damaged. Her butt hurts, her hands ache, the pain under the pain is more than anyone can ignore, she is on fire, she just threw it out, I am in love with someone else, I do not have anything to do with you, you think you deserve my medication! My grandmother is not random, you return my medication!
Are you lost?
Gu Jin-se's face was tight, the brows were the same, and the black eyes were like hunched animals, staring at this disheveled woman, her clean white half-crossed shoulders out in the open, marked with purple and scarlet hair, and bright eyes that opened up, as if a flower of the rose had been opened on the pale skin.
The images of the night flashed back into his mind, and he felt a sudden burning sensation in his lower abdomen, and again the manifest fire-heat rushed through his body.
I looked away from her face.
And this damned woman had the nerve to give him a pill that was so powerful.
He hesitated, and then Lin Lin finally had a chance, and after all that, jumped out of bed and pushed him away with her own strength.
Without looking back, she hurried and ran out.
When she heard him, she turned to look and saw the rest, and looked at herself.
Oh my....Yinhui Jingzhe was about to turn to grab her, but felt the body for a moment, the bottom was raised again uncontrollably.
He yelled, clenched his fist to restrain the bloody ******.
A series of voices coming from outside.
Looking back, her surprised lips were uncomfortable.
"What was that? how could a woman run out of your room with her clothes all messed up?
He lifted his sharp eyes, the black eyes gleaming brightly, and let the mouse hurry to digest all the undue doubts into his belly.
She kept washing her body in the bathroom until her skin was pink and she cursed at the mirror, "Wow, wow!".
She was worried that if her mother came to visit, it wouldn't be a good thing.
When the bathroom door opened, the pretty lady stood outside, astonished to see the bed full of filth.
Those who haven't come and picked up their beds are clearly telling everyone in sight what happened last night.
"Oh, I know what you want to ask, but mother, I'm busy today.
She looked at Gu Jingze, she pointed at the bed and said, "Gu Jingze, I already know that you have a relationship with a girl".
He pushed the door open and asked, "Are you going to handle this?"
How can I be indifferent to you, Jinji, you have to marry her, and you have to take responsibility for the daughter of everyone?
Mother, I will not marry her, I am not crazy, she is just a strange woman, I don't even know her name.
Mother! Mother! He stood there, and thought of the woman, but became even more agitated.
Are you still thinking about that little girl Mo Hwi-chan? I told you that it's not possible, you have been with her all these years, can't even touch her, and you are definitely not meant to be together!
Mother, that's enough! Zhao Guozhi wanted to interrupt the late show.
But that is a very emotional time, Yu Yajin-zae, you know your disease, you can't touch women at all and at home, we've almost prepared artificial insemination for you to have a child, but you touched a woman today, that is the most suitable one for you!
The name of the city is Zhenzhou, and since ancient times, there are countless strange people and heretics in here, the so-called "grass serpent and secret dragon snake".
Countless myths and legends, like a thick cloud, cover the city with a shroud of mystery.
On the small stone paths in the mountains, in groups of men in blue clothing with three branches of frankincense in their hands, they walked quietly and fast on the path, running towards the high mountain behind them, up into the clouds, smooth like a mirror stone wall.
The mountain roads are damp and the dew is wet, but these people have passed fast, carrying the red stripes. Then some jumps from time to time, flying over the wind, over the distance of one hundred meters, the morning wind blows, clothes dance, then the moment of the moment, as if the gods were coming.
From the hills and the peaks of Qingdao, from the viewing towers of the great palaces, people were continually traveling and gathering before this nameless stone wall.
There are a large group of little men with flags and weapons, carrying incense burners around the whole front of the Nine Houses. The smoke rises straight up into the sky, and the foam spirals upwards, becoming a cloud over the top of the group.
In front of the crowd, under the stone wall, a group of people wearing golden purple robes, silver wire on the chest and back of the chest, the edge of the sleeves of the robes with clouds in wrinkles and laurel flowers, with beautiful peasants all around, with hands of cotton dust, stood without expression.
The crowd waited in silence for a while, and when a red light suddenly arose from the east, and split open all the heaven in a red flash, the multitude of those in the street all prostrated themselves in unison, and in the pillar of piety they knelt and made a great offer to the stone wall.
Thousands of devotees chanted the mantra simultaneously, and the thunderous voices of the incantations merged to create a tremendous, small wave of sound that went far and wide. Gradually, a strange force rose from the incantations, and a bright seven-colored torch of light shone from the top of the many devotees and on the smooth, clean rock walls.
The disciples who were dressed in gold and purple and fell on their faces at the same time and said a prayer with their lips closed.
And when for half an hour, finally a white light radiates from the top of the stone wall, soon the whole stone wall emits pure white light.
The smoke rose from the sky, the countless clouds of smoke covered the stone walls, and a few shadows were hidden around the golden light of the people around the crowds of the people appeared in the cloud. The human shadows became more and more clear, and finally three men and five women dressed in white robes, their faces were covered by golden light.
The woman in the middle looked down at the crowd of people kneeling before the stone wall, and suddenly had a scroll in her hand, which she threw out with a fork.
A flash of white light was seen on the stone wall, and the purple scroll woven of axle gold threads slowly fell on to the old man in purple robes, who was leading the crowd in worship in the front. The woman who threw the scroll said a few words in her voice and turned to leave with several companions around her.
The elders in purple clad suddenly cried out: "Father, have mercy, have mercy!"
The ringing continued, and all the passengers with their heavy bows bowed their heads to the five men and women, and their heads rocked.
When the woman who had thrown away her scroll heard the cry of a cold drink, all the passers-by fell on their knees, and dared not speak any more.
The other woman, who was near the woman, laughed a few times but then threw things back at her.
When the stone walls became dark, the five men disappeared without a trace.
How strange and gleaming things gradually fell from the sky: a sword, a bead, a small candle, five charms and nine bottles of medicine.
Swords, beads, and small axes are small like children's toys, but each is bright, flickering with smoke, and clearly something extraordinary.
The five chords are even more golden than light, the violets are forceful, if there is no pressure, one wave after another surges from the chords, and those who are a little closer to the path are unstable, and are pushed back by the force.
The nine bottles were engraved with colorful symbols and seals. As the old path that ran to the roll opened one of the bottles, a clear medicine chest suddenly sprayed from the face of many of the passengers, and thousands of people in front of the stone wall at the same time took a deep breath, feeling as if they had been washed clean, they all shone around.
The simple smell of the medicine was worth more to them than three months of the disciples' toil. The old man in the purple robe was busy closing and sealing the medicine bottles tightly. The mere smell of the medicine had such a magical effect that one could imagine the treasure of the medicine in this bottle.
Some of the purple-robed elders muttered together, gathered up swords, beads, axes, medallions and medicine bottles, and then opened the scroll in front of the crowd.
The first half of the scroll is a verse that praises the spirited spirit of God, but the second half of the scroll is the face of the old men in purple robes, who all shouted in terror. About an hour later, countless people from the Qinghai mountain swarmed.
The potential of the city is seen in the secular world, rising an invisible giant wave.
Chapter 1
As a result of the intense heat of July, the asphalt road under the scorching heat of the sun emitted a pungent smell of paint, a look that was about to fade.
The road surface is straight and twisted by the evaporated air.
On the streets, under such a toxic sunshine there are few pedestrians, even fewer cars passing by, and everyone is looking for a place to spend the summer in the shade or in the air-conditioned rooms.
A woman in a bright orange white shirt and a grey suit was rushing straight to the Second People's Hospital.
The hair is very tightly tied to her face by the sweat, and the woman's eyebrows are abnormally red, an obvious result of sun damage.
The white shirt was wet with sweat, and it was uncomfortable to wear it tightly, but Jia Chen had no time to think about it, so she grabbed it in her purse with 100,000 yuan in it.
This is the money that she sold all the valuable things around her, hard to earn, her sister had a surgery and paid $200,000, and $100,000 to figure out how to do it again.
As they went to the room, Zhao Yi's hand touched the door handle, and she could hear the conversation between the mother and daughter.
Hey, it's all Joe's fault, if it wasn't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me.
Don't cry, your mother has already taught you a lesson.
She was standing outside, her sister was not being caught because of her treason but she was going away with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
The thought of Chen Jun, Joyang's eyes lit up a little.
Chen Jun was Jo Jo's boyfriend, but she became pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child, and Ding Jia Bo said that Jo Jo was the culprit, and was an unconscionable small animal who stole her boyfriend from her sister, and also forced her sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Choi Seung only withdrew, and Zhang followed his sister.
Oh my, the army is divorcing me, and my children are not with me, and I have this disease. What should I do? Oh, I don't want to die, I haven't fully obeyed you. I really don't want to die.
In the hospital ward, Jo's mother hugged Ding Jian Ye and cried very much, she was so young and still had a lot of good days ahead of her, she really didn't want to die.
Ting-Jian is very touched to hear that her eldest daughter has such a grave illness and to think that she is to be a good mother to herself in the future.
Dingjia slapped Choi Ji-chan's back: You won't, you certainly won't make you anything. You've collected the money for you because of that dead man Choi Ji-chan.
Soon after her divorce from Chen, Chen suffered from kidney failure and had to change her diaper.
But in this marriage, Jojo is the one who has been guilty of adultery, and then Chen joined the government and was expelled from the household, and now she's sick and has no money to pay for medication.
After hearing this conversation, Jojo, who had known that his mother was a bigot, was filled with pain.
She was 40 years old, and since her breakup from Chen Yun, she didn't speak about love again, not because she didn't want to, but because her mother wouldn't let her do it.
Most of the money she earned over the years went to her mother who used the money she earned to buy a 150 sqm apartment for her sister, whereas she could only afford to live in a rented house for a few tens.
She pays for the meal and water bills at her parents' house, and her sister pays for the electricity every time she comes to her house, although she comes with something in her hand, but she makes more when she leaves.
She was not allowed to get married, but people joked that nobody wants her. She doesn't know that her mother didn't want her to get married, she just wants her salary.
But this is her own sister, who, every time she fell in love with someone, she died trying to survive, but she couldn't do anything.
After years of hard work, in the end only three words were given to her, especially because she also blamed herself for her own cheating on her divorce, and she grabbed a hundred thousand in her hands, and suddenly didn't want to give it to JoJo anymore.
It was not until after JoJo's departure that she heard a conversation that she was truly terrified and desperate over.
What if Jo's brother had raised 200,000 but couldn't find a wife? In fact, the doctor said that if one of my relatives would donate one of my wives to me, the match would be much higher, less likely to cause rejection.
Reaching for Jing Yi's arms, Jozo said, "If you are really a relative, maybe I can save a little money on my illness".
** Some people would not wait to die to get a chance like this!
Knowing this, Choi Jin-su knew that money wasn't enough for her to live, that she had to think of other ways to survive.
"Do you want to go for a blood test or not?"
The girl didn't even shake her head, her mother was the same age, her mother wouldn't be anywhere better than her, if it were necessary, she would definitely want a good one: Mom, you are my mother who raised me, I can not force you to use a knife, my father certainly can't do it either.
Shana...Ding Yi Yan thought with light in her eyes: Wait until the dead head arrives, I let her get a blood test, she is your sister, definitely fit!
You may have to say so, but wouldn't Joe say so? After all, this is a joke.
To survive, just in case, she would never let Joshua have the chance to reject her.
"Miss Choo, you come and see your sister, why don't you come in? Choo Choo's mother was chatting with Jingjia's mother, when outside the door came the voice of the nurse.
Oh... the conversation that she had with her aunt was overheard by the dead man, didn't it?
Ding Jianxiu didn't say a word, but got up and chased out, saw the back of Jo, and then shouted her name.
When Jo Ye heard Ding Jiayiang's cry, she refused to look back or stop, and her tears continued to fall, but her heart was shattered in pieces.
For her mother, her sister, she doesn't even have a house of her own, yet her mother says to her sister that she doesn't have enough money, and now wants her daughter.
Dingjia did not understand what Jo's mother had to say, but Jo understand it, the more she heard it, the more Jo hates it, even if she really owed it to Jo's family, it should be enough!
Jo had a headache and was just trying to tell her that it was dangerous on the high street, when a car came towards her.
There came a noise, and Jo couldn't say anything. She was in pain, but she barely opened her eyes to see how her mother was doing.
Ding Jia Wu was really scared when he saw his daughter lying in a pool of blood, so he ran over and said: 'Hyung, it's okay you're dead, at least you can help your sister at least you're still dead.'
A girl was beaten to death, and the person who hit her must be paid.
When Zhou heard what Ding Jianqiang had said, he blinked his eyes and stared at her until she died, waiting for the ambulance to arrive to take her alive!
Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that in one moment you dream of paradise and the next moment you find yourself in hell.
He was in his classroom two months ago, dreaming of going to a prestigious university, but now he was working a menial job in the sunny industrial areas.
Thinking of his misery, Mo Tsui-tzu spat on the ground, raised his arms and rubbed the sweat from his face. He had just lifted a block of a car, and his back was now covered in sweat.
Don't ask, a teenager of seventeen or eight, with an ordinary face, dark skin, slender figure, and a pair of somewhat calm eyes. Perhaps children in poor families are early to come home and not old enough to make people seem somewhat young and older.
The cement truck loaded with bricks went to the side of the road and, without asking for a cool place to sit down, at this time there was no head, it was a good time to sneak away. In the dull and busy workplace, it is very lucky to be able to sneak away anytime.
He was sitting in a large gold knife on a slab of cement, and his eyes were fixed on the road, and soon his eyes lit up; the road turned against a mysterious shadow, and at once it caught his attention.
Even though the distance is so wide, you cannot see each other's faces, the body is absolutely attractive, and the walking posture so graceful, like a professionally trained model.
Don't just look at the women walking, there is a lot of education in there. And don't sit around all day on the job site, on the other side of the road with a sidewalk.
He seemed to recall something, he pulled a blue metal disc from his breastplate, the size of a coin, with a small blue iron chain tied on it like a strange necklace.
And what is not surprising is that a few days ago, during the demolition of an old house, he discovered a piece of an old frog, a frog pit, damaged and estimated to be a hundred years old, in a wall.
If they are 100 years old, they may be worth a little money, but a frog, even if it is an antique, may not be worth anything at all.
When Mo asked about this, he threw the frog on the ground, but did not want the frog to break apart from it, from which a piece of metal fell out, and it was the strange necklace in Mo's hand.
The blue metal disk is strange, divided into eight areas on the disk, engraved with various odd symbols.
Although not familiar with the artifacts, the objects in his hands were what is supposed to be a miniature version of the gossip bowl, which ordinary people would hang in their homes as a symbol of good luck, as an offering for charm.
While he's not superstitious, he doesn't believe in the ability of gossiping to get away with murder, but he also knows that this ancient gossiping dish should be valuable, it could be an antique and if sold to an antique dealer, it could make you rich overnight.
Mo-shu's eyes filled with longing, touching the gossip collar was like touching his lover. Once he became a rich man, the great beauties, who had previously only dared to peer from afar and swallow water in the dark, did not let him pick.
Something is wrong. Something is wrong!
I have a problem! Call an ambulance!
A loud shout was heard from nearby, and many people soon ran there, shouting and at the same time interrupting the beautiful dream of Maos.
He looked around in doubt, hesitating, but he got up and ran into the crowd.
As he glanced around, he saw the circumstances in front of him. For nearly fifty years, a middle-aged man in a dress was lying on the ground, convulsing continuously, with his face pale, his breathing wide, and his hands close to his chest, and it seemed very painful.
From his eyes, filled with a deep fear, seemed to be felt death.
Many of the fellow workers arrived, but no one dared to step forward, a group of workers of less cultural background did not know what was going on and did not dare to act without warning.
I have a heart attack!
He recognized at once the disease of the old man, because someone in the village had recently had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes, and he witnessed the whole process.
His village is very remote, there is almost no professional physician in it, usually a patient who is sick is treated by the simple formula he received from his grandfather, and there is no targeted treatment at all.
While his mother is very sick, labor-addicted and there is no doctor in the village, his biggest dream is to study at the most famous medical college in the country and in the future become a doctor who helps his mother and the people in the village to cure diseases.
Unfortunately, after failing the exam, he got his qualification in the University of Medicine of Warsaw and qualified for free admission, but he was replaced by a son, who is an influential member of the family, who is clearly lower than him, but instead pushed him down.
Although his grades allowed him to get admitted to other good schools, the expensive school fees were beyond his means, and to avoid adding to the burden on his mother, he had no choice but to give up school and work to earn money.
The site is located at a suburban development, very far from the city, the nearest hospital ambulance will take about 25 minutes to get there. Can you believe the way the patient looks and keep on for 25 minutes or two?
This man was a friend, he lived with him in the same workshop, and was called Zhao Xie, because he was an honest and honest man and because he had no skills, he could only do the lowest level of work on the site.
It was reported that he also has a son who is studying in college, and he works so hard to earn money for his son's college.
Mo asked hesitantly looking at a coworker on the ground, who dreams of becoming a doctor, with some knowledge of some simple common pathologies, but for acute myocardial infarction, he knows several first aid measures that can alleviate the disease.
But who at the end of the year dares to save anyone? It is good to save nature, but if you save a sick person, two or three times a year, the responsibility might be laid on his head.
This is the reality of Navajo society, perhaps it is possible to take some emergency steps, to alleviate the condition, to delay the death, it is possible to save a life. But Mo Shuo, like the others around him, is afraid to go and help.
He took a deep breath, was a little silent for a moment, and then finally sighed as he walked toward the sickly old man. He was not a bad man, but he had a good relationship with him. They were poor rural people working for him, and they understood each other's difficulties.
Don't touch him, I'm a doctor.
A beautiful group of people rushed from far and wide, all the way through the messy site to the scene of the crime.
A minute or two later, the unconscious paused, a gust of wind hit him, and a great figure appeared before him.
There was a girl, with the best appearance and stature, less than half a head shorter than Mo Mo, with a flower of rice white, a white flower on the ground, a pair of thin white legs. She ran, she moved her clothes and moved the people.
Mo asked, not able to control himself, he peeked daily at the young girls who passed by his workplace, but it was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl! A natural sculpted color of perfection kept coming to his mind! No powder, but amazing.
He found that the white girl was the girl from across the street he had had sex with on purpose. Now he knew that she was not only beautiful, but had a great face too.
The girl ignored the questions, immediately went down to check on the old man's condition, and soon the beautiful face changed, and it appeared that the situation was somewhat serious
As we know, the patient was in shock and the situation was not optimistic.
Can you help me?
The girl looked up anxiously, asking the distance to the patient, and it was the first time she found him.
I can do it!
He didn't think that a girl would ask him for help, but he quickly responded and hurried over to her.
Can you help me flatten his body and slightly raise his legs?
Mo Tsue Ban soon realized there are ways of relieving myocardial infarction, and soon did as the girl said. He knew that the girl was right, raising her legs was to prevent the brain of the patient from losing oxygen due to shock, which is the best solution, since there is no oxygen pump or other device.
He suddenly found himself a little cocked on his chest, and becoming hot as if there were a red-hot piece of iron sticking in his chest. His face changed, and he unconsciously reached to his chest to find that it was the chattering dish dug out of the blue box.
An Lin was standing on the top of the tower, facing the noise of the wind.
The wind blew, the sense of weightlessness that suddenly fell, even if he was already unlovable, and yet he was afraid of yelling.
The fear of the coming death gripped every part of him, making every part of his body tremble.
In that moment, An Lin's whole body was suddenly enveloped in a mysterious white light.
The horrible feeling of hyper-gravity was felt in that instant, and he felt as though he had been ridden in a chariot, and he had run to the bottom, then turned an arc, and had flown up into the sky.
The screaming continued, and his body fell back to the roof of the house, after flying into the sky.
With an unbelievable sense of weight loss and the alternation of life and death, An Ling felt a twinge in her head, and threw up without a moment's hesitation.
Hello, little one, how are you? At that moment, a shrill sound came to Anlin's ears.
He looked up and saw an old man who was looking at him with a loving face.
And the hair of the old man shall be white, and his sinews blue, and his whole body red of gold, and the likeness of holiness shall be without blemish.
When I saw the scene, my whole body shook and a lot of thoughts came into my mind.
All sorts of plots began to emerge in the mind of An-lin, the beginning of all the dreams, is not the scene before you!
The phone!
He shook his head with gratitude and said, "Shanxian, thank you for saving me!"
The old man, who was called by An Lin the Fa, gently caressed his white beard, smiled and said: "O young man, you deserve a great birthday, why do you prefer to choose easy life? "
"My mother died early, my father was greedy. After my father sold his house, he owed millions of yuan in debt and could not pay it back, and then he ran away alone!"
How many millions! What can I get back?
After that, I was forced to drop out of school and work for the debtors.
She whispered in his ear, thinking that life is nothing but black and blue. She spent her whole life paying off debts. What is the difference between her and a whale, it's better to terminate the pregnancy a little earlier than usual.
After listening to the story of Lin Lin, the Xian man had sympathy in his eyes and slowly opened his mouth: "Young man, your life is so terrible... so, you, I met, and I think you are qualified, let him send you a set of system of yoga, let you change your life".
An Lin heard that he was having problems, thought it was a lucky break to be able to make contact with a fairy, but did not expect the fairy to be so brave, so he sent the system at once!
"Sir, you have been very kind to me, and I don't know what to do in return.
The fairy smiled and raised his hand to the sky, and immediately afterwards a white ball of light appeared in his palm.
Hey, little guy, you come and hold this ball of light in your hand.
Rumour has it that An Lin is excited and can't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light in his hand was emitting a warm stream of warmth, and the light that flowed from it was soft.
"The system is moving. The Xian's slowly say".
As soon as the faeries spoke, the white light globe was sparkling!
At this moment, the Sikhs said to An-Lin: "Young man, you will take an oath and swear to accept this system and not to forsake it for the rest of your life!"
The war god system?
A good name!
But how is that a declaration of marriage?
Without giving much thought to the question, the old man hurriedly said, "I swear, I will accept the God of War system, and I will never give it up!"
As soon as An-Ling finished his oath, the ball of light came crashing into his body and became one with him.
Next thing, a voice rings in his head: "Tang detects that the host is physically a celestial orb, qualified, and the system begins to merge!"
She was so excited that she wanted to cry.
I thought that my life is gray but did not think that I should be able to turn back and now, at this moment, I have the life of a system!
The elves are too excited, and they were so excited that they cried!
"Oh, how are you, Mr. Xiang, are you okay?" he said curiously after seeing the elder's strange behavior.
The Elves returned to God, wiped away their tears, and knew that they were insane.
"When you get the system, you have to fuel it. "
Oh, I will!
So, do you want to go to a nunnery school? " the nun asked.
Why should we have to be the nuns that refuse to go to a convent school?
Oh, I especially want to be a nun!
Anling opened her mouth to answer almost without thinking it over. She smiled, pulled out a piece of gold paper and handed it to Anling, and said, "That's my letter of recommendation. If you have it, you can go to Confucian Union University to study and start on the path of Confucianism".
The elves prepared for themselves, the way of the proud sorcerer, the way for the dragon to come back home.
He accepted the letter of congratulations from the Fairy Sage, and looked at him gratefully.
An Lin was very curious about the fairy who gave him a newborn.
The name of the bird is... Don't even mention it. The falcon caresses the top of An Lin's head and his face is the color of compassion.
I have to go, guys. Bye bye
The elves say goodbye to An-Ling and leave in the mist.
A prayer of thanks to the elves who flew towards the sky, Wu-Anlin.
The fairy's laughter came from the sky, swift and wild, as if it poured out the breath of life's sorrow.
Why is this fairy so happy, how can he feel happier than me?
An Lin was confused.
At this moment, a woman's voice resounded to Anling's consciousness: "Hi!"
The voice of the woman was beautiful, like a swan, and she could hear Anling sounding like a ghost.
Is this the sound of the system?
He was surprised.
At that moment, an interface appeared in An-lin's mind.
The interface is a little gray with a few words: War God System feature will be activated when you enter the mainland.
What the hell is the First Continent?
An-lin thought of the greeting letter the elves gave him, and with great expectation, he spread out the golden paper in his hand.
Then, he found nothing in the golden paper, only a slightly embedded handprint.
Anling, for some unknown reason, still managed to put his hand on the paper and matched it with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper was a golden glow, and the Anling had just a small surprise, and was completely engulfed by the golden light.
Then An Lin felt the sky turn for a moment, and the horizon went from being dark to bright again.
Then he found himself again in the sky, and began to land freely.
An Ling was once again experiencing a feeling of being jumping from a building, the acid refreshment, no matter how many times it was, he wanted to cry.
An Lin hardly looked up, then saw a scene that he will never forget.
Two white-stamped columns, up to two hundred feet high, stand in the sky, on the base of which are carved signs that he could not understand.
After the gate, the palace is thousands and thousands of miles, endless.
And the clouds were round about the house, and all the beasts which were flying in the midst of the sky, as if they had been of great stately form.
An Lin stood there, his face a shade of shock.
This world is a wonderland!
An Lin tried hard to calm down and let herself calm down.
After a while he saw a woman in a robe running up to greet him.
Hello, fairy sister. Yang An Ling waves his hand to the woman.
When the beautiful woman saw Anling waving to her, she walked over.
An Lin asked with some excitement: "Oh, beautiful fairy sister, what is this place, I first came here, but I don't know very much about this place ".
After hearing the words of An Ling, the woman looked strange, and then said: "You are the chihuahua?
Oh, what are you talking about?
The woman shows the same expression as An-Ling, opens up: "What happened?"
An Lin was blinded in that moment, and a horrible speculation arose in his mind.
Miss Zhao, can you speak Mandarin? The tears are wet, please.
A beautiful woman has her hands folded, and some are angry.
The language is out.
What is she saying? I don't understand her at all!
In the end, An Ling cried.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Around one platform, hundreds of people gathered, shouting and cheering, and surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most visible part of the car is the two cars that are about to start.
One is the most expensive pink Ferrari 488, worth more than four million, and next to it the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth half million, and the two cars together form a clear contrast.
This is the match between the newly elected General of the Chinese Army, Chang Feng, and one of the top four commanders, Zhang Han.
At the Ford Field, Zhang leaned silently against the car door, his clothing was rusty, his hair was long, and when he lowered his head, he covered his eyes, and people could not see his closed eyes, and his chin with a dagger from his lower half could be seen.
And Tan, in the crowd on the right, his face, like the moon in the stars, as if to say that the world is under his feet.
Let's see how high the roof used to be.
He waved his hand, and with a cold smile, his head went past.
Who is Mr. Zhang?
Did you fall asleep? The previously immortal Major Zhang is now like this, the game is about to start, what is cool? Oh my Major Zhang!
Look at him now, he looks like a poor man!
I don't think he deserves to eat, he's not allowed to eat pork for a living.
On the side of the Ford Mustang was a fat man in glasses with a three or four year old kid's head at his feet.
The girl had the long powder head jade, dressed in white dresses, and the delicate small face is like a lovely princess in a fairy tale, except for the hair is messy everything else is perfect, but at this moment there were tears of resentment in the big eyes of the little girl, listening to the crowd's account of Zhang Han, and she seemed to be about to cry.
If you were to set a small-headed, cute figure in ordinary, estimate would attract a lot of attention, but now it is time for a one-man show at the Peak.
After a flurry of teasing, Zhang Han finally has a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes for a moment, he was stunned by the actions of the people in front of him, and his eyes were filled with a sense of contempt for the sky.
And who will dare to bark in front of his dignity?
Suddenly the words came out of Zhang Han's mouth:
The entire arena was silent, but the next moment, a laughing-stock with a hint of irony was heard.
I think you are crazy, aren't you?
I was afraid of being turned into a monkey.
The crowd again laughed, but Zhang Han stopped when he saw the picture in front of him.
Hey, isn't that when I was riding the Wolf Mountain and the Peak Race in 2009?
Why am I here?
Am I not stealing from heaven?
Oh, did I... did I come back?
I was born by the thunder of the 9th Heaven's god. The trembling flashed in Zhang Han's eyes.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, Zhang's family was one of the eight great families in Beijing, and Zhang Han's father was the head of the family, so Zhang Han was never afraid. But once the family had a plane accident, his parents and sister were killed, and two uncles were the head of the family.
Zhang Han was beaten and mistaken for a victim in the family, so he started a private investigation of Zhang Wu, who always hated his father, but was discovered by Zhang, and eventually he was expelled from his house, along with many other people who had been guilty before Zhang Han.
It's been over five years, Zhang Han has not wanted to leave, he always wanted to find things out, he had a hard time but always stuck to it, until this time the incident of the Wolf Walk Mountain.
Remember that in the beginning of this mountain race, he was seriously injured in an accident, he lost his arms, he was crippled for five years and finally jumped off a cliff, he didn't think of the accidental entrance to the world of monks. When he began to contact monks, Zhang Han was awoken by his talent to smell a treasure smell from a certain range of treasures.
With the help of this divine medium, in five hundred years, Zhang Han's hard-earned wealth will be amassed by all kinds of treasures, to the maximum,
Why not five years ago?
Zhang Han's face raised a tear.
Not to do the duty to his family has always been the biggest regret of Zhang Han's heart, before his family left him, he was young and mad and did not know anything, he caused a lot of problems to his father, and he also said a lot of words that made his mother sad, all of this can not be saved.
Even though at first, Zhang Han was rebellious and rebellious, his love for his parents was no less than anyone else.
A tree wants to be quiet and the wind not still, children want to be nurtured and not cared for.
- He is a genius.
A somber voice interrupted Zhang Han's reflection, and he looked up, only to see the peak staring coldly at himself.
You threw me out of Beijing five years ago!
Five years later, today, my Los Angeles rider, Yang Peik, is back strong, and you, Zhang Han, are no better than a live pig!
He was surprised and said, "But then I won't be as strong as you".
- He is a genius.
He waved the Ferrari's keys and said, "Hey, if you win, this car is yours. I was happy when I won, but not happy".
Zhang Han laughed with a big smile.
What?
Zhang Jing laughed, held up his hands and said, "Lift up your curtains!
The crowd behind us raised television screens, and at the same time a remote-control plane was raised around Wolfgang. The screen was opened, and the footage from a remote control aircraft was sent back, and the entire course of the Wolfgang was captured.
Get ready to start!
The fat guy with the glasses at the back of the Ford Mustang nodded darkly and sat in a Ferrari.
This week the blog posts in this thread are: "Beat the Bad Guys".
How can a cute little duck just call someone a duck?
Zhang Han shook his head with a laugh.
Hang, you can win!
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han, making a gesture of encouragement.
Thanks for your words, your car will bring me good luck.
Zhang Han glanced at him and sat on his side in the wagon.
Ready to roll!
The rage of the engines of both cars sounded at the same time.
The Ferrari, which is mounted in the corner of the mouth, has a smile.
The fat guy on the back is smiling.
The look of the lovely princess at his feet filled with fear and anxiety, and her eyes filled with tears and she was pitiful.
Zhang Han, in the wild chariot, with a cold grin.
Are you plotting to harm me?
Oh woe is me, I am not the man I was then. If I now do not repair anything, why can I blame myself?
Chapter One
Iron Lake
The 23rd special waste disposal site of the federation.
It is also known as the Tomb of the Unknowns.
With the continuing development of the religious civilization, the ancient treasure that only the monk can drive entered into thousands of homes and became an indispensable tool for ordinary people to travel, study, and work.
While bringing the convenience of life, it also generates a lot of waste of metals and scrap metal.
Most of these trash-treasures have a lot of energy left over, they are prone to radiation pollution, the construction of the treasure is extremely unstable, with the risk of explosion even, and if left to their own devices, can cause great damage to the environment.
Thus, around every big city in the country, special waste dumps have been set up to deal with the issue of waste.
The 23rd Special Waste Landfill, located in the southern suburbs of the Federal Reorganization Capital city of Palu-Go.
Below a dark sky, a foul morass, foul smelling in purple, a mountain of metal fragments like the backs of hundreds of dinosaurs from the swamp, the mountains lined with broken swords with the spotted crystal stones seated next to the swords, the tears in the caverns have already extinguished the fire of the spirit, only the insects remaining on the spirit feed from the inside explore the head, carefully measured the four-volume tomb of the crisis of the Zhou family.
It is a new beginning.
The countless metallic structures that flowered like goddesses flew around, causing a series of collapse of the surrounding garbage mountains, lifting dust all over the sky, like a devil dancing, and obscuring the entire sky.
This place that seems to be a no-life zone, only the insignificant ants and ticks make it a paradise.
Mr. Liu, curling behind a pile of garbage, licks dried-up lips, and his powdery-yellow windbreaker is filled with dust, blending him in with his surroundings.
As he took one glance at the cloud of explosions that rose not far, the young man's clear eyes showed no emotion, and he was displeased.
When the dust and metal debris splashed down on the garbage pile where he was hiding, he withdrew a little further into the rubbish pile, wearing a pair of wind-glass glasses that were big enough to cover half his face.
You're here!
At 3:52:38 p.m., the usual rubbish dump time of the day, Li Yao was the only one having a feast!
The Geng watch on his left wrist, a special hunting type introduced three years ago by his mentor, the Zen Master, Feng Lei Zhongyuan, was found in a pile of trash and repaired by him in two months.
Besides timing, it has a very powerful function that is able to record vibrations of a particular frequency and alert the owner when a specific vibration is heard in the vicinity.
The feature was originally intended to alert the hunter to the presence of a powerful demon in their vicinity.
Lee's conversion was to turn it into a reminder of the imminent arrival of the garbage ship
After a moment, accompanied by a minor noise, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
The smoke from the explosion, which clouds the night sky, is still there, along with dozens of tiny black dots that are not clearly identifiable.
Li Yao pointed at the tip of his nose, and his fingers touched the side of the windshield with his hand.
Under the red light scans, a round image is sketched of a garbage truck hidden in the dust behind the smoke.
The Pringles' hunting function also locks in the specific vibration frequency of one of the trash trucks.
Garbage ship number 1327 is you!
Li Yao lived in Fapo Tomb for 10 years, from birth to ten years old, and has had control of every inch of land and every trash boat in the sky: the Trash Boot 1327 was dedicated to the collection of the trash that was dumped in the East of Fogo city.
Upper East Side is the most luxurious area of the city, housing a number of monks whose abandoned treasures are also among the most valuable.
There are lots of fabrics that are good and even intact, but are abandoned by the monks and wealthy people simply because they are a little old fashioned or because there was an introduction of a new generation of products.
To Lee Yao, what a garbage ship, a treasure ship full of gold mines!
Whoa!
Li Yao is running with two powerful feet, firing like a bullet, hurrying through mountains of garbage, and hurrying towards the smoke and dust, towards the dumpster #1327!
The surrounding is a shaky pile of debris, at the foot is a poisoned swamp with bubbles, but Li Yao is like the most resourceful monkey in the mountains, occasionally he stands out somewhere on the trash pile, every step can pop up a few tens of meters away, moving the water, and enjoying the fun.
Lee Yao, you bastard, eating with your father again!
By now a dozen characters had emerged from behind a pile of rubbish, dressed much like Mr. Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood red glasses and ghost watch.
And they were all with hammers and sticks, and came to Jesus.
These people, like Li Yao, are the scum that feed on the 23rd special waste disposal site at Daxing.
Where there is profit, there is struggle, the discarded treasure of a ship, may be only garbage to the high-level monks, but for the poor people of the bottom, it is the hope of survival, Li Yao is the best garbage bug mixed in the tomb of Fabo, and naturally the most garbage bug is a nail in the eye and a thorn in the flesh.
Lee Yao was not bothered, he smiled a smile, his waist suddenly pulled, his body became strangely twisted, but he turned ninety degrees without any sign, a fat boy with a frown flashed before him, and also stepped a foot on his fat face, and grabbed this foot, the whole man fled thirty or forty meters.
Fat Dragon, come on out to eat, who is faster, you should lose weight!
The fat teenager had a huge red mark on his face, his nose was sinking deeply into the fat, he was screaming and angry, and the commander was chasing him and the group quickly moved into the smoky area.
We have only just had an explosion, the situation is very unstable, dozens of garbage piles can collapse at any time, even the most vicious and vicious soap dragons cannot get in, we can't even slow down to watch Li Yao's energy surge.
The soap dragon is not able to take a bite.
As it turned out, another explosion occurred inside a garbage heap not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal structures and debris came crashing down like a tsunami.
What a spirit!
But a voice came from the midst of the smoke, saying, "Come up!
A blazing spark of black lava, darker than the night sky, splattered and slid into an orbit in a stream of metal mountains, and then sprang to the sky, but a handful of stained spots, a gap in the edge of the blade, a blackened sword, a large sword with a huge guard with black wings, and Li Yao like a drowning man dying to catch the grass, very clumsily crawled on the sword, a black lava circled round and rushed toward the sky!
In the sky, dozens of trash ships had already revealed huge figures, each hundreds of meters long, round-shaped, rolling like the legendary tortoise that holds up the earth, covered with thick rags inscribed with tens of thousands of signs, flashing lights, and colored patches to help the thousands of tons of people resist the invasion of gravity.
Whoo!
The opening in the belly of a great crow, the metal pieces and fragments of the treasure are released and fall to the ground.
And all the powers of the heavens and the earth trembled with a great craze, and were afraid.
Even garbage ships, weighing hundreds of thousands of tons, were being tossed, swayed, and bounced by the tides, and had to disperse, to minimize interference.
But even the savon and the people of that time did not dare go near it for fear of being hit by the waves.
Li Yao is still riding his black sword in the spiritual wave of the tide, and although he is as pale in form as the pole, he is as flexible as a muddy sword.
He does not dare to face the shockwave, but thanks to the experience of more than 10 years of survival, he tries to find a relatively peaceful safe area between the tides of spiritual force, only to get as close to the landing of trash treasures as possible.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage boat made a tremendous noise, shifted its course, sailed back, and the smoke began to disappear.
He has a hard time getting into the center of the dump, when Li Yao is found sitting comfortably on a new garbage pile, and looking at him with a smile.
Whoa!
The face of the soap dragon is flesh-bound, but the heart is tangled.
The rubbish heap chosen is not the largest, nor does it appear to be the most resource-rich.
The area is also surrounded by dozens of rubbish hills, housing a treasure trove of valuable garbage in the city.
If you continue to fool around here with Li Yao, you will probably get some money from other garbage collectors.
All around, other garbage canes have appeared, and the mountains of garbage have been cheered by people saying that someone has found something of value.
Saebung heard that Li Yao, the poor bastard, was a student of the second high school affiliated with the famous Deng-Chao sect in Fugu City.
The Red Guards were a well-known sect in the south of the Confederacy.
Although Li Yao did not have to learn anything about the real story, he could not fight with his hands and his feet, or he would not have walked on a horse in the tomb of Fabo for more than a dozen years, still alive and jumping, and even spitting out a cool nickname!
But he's gone, where did his face go?
His nose is still embedded in flesh, His heart is twisted, a storm has passed, and the soap-thrower is reaching for the cold, but it is a discarded crystal brain the size of a fist.
Li Yao smiled and said: "Shoeburning, we are all out to live, not that last time you stole a bright blue-green crystal brain, not kill your father, so that does not die? Well, I have just found a shaoburning 17 shaoburning type crystal brain, is the most advanced model, it can process more than five thousand thoughts per second, although it is burned, I estimate I can also sell three or four thousand pieces, I pay tribute to your fat dragon big brother, how about we have to make the difference from now on? "
Oh you...Hungry-Dun didn't expect Li Yao to come out like that and he got up, some of them couldn't believe that their face was so full of grease
Hey, look over there, the coyotes are coming soon, but unlike me, a loner who will definitely eat dozens of garbage mountains and clean them off, not even a screw will be left for you!
Oh good boy, you have a suit! Let's go and clean up!
A group of garbage worms disperse and swarm in all directions around garbage mountains.
Mr. Lee was breathing, and his ass sat in the trash heap, a big lump of sweat rolling down his forehead, and a smile in his face was crying.
Fuck fat man, we're not easy to find, and our silicone-grade crystal brain, cheap for you!
Wait a minute, is my Li Yao Chen stuff really that good?
So I thought I would have my money, so one day you'd eat my money and spit it out, then return it to me with interest, and you'd find out why people call me a money-lender".
It can't, you have to speed up, the wolf-wolf help the wolf-wolf with the junk, but it is more absurd than the fat dragon!
Hey, how many times have I told you, I am to save lives, not to kill myself!
Don't lie to me, you can't save a dog, can you? Besides, there's no one in the river!
Wang Yao didn't say anything, today he came down from the mountain and saw someone falling into the river in the village and hurriedly jumped down to save someone, and just remembered after jumping down that he would not have water at all, and even more ironically, the person falling in was not a person, but an inflated doll, very realistic.
Who in the village used that kind of thing?!
That was his last thought before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again, lying on his couch, his parents were by his side, grumpy.
And less than a day later, the entire village knew that the stupid college student who had taken out a mountain lease, and had grown herbs, had given up and jumped into the river and killed himself.
80% of that kid is out of school, and where are the famous college students now, to go back to their farm?
This is it!
The medicine, you can't grow it!
The father, who had been sitting nearby smoking a pack of cigarettes, shouted these words, the villagers are nice people, this is what the wind is saying, the old king heard the panic in his heart, and again sowed, lost some money, and did not even get his son lost.
"No, this time I have listened to you, stop growing herbs, and go to the city tomorrow and let your sister help you find a decent job, your uncle Zhan's children graduated from an obscure school, found a job in the city, and now they have to buy a house!"
After hearing that, Wang Yao no longer raised his head to his parents, he merely nodded.
He was a student who graduated from a renowned university, after graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm, started his own business, and hired a wild mountain in the village, to grow herbs and make his family rich.
In the first year, the herbs he planted got infected, and the roots didn't come back, in the second year, the herbs bloomed, and the long leaves did not grow, and this is the third year, the eye looks a little better, but then this row broke up.
But after regaining his health, he climbed the South Mountain, which was a barren mountain, probably due to the soil, did not yield much crops, but had dozens of large chestnut and palm trees, a large slope on the mountain, where he worked hard to dig out several tons of medicinal field, for this purpose he also spent money to hire people to build a small house on the mountain, light the lightning, care for the medicine field, the wind and rain, spring, summer and winter, he poured three years of heart, blood to give up, he really could not help it.
Looking at the beautiful herbs, he reached out and touched it.
To try again for another year?
If the herb is detected by the frog, and the trigger condition is met, does it activate the unit?
A cold, mechanical sound suddenly came.
What sound, who?
Around the corner, there are mountains, water and forests, there is no one.
Wow, this is a hallucination.
Did you activate the system?
The sound of the machine echoes once again, as if it were on the dial.
What a ghost!
Wang Yao was a living soul.
The pharmacist system?
When he had finished speaking, a cloud appeared in front of him like a man lying in a deep sleep.
It must be a hallucination.
And he removed the head of the eagle, and the veil of the hawk was not found.
And behold, a wild dog came down from the mountain, and came to him, and spit on his tongue, and wagged his tail, and was exceedingly glad.
Hey, where did you go?
This is the country dog that King Yao raised, who accompanied him on this mountain for three years. One by one, the dogs went into the hut on the mountain. King Yao lay down on the bed for a while and felt faint.
What the hell was that?
He read the name of the general again, and the light appeared again, as if in a projection.
She's here again!
After a few experiments, Wang Yao determined that the thing was not an illusion, but something real that could not be explained by science. It had attributes, skills, and packages just as a network game would have.
In fact, you can't even count birds, you can only count an egg!
A physical ability of 1.0, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, willpower 1.1 ((1 is the average for a normal adult male).
Is it true? He is completely covered.
How well, now he is planting herbs, what is left is this! The king of the gods who has returned gets up suddenly excited and terrifies all the other flies beside him.
And there is a skill panel?
Why can't my mother open it?" asked his subconscious.
All herbs are bad, and if you want to do something else, just go!
One of the guards of the police, who appears to have heard his question, is seen reading on the board:
I'm sorry, what is going on here? Who designed it, come out, I promise I won't kill you!
Wang Ming looked through the wrapped containers and spotted a sign that looked like a water jug.
The ancient spring, a water fountain, one barrel a day.
What's the use of reaching out?
When Wang Yao remembered, he had in his hands a wooden water jug, an old perfume, held in his hand, also a small amount of water jug. He had one small jug, with a water jug inside that made noise.
There is water there, a spring of water!
He took a bucket in the room and poured water out of the bathroom, a little bit, but the water kept coming, and it wouldn't stop until the whole bucket was full.
This is amazing?
The King was stunned and looking at the water in the bucket, it was so clean and pure. He reached out a hand and took a sip and put it in his mouth, and it was so sweet.
Have a drink!
And he took the cup that was on the table, and rose up and drank, and after drinking three great glasses, he stopped, and drank it, and was very much refreshed, and the weariness left him.
Well, the three flowers at one side are circling around the bucket.
Come and have a drink too.
The king also put a bowl of water in his drinking-pot for her, but the dog soon drank it up, and then cried out again, wagging its tail, evidently not enough.
Go, have a drink!
This guy, a dog, drank half a bucket of water, which, if they didn't panic, they would have drunk all of it!
Wang Yao had never drank such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1: I want to lose weight!
In the hot summer day in the eastern part of the federation, the clouds of the pond cloud forests, clouds spread, like a thin layer of mist, a safflower tree, a tree, vertically interspersed, with thickly vegetated trees, while a few birds rise, a few soaring birds in the sky.
There, in the sky, the sun that seemed to have an eternity is no longer remembered, but years ago, it was cut straight through by a huge and indescribable ancient bronze sword, half pointed and small!
And as this sword, of ages gone, comes from the starry sky, pouring forth endless dew, and a strong pressure, forming a ray, covering a sword, as if it could crush the earth and make the creatures bow.
From a distance, this rainforest looks like a picture book, only to be broken by the rustling of it in the distance. A red balloon is slowly flying above the rainforest.
The hot air balloon is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and you can see many young men and women, three to five, gathered on decks, cheering and laughter.
They were students from the city of Chang'an, one of the four major seminaries of the Union, who were travelling on an oak boat, and travelled many kilometers to study at the school.
Perhaps it's the anticipation for studying, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, and there is some strong attraction between men and women, which makes the 10,000 miles a bit of a fun trip 🤭
Also, due to the distance of travel, the spacecraft is equipped with a canteen, a prayer room, and a medical area.
There's a crowd of students in the dining hall of the aircraft, and one of them, sitting at the table, is a little fat man with his belly out.
The little fat man, about seventeen or eight, dressed in a broad blue robe, his small round face hardly revealing, while tapping his belly, making a shrieking sound, while looking with unfathomable remorse at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
I'll have to eat it and gain another 3 pounds, but I can't stop myself, I want to be the President of the Federation, I can't die before my senior year ᅲ
The little fat boy looked sad and confessed after a long time and punched a brick. This little fat man was Wang Bao, and this time he was admitted to the convent. His lifelong dream was to become a judge, to become a federal president, his lifelong pursuit, the reason for such a great ideal, is inseparable from his childhood experiences.
In his memory, his father used to pat him on the head with his big heart and "buzz" when he was a child.
If you want to be rich or rich as a ruler, remember that although money can solve everything, you will be bullied, do not want to be abused, only be a ruler and be above everyone.
In the beginning, Wang Bao did not understand, until he was in primary school because he did not deliver his homework on time, he was chided by the headmaster, and after he sent two pieces of sugar, he was again registered by the class captain and reported to the teacher, all this left an indelible mark on his young heart.
From that time on he wanted to be on the move again, not to rob anyone, but to be robbed himself.
But as he grew up, he found that there was more than enough to bully the headmaster, so he felt that no one dared to bully themselves to be the biggest official, i.e. the President of the Federation.
However, his health is not good, his bloodline is unusual, and he still remembers the night a year ago when his father, parched like wood, showed him the family tree in the family hall.
It was the first time that Wang Bao saw the genealogy, he clearly saw, that the ancestors of the generation were, but those who weighed over two hundred kilos, died prematurely, no less than 35 years old.
That night, Wang Bao had a dream... he joined the fat men before he became president of the Federal Republic.
After a year, for him, the weight loss issue had reached a certain level, but even after the Federation entered the Yuan age, as the spirit of the spirit, with the revival of ancient martial arts, the weight loss methods are also five-and-eight doors, but Wang Baool tried almost all, and the weight is still stable.
The memory was there, and Wang Baol-hui took a bite and decided to lose weight again tomorrow.
Having made this decision, King Bolton felt much less pressure; while grinding his teeth and singing a little song, he looked at the distant blue sky outside the window, and his mind became active.
My mom never saw that the present he gave to Dr. Lu, he liked it, or not, but it was an antique from my house, and the old man should like it.
The prince consoled himself, and, as long as he was with Dr. Liu, he thought of a small hill in the courtyard.
My teacher has a few powers, but she'll have to give gifts in the future, but this doctor is too old, he must have a lot of connections. I'll do this step to get it right.
Thinking about this, Wang Bao felt as if he was one step closer to being the President of the Federation.
He is very confident that he will be able to become President of the Federal Republic of Germany, and this confidence is due mostly to the fact that he has researched all the biographies of all the top officials from small to large, even summarized some of his assassination tricks.
She looked out at the blue sky outside the window and thought it was beautiful.
Very soon he opened his eyes and noticed a dark cloud in the far sky, as if to cover the sky, with a lightning inside, and a flash of electric lighting, slowly approaching, this scene also attracted the attention of many students, giving a startled cry.
He was also surprised when the Federation entered the age of the spirit, because the spirit emerged, resulting in a lot of amazing weather in heaven and earth, the former flying objects were difficult to secure, this was the birth of the hot air balloon craft powered by the spirit stone.
As the thunder suddenly came on, the thunder was loud, and it was amazing to see that the black cloud of thunder was growing fast in the distance, and the lightning had spread, like a large black net, the sky was spinning, the sight was startling, the man's heart pulsated.
But as the people were still in an agitated mood the door of the dining room was pushed open, as if by a breath of wind, and an old man dressed in a white tunic entered; he had a wrinkled face, but with a fair-faced face, and his face was straight, especially the eyes shining, with a great sense of well-being, and the sound of his authority was heard throughout the whole restaurant as soon as he arrived.
Everyone, report to the monastery right away and put on your robes, and after half a dozen incense beads, we will enter the thunderbolt!
When he heard this, the disciples were amazed and terrified.
As Wang Bao's eyes lit up, the old man in front of him, who was the Liu Doctor who had given him a gift before, was looking at his adversary's dragonlike temperament, Wang Bao felt more and more that his previous investment was right, implying that this old guy must be very popular, and he was a chess master.
As he was in a merry mood, the old doctor glanced at the king, shouted, then took half a black mask from his arm and threw it over the king.
Little girls, do not put your mind in some messy places, you have not entered the court yet, you learned to give gifts, your husband is also a knowledgeable person, your mask, or keep it for yourself. Ah, the old doctor is stunned, an appearance of purity, as if the iron did not become steel.
Wang Baool took the mask and felt sad when he saw that the old doctor was angry, in a hurry, just wanted to explain, but suddenly he thought about the murder mystery he had summed up in his autobiography about the high officials, one of which was admitting to his mistakes in front of the boss, first time with a heavy face, and often making it big and small.
Then take a deep breath, and hurry to show some semblance of remorse, and admit your error.
My teacher said yes, I was wrong!
Some of the elders were amazed at the words that were spoken, and some of them were speechless because of the great pain of their hearts.
Wang Bao-Ling saw the look on the teacher's face and was relieved to find something nice, implying that the official's autobiography was indeed useful.
The old doctor cried out and looked up at all the students in the cafeteria and pointed with his right hand to the crowd.
And all of you, all you pupils of my future path, see what your days are like, you will always remember that I am the warrior, first stand, then speak, then act.
The old doctor was filled with indignation, and his words were repeated again, so that all who were listening, did not lower their heads, and they were somewhat ashamed, while Wang Bao's eyes lit up brightly, and he felt that it was time to perform.
So he quickly took a booklet from his arms, wrote down in it, looked up at the old doctor now and then, made a look of listening, nodded seriously from time to time, as if trying to remember every word the other person said, which was also the trick he summed up in the autobiography of the high-ranking official.
The other students saw the scene as if the gods were looking at the king's treasury in general.
The elder doctor stopped a moment after seeing it, a feeling of strangeness unprecedented, did not come to mind, he did indeed meet so many students, it was the first time he had met such a strange person, he looked a few times, but then gradually smiled.
Hey young man, my husband's horse is not that good, you should be grateful for the thunderstorm, otherwise, my husband can breath for three days and three nights, and I wonder if you can write it all on a booklet.
The old doctor spoke, the mood changed, the breath of the strong man spread from him, like a pressure, covered the whole dining hall, and the students were astonished, just thinking that the fight was, or the old doctor was a foot tall │
Wang Bo-le closed his eyes, touched the recording device in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and watched the approaching thunderstorm, or abandoned the idea of taking out, he felt embarrassed and not embarrassed in front of his boss.
Seeing the crowd, the doctor was happy inside and spoke a few words of generosity and enthusiasm.
O Lord, remember that you must put the thought in the discipline, and in the future to be a man, not greedy, not unjust, not to think of any other woman, know the color of the letter on the head of a sword, these days, my lords, I really did not like the word.
Just as I spoke here, all of a sudden, a dripping sound came from the old doctor's voice box.
Dr. Lee, where are you, people don't wear this magnetic costume, you come help me
As soon as the doctor heard it, his body jerked at his own motion. He coughed a little, stared at the crowd in earnest. This turned his head in a frantic turn and he went away, and at the same time rushed to the opening of the excitement of his inspired mother. Oh, come, baby don't rush, I have come to help you.
This reversal was so swift, so great, that all the people shed a tear, and even the king's chamberlain gasped half a moment, and gasped half a minute, and with the unrestrained roar of the people, the king's chamberlain gnashed his teeth, and cursed a few words.
Oh, old man, the ones before you are nonsense! There are so many female classmates, and we are not enough, he is so old, he also comes to us to steal resources, is he not an official by reason of his size? Oh.
The more Wang Baolei was angry, the more he talked about his dream of becoming an official with his fellow students.
When the alarm sounded, the crowd had just stopped arguing, and one of them, furiously angry, went to the monastery.
The spiritual room, located in the central area of the craft, is, as the name suggests, the place where the students practiced meditation and where the craft was safeguarded most closely as it passed through the special area.
At this moment, as the crowd gathered inside the monastery, all of them seated in rows under the direction of the Monastery's ship teachers, dressed in their ships' special magnetic robe issued by the monastery.
Just dressed up in his magnetic suit, Wang Bao was immersed in his hatred of Dr. Luo, willingly lifted his head to look around, Ben was in a gloomy mood, because a glance from a distance, suddenly more nasty, unconscious brows raised, showed a look of disgust.
He had seen a woman sitting on two legs, very moving but with a frown and a look of disgust, and it was clear in their eyes that they both knew each other and hated each other extremely.
What a surprise.
The two of them were in a hurry to hide their eyes, as if looking at each other as if looking into each other's eyes.
Everywhere you can find this flat-topped doomin, it's annoying to die! There's something remarkable about you, but a bad class chief, waiting for the court, with the help of my official killer, the boss can also mix half of his job!
Soon after everyone had dressed, the teachers in the shrine changed their minds after inspecting the boat one by one, and even sternly warned the crowds that after the aircraft entered the thunderstorm zone, there was a risk of a crisis of life and death.
And when they saw all the people transformed, the sailors with the boat withdrew, and the doors of the temple were shut shut, and the light was dimmed.
In this room, while there was still quiet conversation, with the passage of time tension became more intense, and then the room went into complete silence.
In the silence as if one could hear his own heartbeat, even though he was still in the state of calm, he did not stop being nervous until after half an hour, the whole craft shook violently, entering the thunder magnetic zone!
From the outside, the entire thundercloud is like a big mouth, and will be compared to a tiny hot air balloon that swallows.
Such a weather is, as if it contained the power of destruction, it can sweep everything, perhaps only at dawn, that round of frightful sword-fighting, can be ignored by all, as if looking down at men for thirty-seven years is not enough, or even longer.
and in the thirty-seventh year of the reign of Jehu.
In 329 A.D. geotechnology was developing rapidly, without borders, to realize the unity of the Earth, into the era of the Federation, and it was at this time that a great sword flew from the stars, pierced the sun and the world shook.
As for the great sword, perhaps because its handle was broken off, the great quaking broke into pieces, and scattered it throughout the sky, some of which fell to the various parts of the earth.
With the arrival of the big bronze sword, with the fall of the shrapnel, the earth was suddenly endowed with a new energy, that seemed to be spreading in space and without end, which was named... spirit!
The air of the inspiration is rich or thin, and the fragments of the fallen, obtained by the Federation and various forces, found on it, contain a variety of techniques related to cultivation and the instruments of purification, the sacred alchemical, and alchemical stone. The script is full of antiquity, causing people to contact the ancient scriptures and become a trend.
And the emergence of the spirit spirit, quickly eliminated the original energy, changed people's lives, not only formed the spirit network, but also changed the process of Earth's civilization, so that the whole Earth, opened the practice of civilization.
From that time, Kuwu was born, the world changed, and the era of the monks of the whole people began.
The period is known as the Heian Period.
At this moment, in the dark magnetic cloud, the red hot air balloon, a slow moving carrier with countless lightening bolts around it, is constantly bombarded and protected by a soft diffusion screen that makes the plane very secure.
As for the reclining room in the central area of the boat, all the disciples, including Wang Bao-li, were now unconsciously asleep, as if a strange power had guided them into the dream world.
In the ship's main cabin alone, there were seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some laughing, having a relaxed conversation with each other, completely different from those who had previously scared the students.
The leader was an old man, with a wrinkled face, with a cigarette-gun, and a cigarette in his mouth, which if Wang Baoul was here, he would recognise at a glance - he was the shameless Dr. Lu Lu.
With the introduction of a middle aged teacher, the old doctor, who was smoking a cigarette, chuckled.
