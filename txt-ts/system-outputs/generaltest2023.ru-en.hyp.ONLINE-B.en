The July issue is traditionally rented out during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: reading the stripes when the soul is torn to Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell about the MIFF next time (for now, I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely insulting principle, has finally become stronger in the minds of the organizers, which no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try to somehow not miss the story about "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, rebooted "Batman ..."), most - without fools - the expected film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here we definitely don’t need to specifically advertise anything, and it’s a no brainer that the author of Suspicion and Rope is our Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibiuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Olly Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina Evelyn Salt, a Londoner from Tseraushnitsa, despite a brilliant track record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided what no matter what, catch it.
Driven into a corner, she will be repainted in the black we are used to and she herself will go to seek the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal woman-boy promises to further strengthen the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "The Matrix" and, like children, scatter strong men in the same strict suits.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was his most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless incarnation of Evil.
And at the same time, all together it turned out not to be a boring American-style block buster about saving humanity, but to be the cutest living carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between "Element ..." and "Adele ..." I don’t want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this screenwriting and production fuss and rare, labored directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele ..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe opposite and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises await you behind every turn or cue.
And all of them are pleasant.
Is it a girl or a vision
ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES
The most daring adventure movie of the decade hints that Adele's Extraordinary Adventures will start as Amelie, rush towards Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about the journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adele.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the audience with an outstretched hand, begging for special effects, scenery or stunts, but carries him along like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a big journey to the center of the earth or to the ends of the world: “Forward, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not indulging in cynicism and not embarrassed by risk
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgouzne, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
Plot: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster, which was awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a business not so much with the beast itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
OUT JULY 22
"Adele ..." is the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with the gangster action movies of Quentin Tarantino, with the mentioned "Indiana Jones" (they bowed to him and ridiculed), finally, with the same "The Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot balancing act (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words must be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten character of an adventurer who wins not so much with the exploitation of sexuality, but with pure courage and courage.
In the cinema, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho or hairy romantic on duty.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
In the presence of only a timid and comical admirer, who only spins underfoot (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative dashing, recalling that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and high-browed regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
Hermetic horror with pretensions to psychologism and political context In 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was scolded by critics, but the audience liked it and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got into a factory that forges new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to remake all the horror classics in the form of remakes and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Criticism grimaced again, but the audience liked it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, using his example, one can observe how an entire genre is rushing about in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing a jaded audience: the naturalistic bloodshed of splatters merges with the catch-up slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut picture of Vincenzo Natali "Cube". The film was made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to take a different path: he preferred a smarter option to a stupid massacre or a monotonous running from a maniac - almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are being tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has become adept at wild experiments.
Plot: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given to each pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, behind which government agents are closely watching behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for a frank arthouse
He can conduct small talk, and go in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he is unable to miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is prudent and adamant in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courteous lifestyle and frankly peeps at how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the difference in generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl’s unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
The father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre was convincingly portrayed by Depardieu
The fragmentary plot winds around the love affairs of the heroes, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, following a witty director's find, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, an athlete-drunk performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are only dotted.
I especially feel sorry for the line about the business of buying up football players, which remained behind the scenes.
Plot: More than anything, a sales agent for football stars is worried about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a rod."
Imagine the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got "nine": "Do not look for a problem where it does not exist." You can't really say.
Their resemblance is simply amazing.
In both tapes there are detachments of harsh guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who framed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The characters jump around almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and here and there something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind descends on the scenery from bucks.
Even the villains dressed up in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by the Patricks - Jason Patric here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvan White used to shoot about dance battles - "The Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently called on to play a character from other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvan White was inspired by a comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without agreeing, brought different material to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you really have to choose between these two tapes, then the "Losers" look a little prettier and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who's very good at bazooka.
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: a helicopter with children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive - and intend to take revenge at all costs on the villain with a languid voice, who set it all up.
All this is nice, but, frankly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting is only worth it if you have absolutely no more interesting options.
Made from recycled, conditionally edible action movie
A simple story about an escaped Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, cinema promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, moreover, tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were given a lecture on Bresson in the early 80s.
The film won the Jury Grand Prix at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on the play by Andrea Valean, whose work is in great demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cameraman Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is also true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not at all abusive, but recommendatory in nature: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods
its work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be seized: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the abyss separating two cultures, can easily be
converted into an exploitation a la the 70s, with a cowboy who decided to take a walk from the jail, from where he will soon be leaving, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: Having cut off his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna encourages the guy even more to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What is all this nonsense!
If you want to watch, watch.
A good debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of the Romanian arthouse
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray eminence of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look in the 3D), especially if you like it when different objects continually strive to jump off the screen into the audience), passably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single joke below the waist, because of which, on the Ice Ages, you had to shyly squeeze into an armchair and cover children's ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the sense of proportion of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn is dictated by the unwillingness to touch the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main collision of lonely fatherhood, rather harsh black humor is responsible (which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it even turns out to be too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every little thing so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
It's not that we want to see children's cartoon characters eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion.
PLOT: Big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dream of space exploration has been transformed over the years into an idea to steal the moon, has to resort to the help of children to fulfill a great plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, in terms of a lethal degree of cuteness comparable only to the cat from Shrek.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The protagonist is based on Christopher Meledandri - they are both bald, nosy and prone to black humor.
The main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances the part of Travolta
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of good-quality boobs come out.
Exactly.
By themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera confidently fixes attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news - the whole film is sustained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there are a lot of funny things going on.
“Broker”, “killer” and “stripper” dig in the sand, pour water over them (do not ask why), carry some kind of snowstorm and periodically fight quite fiercely.
The creators believe that a cursing chick with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
Bitchy Things is primarily focused on classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena the Warrior Princess" and "The Wonderful Journeys of Hercules."
A congenial film at the Moscow box office is “A Barrel for Jennifer”.
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty spins balls for a bandit, a fucked up punk fights paired with a Japanese schoolgirl, this comes with a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue unwinds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a movie fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It's understandable, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun filming this thrash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from a night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia leader into the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial amount hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to claw, fight with each other and scumbags periodically arriving from somewhere, as well as kissing and squeezing regularly.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they were at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more fun.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest painting, Doomsday, a liberated Mad Max for the have-nots, Marshall misfired.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-movie aesthetics.
There is in the picture both the hooligan courage of the Dog-Warriors, and the bestial cruelty of The Descent.
The "Marshall Plan" to cleanse the "peplum" of adhering post-gladiator film mud, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred Legionnaires (the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham, among others) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Mortality and piquant details of the administration of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the opening distribution in the German forests from Sir Ridley Scott's now reference Gladiator, but for some reason I absolutely don’t want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of present-day Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost where the centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is serving is ruthlessly defeated by the reconnaissance company of the Picts.
Miraculously surviving Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to elude a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itain (Kurylenko).
The subtle art-house artist has so far managed to win back only sharply characterizing supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after the "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum - revised and enlarged edition.
Almost like a "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
Continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her difficult relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the bodybuilder werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy sorcerer, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The lord of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the object's dream, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hope of defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will arrange a bedlam with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty plotted to take over the whole world, and now super agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the furry family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs, led by a frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously end up on another planet, where they are sport hunted by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of the iconic character of the 80s to the big screen.
Check out George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-filmmaker Anton Corbijn (Control) for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly comprehending human nature.
"A visionary artist of Corbijn's stature and the magnificent George Clooney is a film alliance made in heaven," a studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel A Very Secretive Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: an American took the place of the English narrator, and the protagonist turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to figure out his last case and finally get involved in a profitable craft, his icy heart melts under the spell of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Ryuten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well be not the one she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe to star in film adaptation of Remarque's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'
And can I click you with a photo gun !?
Johnny Depp has been seen in two places this season.
Firstly, in Venice on the set of the thriller The Tourist by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Lives of Others).
There he plays a tourist who is in love with the heroine of Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of The Rum Diary, the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson ("Withnail & Me"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can not approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects on their account: “Lucky Gilmore”, “Big Daddy”, “Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding”, “Don't Mess with Gohan!”.
In July, the fifth comedy, Odnoklassniki, is released, and the sixth, The Pretending Wife, starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in the works.
The schedule also includes the seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the audience this year for the enchanting action movie Kick-Ass, will reboot the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first of all called James McAvoy, assigning him the role of young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will be reincarnated as the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the shooting of the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to get bored.
His to-do list includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of Isan McEusen's novel "On the Shore."
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan is offered the female lead.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of down-to-earth Major George Smiley - the protagonist of the John Le Caret series of novels - in the film adaptation of the thriller Get Out Spy!
Alec Guinness played in the first adaptation of this work in 1979.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's best-selling science fiction novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been received by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
Filming of the international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is underway in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war for their money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film is slated for release in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell to Star in 'Baby Jesus' Comedy with English Pop Star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
According to the Ragatoipe film company, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
However, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl does not have any experience in the cinema, so she will have an accelerated course in acting.
This fact should not frighten a sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monster), Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted), Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (LA Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started out as fashion models or starred for fashion magazines, as a result they received a well-deserved Oscar.
The beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko, also excelled in acting.
High awards are clearly at arm's length.
In a word, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who deserved a Special Mention by the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film “Everyone will die, but I will stay” and filmed the scandalous television series “School”, received the position of creative director on the MT channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also began casting new presenters.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Freaks".
The main theme of the film remains the same - the provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hurries to Moscow to see his bride, but is delayed to train the homeless football team.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, Milla Iovovich will perform the role of the capital's bride Nadia.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear - the former fiance of Nadia Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in the filming of The Hobbit and the presence of a mass of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro resigned from the position of director.
The studios are urging producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he's willing to take that step only if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors are David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie to play Cleopatra
Crazy from the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at super speed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were flowing, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved to match - in almost every one someone fled somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Guest worker" and Dmitry Mamuliya's "Another Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "To Live"
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of the detective Klim Shipenko “Who am I?” - which, however, was remembered by the public rather by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal to be slaughtered, and Evgeny Grishkovets talked about his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in a film production on two "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcoduel because of a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also had a tangible imprint of the show - none of them were boring.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, a picturesque quarrel with critics was arranged by the chairman of the fund for supporting Russian cinema, Sergei Tolstikov: “Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?” he demanded menacingly from the audience.
"I write them," the president of ERVEZS answered in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Aleksey Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films from large festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, say, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happiness participated in the competition, competing with Mikhalkov and Viracetakun on the Azure beret in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of the former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like the picture of Loznitsa at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - received a daughter
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A finely choreographed, cleansing experience film directed by a math-trained misanthrope that calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult film "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a director's star has been born.
Impeccably dressed and trimmed, the programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive organs falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants,” producer Sabina Yeremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought differently: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull out the “internal debutant” from the luminary of Russian art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema the bison are moving after the youth.
And not at all vice versa.
A documentary filmed in such a way that it blows your head cleaner than from a similar feature film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron frying pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his sharp-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real oil dock canvas.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, tries on the black and white style of the French new wave in the world of sleeping areas.
Let Godard's montage moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other dreaming of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
“Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 types, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influence, take to the skies on clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granular carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological squibs with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” the clouds coming to the city with these reagents. Particles of matter condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and in the exact place where the impact on the cloud occurred.
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the sci-fi film, in which the main role was played by Michael York.
Recently, Carl Rinsch (who already has a remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon on his schedule) was appointed director, famous for his commercials.
Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeague (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) have previously been associated with the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from a death sentence, as the society of the future will execute all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a 1980s rotoscopic fantasy cartoon and plans to make it into a big movie.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (film The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves the princess Tigra and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to carefully consider the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation soon as 1 himself plans to remake Dario Argento's giallo classic.
None other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions and horror remakes, will return the heroes to the wide screens.
The remake will be directed by Daming Chen and will adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed Two Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script for it.

“I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of things in China,” Chen says.
“Chinese women these days run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
It is an accident?
Pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I present here (at the Kinotavr and the Sochi film market - EMRBE) two films.
And in both I play a dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and it probably seems to many that I am like that in real life.
Dream girl.
Your partner in the film Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the court?
It is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought: "Yes ... not just I have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened just a few minutes after we met.
We are great, I’m not afraid of this word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave this advice and this help to me.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this, because I was very afraid of losing this contact, losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor as a child, I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city where you want to return.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everywhere always has time.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which, frankly, many did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I am a very, by nature, trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, entrust myself to his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will sculpt.
I understand perfectly well that from the side it’s more visible, and I, again, ask for hints and talk with the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and very clearly and accurately explains what he needs.
And then after many hours of long rehearsals we come to the organics you are talking about.
And how did you work with the film director Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, the operator, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and this was exactly the situation here.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something didn’t work out, it was a disaster, and something urgently needs to be done in order to make it happen.
It is very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to the point of morbid fanaticism in what they do, it cannot fail, because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios are you giving up?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you will work?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
I don’t want to work for the sake of just appearing on the screen once again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not the kind of person who paints charts.
The script came, it interested me, this premiere happened today.

GLASNOST BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on almost continuously in Moscow: American cinema - Amfest, 2toggo \, 2-t-1 will begin in a few days, followed by a British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of the acquaintances are constantly discussing that it is necessary to boycott someone, and support someone, for some - well, excuse me - very vague reasons.
However, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed by a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to do is grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will show them to you.
In the meantime, we have no pixels outside the room: “Tron: Legacy” (a continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), “Let me in. The Saga (an American remake of a great Swedish film), Out of Control (another take on trains by Tony Scott), and a wildly detailed account of how Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer, and the governor were made.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
The film tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Starring Jesse Eisenberg is as great as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable array of motivations and loyalties.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly because of anger at the world around him, partly because of sports interest, and partly simply because IT IS "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network are evident from the first frame, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erika (Mara) for five minutes: the sonorous, tough dialogue of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is gaining momentum here and do not soften until the very end.
The same with Fincher's directing: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins played by dissimilar actors.
The face of one of them was superimposed by computer graphics on the other.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having been turned down on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a groundbreaking social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few companion friends begin to falter and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sometimes sunny, yet cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Outside of the flow of non-stop discussions, there isn't much going on in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to pull even an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What drew Sorkin, 49, and Fincher, 48, to this not-too-detailed story?
After viewing, there is a strong feeling that The Social Network is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just a mere twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing pretty much the same thing, only on a larger scale, with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, politics is no longer carried out at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, wants to be the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, stomp their feet: who said that the rich, handsome, and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line amuses Fincher especially.)
If desired, The Social Network could well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what are the social consequences of his invention?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close a book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But here it won't even be needed: in their version of the story, it doesn't matter at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" - asks in the song Tre VeaNez "WaBu Woz'te A Vsp Map", anticipating the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
Tasteful character drama about high-profile internet-era litigation
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of humble origin had not really begun to appear yet.
They got by with the name "such and such, such and such a son."
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames after the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of remarriages of the father, a matronym was used - a nickname named after the mother.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna."
The serfs of the small landlords did for a really long time without surnames - why is it when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the 18th century. all had surnames.
In the 19th century even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the ground, but let him go for quitrent - let him earn from his craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname was to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of the serfs were released for quitrent.
So, they already had surnames.
Moscow criminologists arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic experts from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help investigate the case of a gas explosion in a house on Lineinaya, 39, NGS reports.
According to investigators, the defendants, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious Mezhregiongaz organization, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, overpriced their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineinaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This resulted in a significant collapse of the building, killing 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of a house explosion in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a sea surge flood
Arguments of the Week.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding due to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
Marine surge flooding was averted by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closing of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the situation with the water level.
This helps to prevent flooding, which can follow an increase in wind.
Turkey arrests 8 people over faulty work in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
More than 20,000 people died as a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of tremors that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sends congratulatory messages to Iranian Supreme Leader and President
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyyed Ali Khamenei and President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ebrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday, a World War II bomb exploded, which sappers tried to neutralize.
A powerful explosion was heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, no one from the military involved in disarming the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, all personnel are intact.
Agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no dead or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the River Yar, at the mouth of which, on the coast of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective wall of sand around it, and a cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was put up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosives experts at first, on Thursday, were going to use a robot to cut off the fuse from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of "slow burning" of explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Almost 40% of Belarusian researchers are women
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, Alesya Solovei, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, told BelTA.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in the technical sciences men predominate, women account for 26.7%.
At the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1%, which is 10.2% more than in the republic as a whole.
Among Candidates of Sciences, the share of women is 46%, among Doctors of Sciences - 20%.
More than half of the teaching staff in institutions of higher education are women (57%).
Among vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most of all women are among senior lecturers and lecturers - over 60%.
The share of women is also high among associate professors in the departments (55.2%).
According to the republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the opportunities of women in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype "science is a male field of activity".
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender ideas about the research competence of women contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, forming a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is celebrated annually as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop scientific careers and recognize the achievements of women in science.

The probability of further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently taken place.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have noticeably deteriorated - prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing down, but public spending is growing.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, the rapid unwinding of consumption in the face of elevated inflationary expectations, if the factors that constrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is a growing shortage of labor and the lagging of labor productivity growth behind wage growth.
And there are still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key rate trajectory than was expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate increase may be needed to ensure that inflation meets the target near 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (UIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the existing retail mutual funds.
This will start the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment units.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, then the management company must separate them into a separate closed mutual fund before September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is being introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay to the owners of investment shares at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, the experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, air transport passenger turnover decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines. and capitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continued subsidization of the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far), in 2023, according to our estimates, passenger traffic will increase by 6 .4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terror attack in Jerusalem kills 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
Later it turned out that this is a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the relatives of the terrorist were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is once again tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those who wish to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, more control is required.
Vienna's decision to tighten inspections follows a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures for 2016 and amounted to more than 330,000.
Cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS
The automated resupply vehicle Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station at 3.45 GMT on Saturday, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific.
The docking broadcast was hosted by NASA Mission Control in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina greeted the cargo ship from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roskosmos reported on the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the ship's passage hatch was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
The MCC also said that the ISS crew is not in danger: “The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, they are in good health."

How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and cancel the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry into the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of having arrived for the purpose of "maternity tourism."
On February 11, they were nevertheless allowed into Argentina by a court decision.
More details - in the material "Gazety.Ru".
The Migration Service of Argentina began to suspend and cancel the residence permit (permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
This was told to the C5N TV channel by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permit of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (country)", - explained she.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian is considered in court, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were “stuck” at the airport in Argentina due to denial of entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polina, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls upon entry incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more arrived on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were specifically ordered not to enter the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for preventing them from entering the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine Migration Service, by a court decision, let pregnant Russian citizens into the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short trips to 171 countries without visas, including the EU, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022, from 2,000 to 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10,000," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and over 5.8 thousand pregnant women in recent months.
On February 9, it became known how prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
She dropped 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country, rent has become more expensive by 25%, Patrol of Petersburg reports with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
Odnushka cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio - 22,000 rubles a month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Migration Service of Argentina did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
It is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly tell where she is going to rest, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".

Kirkorov won the court against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man declared the illegality of the construction of the artist, but did not appear at the meeting.
Rybak was suing music artist Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Writes about it "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.

Somnologist called the causes of sleep problems
Sophia Cherkasova, a sleep doctor, spoke about the foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the expert noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep “torn”, which means that it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, the use of caffeinated products is best stopped 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they help to lower the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Negatively affects the ability to fall asleep and alcohol.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, quantities in excess of 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy foods in bulk portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in core body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the air temperature of 18-20 degrees is optimal - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, heavy food should not be abused before going to bed, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and the accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regimen and allow the body to recover.

Deputy General Director of Russian Railways invited the governor of the Irkutsk region to develop new sales directions
The Irkutsk region needs to continue developing alternative sales directions, except for the Far East.

This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reports on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "subcontractors" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find the best price conditions for transporting their products under new schemes, - Alexey Shilo emphasized.
The governor noted the importance of stability in the shipment of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions of the Russian Federation with mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of the shipment of products for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of traffic volumes.
If additional volumes of shipment to the domestic market appear, then we are also ready to assist in this direction, - said Alexey Shilo.

Primary school students were assigned to the Khomutovsky school No. 1, the senior classes are studying in the second building of school No. 2.
According to the repair plan, the roof, utilities, windows and related elements will be replaced here, the facade will be repaired, and the interior will be finished.
An important component of the overhaul is the reconstruction of a heating point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all works is more than 80 million rubles.
The repair is in the final stage, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - an increase in power is needed, work is underway with the energy supply organization.
In addition, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, some of them were sold by developers who were illegally connected to electrical networks at home.
It was agreed that the network company would organize a face-to-face meeting next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already the basis for turning off the power supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.

Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor, - Anatoly Prokopiev emphasized.
Crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alidjan border checkpoint on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake in 1988, Turkish Anadolu agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special envoy to the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kilich said.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-affected region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The press secretary of the Armenian Foreign Ministry Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alidzhan border checkpoint was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria in the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that struck on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that it is already known from 21,848 deaths in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a vessel previously sailing under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The maritime command of Tarragona of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the port of the city to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the Directorate General of the Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged vessel Maersk Magellan because the cargo it is carrying originates from a Cameroonian-flagged vessel" Nobel, which flew under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU law, which prohibits access for any ship registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022 or changing flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the check was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships have been banned from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the port of Barcelona denied access to the Maltese-flagged vessel Black Star, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

Problems encountered by pregnant Russians with entry to Argentina explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of an influx of people wishing to have a baby in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to Professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Kheyfets, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina they do not approve of the country's transformation into a transit point, and not into a destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will decide whether to grant an Argentine passport to the parents after receiving a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left immediately, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by the "right of the soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentinean passport opens up visa-free travel to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives of the trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs are expected to open in Russia
In Russia, the interest of citizens in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Society.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva, in an interview with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NSF President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity of "working a fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand.
The industry has suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but back in 2021, it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a million population.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The license of the management company from Kirov was taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region annulled the business license for the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Care".
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license to carry out entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings, previously issued to the management company "Care", was annulled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it entered into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration revoked the license of the "manager" for the fact that the organization several times disregarded the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were in the management of "Care" are excluded from the register of licenses for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the Governor of the Kirov Region Alexander Sokolov set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspection to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The anti-monopolists allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for by the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to write off money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from others does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that settlements with customers are carried out with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted in ceramics, and therefore "in the hall".
They made me with myself.
I ask why in a glass and not in a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they don’t have 300 ml cups.
How does it fit in a person's head?
Ask with you or in the hall, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
Put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of such a volume.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelenaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I wanted. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. The cafeteria of the Green Outskirts and the Green Outskirts - sides of the same coin or organizations that are not connected with each other in any way?
If not connected, there is understanding.
If related - why did the food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality condescend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric because a similar incident, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I do not rule out what is happening not only with me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to service.
We really like the circus, we go there since our childhood.
I saw numbers with Yu Nikulin himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point and the backs of those sitting in front do not interfere with you.
The circus is very chamber, family!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can not take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
But overall a very nice place!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, he chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, they invited us to see the complex, when there weren’t even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although we looked at many apartments and not a single developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort in Russia!
The most buzz is sloping sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the trails are boring and short for me.
The longest ones are in sector e, there are even less.
But in general, a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
She did everything quickly and efficiently, the salon was clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I have already come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I have been waiting at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today in business such service is unacceptable!
The answer of the "care" service - we are trying.
At the checkout even without an apology, just - we are not to blame, this is a program.
You didn’t find any other technical means of communication with regular, previously loyal customers.
"Trying" impotent, and the business must work.
Thank you all, we're all leaving.
We will not be ordering from you again and will not recommend.
Spoiled mood, expectation of guests, apology of the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through an organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 nights for 3 people.
The houses are clean, comfortable, warm (even very warm), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge available.
Of the shortcomings, one can single out perhaps too little space, in the bathroom there is a terribly small shower.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, so I had to take a dryer from the owners and push it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so in general a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
The prices are acceptable.
There are wines and beers for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Great place with very friendly staff, we will definitely visit again.
All necessary amenities are available on site, including parking and billiards.
Well renovated rooms with all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for kids)
Very cool shop of tobacco and hookahs)
We shop here all the time, the prices are low and the quality is top notch!
Very responsive staff, will prompt and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone! ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
For me personally it's normal.
Service is fast if one of the visitors is not stupid.
By appointment is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, direct, advise even if they did not come on visiting days.
Basically okay.
Great guys!
Thanks a lot!
Everything was done quickly, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was for ejection, but they did everything for me so cleverly.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8th.
After 6 hours they brought flowers in a package, as if they had stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
Compared with the photo on the site and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in Votsap answered my indignation about the color and the number of colors, "apparently they mixed up the color."
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of arrogance and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent an application to the tax office about the fact that they refused to issue a check to me.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to deal with this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, for coloring and hair cutting.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always carefully listens to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I wholeheartedly recommend this artist to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!'
Huge thanks to Master Samira 😍
Greetings, I was in this game club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of game computers, there are also drinks and food.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, the buttons fly off, if we take the "normal gameplay" then the computers do not pull well :(
So rating 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition.
The son goes to study in his group, and his mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the trainers are professional.
They arrange themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and work.
A 6-year-old child already holds a blow well, a strong general physical condition.
Recommended for kids, moms and dads
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
Does the job well, caring and takes care of everything.
You can always talk to girls about anything!
It was the third time!
I won't regret anything!
I can finally grow my hair back after bleaching!!!
Vita is also studying color.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine the blonde with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
Master inspector Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained intelligibly everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
She was also very helpful during the repair of my car.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out with high quality.
The only thing that confused me when registering for MOT was insufficiently correct information on the work schedule, when I turned up for MOT, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not part of their duties.
Thanks a lot!
Very kind people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I did not regret that I came to this hairdresser!👍
Master Nahida did an impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Renovated for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, they will be taken / taken away by zootaxi.
And they will bring clean and tasty)
a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Syty Los restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
Delicious meals are prepared.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book places in advance, especially on Fridays!
Nice well maintained zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
Were on weekdays - entrance adult 300₽, student 170.
There were few people, we walked with pleasure, looked at the animals.
Anteater impressed)
in Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with sane prices, the toilet is free of charge, we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!
I am very satisfied with the services of the beautician Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
Satisfied with 100%.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, I picked up cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfect.
Now I'm happy and beautiful!!!
Thanks Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It seems that they come to the club like a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women's section.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I put a three and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I could be wrong.
He arranged everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything was intelligible, the son also decided to draw up a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached his son in the end, who doesn’t care about anything, took him back several times to the negotiation room, something fun discussing, in the end, the son left without filling out anything, for forgiveness, the consultant said, well, whatever you want, as you like, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their range, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are close to the subway and even have a small parking lot.
Recommended!
I was there in September to celebrate my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything in terms of service and quality of food: prices are low, portions of medium size, so you can eat up, or order again.
The only gripe is the table reservation.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I arrived at the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been booked.
We were lucky that there were empty seats and we were able to accommodate.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with excellent value for money.
I recommend!
Went in for a cleaning last weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions as reverently as possible, suggested how and what is best done for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I wholeheartedly recommend, the only clinic where they don’t want to heat up for money in my memory.
Good mall.
There is everything!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
more in this store no foot.
we bought a washing machine, they said that we were out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, to the question "will they load"? said yes. ))
in the warehouse they took it out without a box, to the question why? They replied that everything is loaded like that.
when she began to insist, they put two strips of foam plastic, like, and so it will do!
They refused to load into the trailer, they say it’s not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
when I said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said "yes, whatever you want, we don't care," in the end, one still condescended to go down the ramp and help his father stuff the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I've encountered such rude service.
Good shopping center. Clean neat. Large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Kosmik" and an entertainment center for children "Nevidaliya".
On the ground floor there is a large Lenta hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location.
Good supermarket for cosmetics, lingerie and household goods.
Wide selection, reasonable prices, friendly and helpful staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something for themselves necessary.
Nice place to spend an evening.
Very nice staff, nice place.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in choosing. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go great.
I advise you to visit)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasova, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on a call, she took upon herself the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed how things were going.
Thanks to her, we spent a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of the relatives, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us as a human being.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for all.
Flattered by a lot of good reviews, I turned to RemStirMash and they assigned me the master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
All discussed and appointed time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated application (how is it? But where is "completely free?") And, if he can, instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander, he can come, but after 2 hours.
What are these tricks?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things are on the side!
In short, the sensible master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time.
Evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
At first there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then they looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to watch several times, the adults crowded and could not let others see it.
The objects that we looked through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and without a telescope you can see for free.
The girl answered questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
This amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in town, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit down after eating 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 r👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho is highly recommended to try.
The price is 420 r for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don’t know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely advise my friends to go there)
Great store, I've been buying from them for a long time, since they opened.
Good quality goods.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they did a global renovation in the apartment, everything they needed was taken right here.
Great gas station!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is also a guard of the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I have been refueling 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eaglets on the card and for cash, they do not deceive in terms of displacement.
Store loved it!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help you choose.
I took a laptop to my daughter, for study, because her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
Sommelier works.
he helped with the choice of wine, because in such a large menu it is difficult to figure it out on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
Ate pike perch - magically, respect to the cook.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My ate pizza, it's FIRE here!
With truffle appreciated by adults, and children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We liked.
The brand new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without days off and holidays.
Inside the PVZ there are fitting rooms.
Very good place.
Real professionals who are always ready to help work here.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
I am glad that the product can be seen and tried on immediately.
It's good that it's close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and comfortable.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient check-in, own parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Great puppet theatre.
We often go to different shows.
Today we were at the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, from children's performances, this is the best.
It was very interesting, a lot of puppets, special effects.
Even the son of 14 years old, went just for the company, and said that it was a very good performance.
Rested with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The rest was a success on "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, clarified what time to expect us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, they were issued quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator which is a big plus!
The double room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (no heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a lady's table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, towels and linen are changed at your request, but if you don’t ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-groomed, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
To public transport stop 5 min.
Friendly guys in the dining room always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, everything suited us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, vegetables for garnish every day, pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, grain coffee, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, only cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 C°, the sun was shining.
I liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and it is in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the training complex.
Thanks to the whole team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to Poljot since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising institution - and we did not lose!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovsky hospital with high blood pressure and a high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
Deetite food, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, every single one puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections !!!
While there is a dropper, they will come in and ask about well-being ...
Previously, it was possible to do an ultrasound of the heart, but for the first time (unfortunately, I don’t know the name of the doctor, young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; I picked up the dosage and medications, from which both blood pressure and heartbeat returned to normal, which I could not achieve before after contacting other doctors.
Many thanks to the chief physician Mevshe Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, nurses and cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
In the lobby met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help clients on all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and gave clarifications on my issue.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various trifles.
Open 24 hours, very convenient, always friendly staff
It's great when there is a place in the city where you can ride from the mountains.
Ski lifts and on weekends, of course, the queue is going to be 40 seconds down and 5-10 minutes in line.
But in general it's cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positive and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
Went to a repair shop for an iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was affected, the focus was lost.
Reported the problem right away and got a quick response.
The error was fixed in the shortest possible time, everything works fine.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are acceptable.
If I need another repair, I'll be sure to call!
Big, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the state requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers.
Excellent train station
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to metro by public transport
They opened a nice, cozy place for rest in our area.
There are all necessary shops.
Killer and varied in terms of food food court.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
No crowding.
Well, let's go and try...
The interior has nothing to do with a cozy Italian cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, as in the dining room.
Pizza ... well, whoever has not tried it tastier, he will like it, it seemed to me somehow faceless.
I didn’t really like the fact that the waiter always stands behind your back and your interlocutor, on the contrary, almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
Will not come here again and will not recommend to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best master I have ever had a haircut and makeup.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The salon atmosphere is amazing.
Thanks a lot!
We broke down on the way from Nizhny Novgorod, kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, if only there were more such good people!
And the service is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come back this year for the scheduled concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and accommodating!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
Highest rating, love this place ❤
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more pluses in our park.
Spacious room, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is hospitable.
I did not get bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I'm glad it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Been to the bar twice, I liked everything, polite staff, delicious food and most importantly - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is that the soloist of the Hands Up Band group disappoints for the second time.
Not only does she not sing very well, to put it mildly, she also reads the lyrics of most songs from the phone, she was especially struck when these were the songs of the Hands Up group.
Somehow this is illogical (speaking at the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band group).
We rested at the beginning of March.
Good hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of my birthday I was given a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfasts are just a dump of the head.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to your room, pay a 20% service charge on top.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced.
Three plus for taste.
The water park was included in the price.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the massage therapist was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this in order to keep the brand.
Great place to hang out with friends.
Large and comfortable steam room, billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
Food is delicious, drinks are fresh
Workshop on the level!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wives).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is top notch.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Great basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, I order via the Internet myself.
Excellent store location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
A good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their hospitality!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I go often - everything suits!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and is professional !!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love cupcake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout didn’t make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it’s impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to drink it up and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous brows are here!
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of hair and skin, so that the paint lasts for a long time.
It's better not to do eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
All at the highest level.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family for a long time in Novodent.
We recently treated our son's teeth for 8 years, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues. reception by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something harmful, only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of toppings.
And I don’t understand why, but it never flows with me.
Often when you finish eating shawarma, you don’t eat the bottom anymore, because there is a lot of water sauce, well, in short, fuuuu ...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining room is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, friendly staff, good selection.
However, the big minus is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is not enough space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are standing directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is reverently looked after.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the house of culture.
While we waited in the lobby for the start, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really going out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store by accident.
I called, indicated the VIN code, they said wait)
10 minutes later they called back, offered several options.
Since the car was personally-working, I did not save money and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that good news for you.
If you don’t take the entire basket + disc + clutch, but take the LUK set basket + disc and separately LUK clutch, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Taking the clutch went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it turned out that the flywheel was still needed and the faster the better.
I already knew where I would turn to), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by call (for the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was on hand.
The car is satisfied with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that we went to the meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
Booked a double table, it turned out they put me at a 4-seater.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just weird that they didn't warn you.
Kitchen for four, the fish did not work out at all.
The host with contests made at the school-level powerpoint, to be honest, not very much.
BUT the music is perfect.
The atmosphere was great.
Everything else seems to be nitpicking.
Thanks for the event
I leave my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB department, and in the maternity ward, and in the department after childbirth.
But I express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Yu., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is a midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Great store.
Large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on a recommendation.
The food is amazing, no program, a little cocky waiters, but we were in a great group with children and celebrating an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery supply of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
