Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New flower bed signs encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht in bloom" also includes information about what is currently blooming - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht in Bloom" is an initiative by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. The goal: to create extensive flowering islands in the Geesthacht urban area where insects can find food at any time. "With favorable weather conditions, bees already fly out in January to search for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on his property.
To ensure that the project is not just an initiative of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also extends into private gardens, explanatory panels about the plants are regularly provided. About 50 signs have been placed so far. Passers-by can thus inform themselves about what is currently blooming so beautifully. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately plant these at home.
In the first week of January, the Wildhasel season had already started
More recent additions to the pedestrian zone's flower beds include shrubs such as winter fragrant cherry laurel and winter snowball. They have been planted in the containers along Bergedorfer Street for a year now, showing their first delicate white and pink blossoms without leaves, and have recently been provided with additional signs. "The winter fragrant cherry laurel is a very wide bush and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there, along with other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers. The wild hazel season started in the first week of January. It blooms particularly lushly on Richtweg near the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg, and many hedgerows.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance legend Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to Munich's East Train Station!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 3 pm for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, or rather young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich woman (born January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine it without them."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also hit the dance floor.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the youngest in the group of tap dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeically Tap dance and the French Claquettes. The Spanish Flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family, and everyone is welcome here, young and old, big and small."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With the advancement of digitalization, some people are rediscovering their passion for analog
The rapid pace at which our everyday life has become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapting our communication and work methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, there were three options. Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a call to relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a phone booth. The unforgettable smell of the plastic handset and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person while calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself explained as the reason for her resignation - apparently, she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent, and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu holds a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. Therefore, the confirmation of the new Prime Minister and his cabinet should not pose any problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a big celebration in Veitshöchheim again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't take long to join in.
State leader Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume might suggest. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. By his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja.
Completely off the ground: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to outer space.
State Parliament President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the inspiration for her costume.
In Peace-and-Love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's Golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. By his side, his wife Gerswid.
On tour: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, follows suit.
The political opposition, of course, could not be missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian Lion.
Hiking is the passion of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
It got royal at FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the move as a mime. By his side, his wife Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can always turn to magic. Nuremberg's Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Fast as a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth, and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small jab at climate activists from Franconian crime scene investigator Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim, Jürgen Götz, and his wife Julia were, of course, also present.
Oberhof: Kühn finishes eighth in the World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on-site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent the perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at Rennsteig. On Wednesday, he had already successfully defended his title with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the hunting race number three will follow. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for shooting errors up to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll. After the veteran missed out on a medal opportunity in the mixed relay due to a penalty lap and only managed to secure sixth place, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty laps in the prone shooting and two more standing were a huge disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with a razor-thin 0.7 seconds lead ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has been on the podium once this winter. The Olympic eighth-place finisher from Beijing left wordlessly after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees finished in 19th place, while the second World Championship debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main focus is on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit from his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"Our strong democracy in both of our nations has been tested," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had won against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1st, Lula took office. The transfer of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were released for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say of bourgeois democracy, let's say of late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which usually focuses on troublemakers in the S-Bahn or exhibitionists in the park, has released a new edition featuring the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so interesting, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, as there may be more "Russian friends" in this world, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, instead: In positions 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who still reads this paper. If there is, it's high time now. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing below it.
And by now, at the latest, in good dialectical fashion, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all those who are not yet completely stupefied, i.e., peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militarist people. (And no further differentiation is necessary here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership through his family lawyer at the responsible court. I will not comment on details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, with separation rumors circulating for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marriage problems on the RTL show.
SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor was involved in Franco-German youth encounters, among other things.
A curved layout for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series Northern Lippe Hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents find pure idyll. In summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day sometimes roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even go straight back.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflation rates to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag."
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time in early February and indicated a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The prime rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate, which commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher loan interest rates can lead to postponed investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries like Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more severe than higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep an eye on this, but high levels of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the euro area with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent above the level of the previous year's month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for one euro. Significantly increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also President of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" for infrastructure projects announced by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it. And it might be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge that doesn't necessarily have to be as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval processes for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process to determine what we as a society consider right and wrong.
In the past, they tried using the classic set of rules and didn't succeed. "We should reconsider whether our previous approach was really correct. Maybe we went overboard with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
Considering the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of this energy, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against the breakup of the Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a potential breakup of the Bayer corporation following an announced leadership change. "From the perspective of the employees, Bayer is perfectly positioned with its three pillars to face the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, in the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The reference is to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health sector with over-the-counter medications, and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced change of leadership at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down from his position this summer. Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical head of Swiss rival Roche, is set to take over in early June.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The 2018 acquisition of US seed producer Monsanto for $63 billion continues to haunt the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into their house. The Bayer stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to relieve the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not intend to extend his contract, which was originally supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had been putting pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, have also been involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the corporation.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. "A spin-off of the Consumer Health division could be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, in an interview with the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to protest against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French also plan to take to the streets again to protest the proposed pension reform.
Trade unions are opposing a government project with massive street protests. Hundreds of thousands are expected to demonstrate against pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, over a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been taking place in parliament for a week over the controversial reform.
Already, many people in France work longer than the age of 62 if they have not contributed long enough for a full pension when they reach the retirement age. Opponents of the reform argue that people in many demanding jobs can hardly work any longer. Moreover, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health in their job.
Macron: Looming Deficit in Pension Fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population gets older, employees must cover an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. In order to maintain the level of pensions, the population must work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, the government does not only want to adjust the retirement age. The already decided increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 Euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, with massive protests and strikes already taking place at that time. Several presidents before Macron have tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty for all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, they hope to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And currently, Macron's concern about crippling strikes may be greater than the fear of a close vote. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure system is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high-pressure area shifts a little to the east during the course of next week, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and bring people in the lowlands days of dreary high fog gray, while there is pure sunshine in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges."
The Sunday starts foggy and overcast in most regions. According to DWD, there may still be some rain from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. The cloud cover will loosen up mainly at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west during the day, and the sun will appear more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble at the high fog and dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist. All-day sunshine is expected at the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, while elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees at the Lower Rhine, but only around 3 degrees are expected in the persistent gray in the southeast. A weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may be slow dissipation of fog or high fog again. Otherwise, the weather will be sunny after the fog clears. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW, and at the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day long. Temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees Celsius, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatrix struggles: Still no World Championship medal for Goggia
The heavily favored Sofia Goggia expressed great disappointment after her elimination in the downhill race at the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform as well as I know I can," said the Italian woman on ZDF, after she had missed a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, known for her risky racing style, will have to continue waiting for a World Championship medal in her signature discipline. She missed her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in good shape. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they're not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Since February 10th, Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the release of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for assistance in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on February 10, 2023, around 12:30 pm. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has only very limited German language and local knowledge.

Zelensky and ministers oppose Russia's Olympic participation
Kyiv. With the demand to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed in a joint teleconference to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, according to the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the United Kingdom. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Due to the Russian offensive war, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and not bearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also views Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides military bases for Russian troop attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it intends to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC permits the athletes to compete.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations its rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes participating in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports back to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unrestricted solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa upon request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sports should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, insists that sports and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for the return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "due to a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk it up where it happens
"Hey, nice butt!", whistling at the jester in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting suggestive phrases: All of this falls under the term "catcalling" (German: Katzenrufe). Behind the term lies nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank inventory significantly reduced
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank inventory significantly reduced
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. They are talking about "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has lost an estimated half of its battle tanks in its war against Ukraine, according to the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine is set to receive battle tanks from several Western allies. The United Kingdom has promised Kyiv the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks, although their delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia Wants to Step Up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, and tanks," said Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army position appointments
Because the position, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption in office and abuse of authority. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously vacant position, according to the minister. She does not want to comment on the "speculations of a liberal personnel representative." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying. These have been resolved from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on World War I and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." The decision has the "appearance of cronyism," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still neck-deep in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools buckle under costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to maintain the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital. However, the higher costs, including for security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone make up about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are canceled in Brandenburg. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" (Parade of Happy People) in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been canceled for the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht either.
Despite increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne remains committed to the traditional parade. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. However, financial worries are also pressing here: if more sponsors are not found or the existing ones do not contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped - "this cannot happen every year." The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent in some cases, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Support Association. Fortunately, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the parade will be more expensive. Twice as much staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
Those standing along the parade route at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland might receive fewer candies than before. Due to the increased cost of sweets, some parade participants may not have as much to give out. Regardless of the amount of candy, visitor turnout is expected to be high: "I believe that if it doesn't rain heavily on that day, we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rosenmontagszug for two years. The parade is, of course, irreplaceable."
The Cologne festival committee does not comment on costs in detail. However, the parade is generally "deficit-ridden," which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
Ukrainians are not considered to be heavy drinkers for no reason. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then, I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't taste much difference. The same applies to vodka, which is widespread. They mainly distill it themselves in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much is consumed in the former Soviet republics. A few years ago, the Russian Health Minister claimed that consumption had dropped by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But this only applies if it goes into mass sales. There is probably some adulteration going on.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
Those looking to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or enjoy a beer after work will find great spots in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work gatherings or pre-gaming for club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews will show it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President witnesses favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. However, there were two bright spots in the fog.
As much as the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the grandstand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, referring to the fog that kept rolling into the stadium, severely impairing the view at Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier still enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have been involved since the World Championships were awarded here." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "secure for the next years and even decades."
Once again, Norwegian athlete Johannes Thingnes Bö outpaced the competition in a sporting event. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the perfect Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters could not compete for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs standing this time and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, into the locker room.
Bö started the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and maintained this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, he had the luck of the skilled with his last two standing shots; they each landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In contrast, the German hopes for the women rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as the tenth. It's all about full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said Sports Director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the test. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 pm and 3:30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the field
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on a dropped ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior. Referee chief Fröhlich points out a role model function.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field. "I do think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this - and will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches were also given dismissals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson received a red card during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg's coach Christian Streich was given a yellow-red card in the league defeat in Dortmund. "The behavior of the coaches also falls under the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has increased in this area, and that the behavior towards us referees has become somewhat more demanding or aggressive. We want to consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB Referee Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a generally good relationship between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned has to live with that. It shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during the course of a game. But when emotions spill over into personal insults, one must also accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have resolved the issues afterwards. "What would be important is if a change in thinking overall would take place, that such behavior is simply not acceptable," said Fröhlich at an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on other levels. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race, ahead of the overall leader from Austria, Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia finished third.
The German combined skiers will not compete in the Black Forest with their best lineup. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not participating. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were injured, including two children, in an accident involving four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it into two other vehicles. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition comes to an end at the Marler Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The closing event for the exhibition "Wall-bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 pm in the temporary quarters of the Marler Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over, and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12th by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous visual examples, she will present the unique features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and explore the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, focusing on North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It concerns construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are believed to be responsible for construction defects that may have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The Adana prosecutor's office is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of this investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far. One of the suspects was reportedly arrested at Istanbul airport. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6 magnitude earthquake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has passed away
Hans Modrow has passed away, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Faction leader Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "a significant personality," explained faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification.
The parliamentary group leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of the creation of German unity was precisely one of his special achievements. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It continues:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After the reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically." The German unity was accomplished too quickly, the GDR had disappeared too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv must carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs on the Ukrainian power grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack involving around 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, he reported to his fellow citizens about the significant support Ukraine received during his trip to London, Paris, and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24th, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The danger from Russian missile attacks continued into the night on Saturday. In the capital Kyiv, an air raid alarm was triggered for the fifth time on Friday evening. "A drone attack is imminent," the military administration of the Kyiv region reported. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German Railways: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign to separate these failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and distribute profits.
Backlog of 80 billion euros in renovation
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government in overseeing this process. The backlog of maintenance on the rail network is a major reason why the trains are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. However, according to more recent calculations by the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances apparently did not speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, was "totally excited", and her pulse did not come down even during the warm-up. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championships, "cannot be described in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team embraced each other.
"Enjoy biathlon," that's what she had planned
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter as the only German. She is currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup standings. And even though the performance density among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, other contenders were expected for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting his overthrow together with the US government.
German Armed Forces: Defense industry demands more orders from special funds
First armament projects have already been canceled, and further plans are at risk, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag." However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be specifically affected. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible savings requirement at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background of the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans themselves. As these increase, there is less money available for the actual purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the currently high inflation is causing the purchasing power of the remaining amount to decrease.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 Injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway towards Heilbronn at the Kupferzell motorway entrance. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the turning process of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The total damage to both cars amounted to approximately 20,000 euros.
Castle Square Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's prayer earnestly and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could overcome this disaster. He asked for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other. The community also sought support and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is strong. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations over several days on Glockenstraße, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake-affected areas. The willingness to help there was also overwhelming.
Hike with a meaty twist - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because those who, thanks to the home office, are not in the middle of a stone desert but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests, and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least this impression could be gained around Egglburger Lake, where between 12 and 14 o'clock not only dog owners are bustling about.
One reason could, of course, also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot usage. Because why not learn news from the neighborhood from the long-unseen neighbor while taking a short walk through nature? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? This way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer, or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
Another thing that can be done quite well is the purchase of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which is placed on a table by the roadside along with small cheese boxes. Or potatoes and meat. It's just a pity if you haven't thought about the purchase beforehand and made the necessary preparations. Thus, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden salesroom of the farmer empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money."
The disappointment is understandable, as you have a companion with a wallet but no carrying case. You let the friendly acquaintance know this as well. To which the man replies, "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket you quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the return journey with a meaty addition and, during this midday short excursion, not only gains a lamb back but also an exceptionally practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be necessary on this day - after dinner. This time, actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons not yet clear, veered off the road to the right in a left curve, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guidepost, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop several meters away. The driver was trapped in his car due to the collision. The fire department freed him using heavy equipment. The emergency service transported the severely injured man to a hospital. Since there was suspicion of driving incapacity, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss with damages amounting to 1000 Euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, back then still in office as President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the Ministry's decision on Friday.
In contrast to political customs in the US, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against its release all the way to the Supreme Court. A district attorney's office in New York has since obtained the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there is a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of authorized persons is somewhat larger, and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi stated.
Cabaret at the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from appointment to appointment, sometimes squeezing in people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl demonstrates in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting about it.
In a humorously thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl narrates and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she brings many things to the point - and one or the other can also be found between the lines. The show starts on Saturday, February 18th, at 8:30 pm at the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British high-profile criminal captured in Thailand after a long manhunt
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the United Kingdom has been arrested in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday, the man was apprehended by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most sought-after criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial, according to authorities, in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the Church Table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. This is reflected in the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits well into the prevailing domestic science skepticism remains to be seen. However, his humor certainly fits very well in Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. Now he is back and not only shares his experiences overseas with his German-speaking audience, but also explains what science actually is and what it can do - and most importantly, what it cannot. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, as well as German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, relaxed and very ironic. And so, not only are we well entertained, but we can also learn something along the way.

General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and rock cubes, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended course of the game. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game sequence, the initials input for high scores, and the self-test sequence. The latter mode represents a special sequence for checking the controls and computer function.
Gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game ends. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint could read, for example: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a point becomes visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, representing the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, they can be easily targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN FIRE RANGE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
Occasionally, UFOs will appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless aircraft that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are meant to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot down by the player earns them 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: For a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points, and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank moves and rotates twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks in a game. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined point totals, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more challenging game design. Details and the exact switch positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input for top results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the high score table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply, the high score table will be deleted. When resetting, the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are preserved and re-entered on the screen to challenge further players. Any score over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. SETUP ARRANGEMENT
New Parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you have previous experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this assembly unit more stable and ensuring the proper function of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the middle position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been expanded to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. With the help of this circuit technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console intended as a platform for smaller players to facilitate gameplay. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should perform some checks to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V network. A. Check the outside of the case for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never forcefully make plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a forced guidance system, ensuring a correct connection is made. A 180-degree twisted plug connection will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the embossed production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board, and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console, and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the panel. If the opening is not exactly centered, the panel, which is attached with adhesive tape to the housing, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below you will find a series of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check the system configuration.

It can happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the reason why your program hangs or crashes. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before you start the game. - If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as these can sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system.
Before you install software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly. Then, there is a high chance that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of working much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows help
Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to access Windows Help. 2.

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It represented a way for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental element of human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations. Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has much more demanding and profound content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this respect. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were constantly forced to question many of the principles previously considered inviolable. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass you by without leaving a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game starts for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. The aim is to acquire as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In case of an alarm, the SPARX turn into SUPER-SPARX and become more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your territory, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, as you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marker is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the Video-PC-Board are used.
Programming Display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game operate is selected. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Mission programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" that may be present before the start of the game can be set. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory or basic setting can be reached, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (as the green appearing lines are called) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs in order for their own initials (names) and the hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, if a coin lock is present, the coin acceptance is blocked. This can set a limited number of games for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero if more than 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "maximum credits" to 0. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of marking characters per credit.
"Threshold": The percentage number that must be reached to switch to the next round
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the game process
"Startup sound": no sound at "0" during standby operation
At "1" sound even in stationary operation (animated sound) "Table model": at "0" stationary device
at "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "coin slot programming" display. High score program display ("highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score, which was selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX are set as standard. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear as 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for inserted (converted coins). Granted credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free games: Granted credits (Paid + granted credits per 100) Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes in extended or won game. % Free time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game duration in sec.: Played minutes/paid + granted credits.
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are reset to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Deposit slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the installer can choose a standard coin setting or program another setting.
If a standard setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches selects the programming while the top digit glows green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the top setting number is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed unintentionally, the standard setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switch. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units - "Credit" shows the number of required units before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the standard setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition likely indicates a battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed each time. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is switched off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. With plug J 19 removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are carried out as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM to be replaced is displayed on the LED display. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAM fails during the Video Board test, the error could be due to faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are reset to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these inscriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for star No. 1. The second star is for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle into a S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips...but I could swim in the rest. Also, the lining material already came out when opening the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. It can be worn well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will surely be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
Robust Quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and it's not optimal. Unfortunately, I mismeasured and the pad doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. I slightly altered it so it fits. The pad seems very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not for under one year. The chewing surface is too large for a small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months, we've brought it out again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything off with his few existing teeth. And when it's been in the fridge, it soothes him a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately returning
I was probably misled by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews here. I would like to preface by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it was, but there can be no talk of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Even the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I unfortunately also have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked was the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and then acts like a little child and sulks in every argument?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this was the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many people say. Sure, the story is totally contrived, and always designed according to the same formula. If you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends. And the message is always the same: Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns! And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How often during the movie I thought (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to your eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy animals, the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: none. 4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is primarily "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and can bring one to tears - if one engages with it and expects nothing from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week. It is worth noting that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately only noticed too late), while the larger one got a full 5? That is very very strange!
Terrible smell and poor results! I dyed my blonde hair to a chocolate brown with an intense tint in October, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, the result was not too bad, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (somewhat darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it again, as instructed in the manual for unsatisfactory results. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first attempt. The worst part was, it still smelled weeks after the application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for quite a long time now, always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2. This is working very well. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed more easily. The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not entirely flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very disturbing: 1) Over time, the case has problems "connecting" with the phone. This means that it no longer charges even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These may not be many major defects, but I believe that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function and therefore I am very disappointed with the product for the cost of 30€, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months.
Way too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it's really just a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I expected much more from these cloths, it is also really very thin. Since I have used it, I unfortunately cannot return it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (it has already fallen into the shower), reproduces bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct a star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places, the paint had chipped off and if you just ran your hand over it, the paint would come off in some places. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but how if both dressers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer. Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. Kudos to Amazon.
Better to spend a bit more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product. The included adhesive hardly holds, but it sticks properly - like chewing gum that doesn't harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closures + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors slam due to magnets (can possibly be balanced with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- The supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I had no others and since there was no trophy in the house, I glued them with craft glue) - the brackets for the insert shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points.
It gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. However, the natural sounds are terrible and extremely loud. I couldn't turn them down. Probably a defect, supposedly it's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I would immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. But when it was time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so you don't have to re-enter the time and alarm time in case of a power outage. But for the reasons mentioned, it was returned.
Lighting great, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "Pay for 6 - receive 4" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have handled this generously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color tends more towards cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc. For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light. Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do this too and maybe I will also get intact specimens according to the order there. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received the items, and I would like to share my first impressions. Yes, positive. I thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. **The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand. **All the utensils have a hole in the handle for hanging. **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use with coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They do not conduct heat, so they can be handled directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But a quick wipe and they're gone. In conclusion, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
B-Stock Sold as New Stock
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all parts. We found that the part had already been installed once. We noticed significant scratches and scuffs on all assembly parts. The hose connections/fittings were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only then did we see that there were also scratch marks / streaks on the chrome faucet itself. This part was probably already delivered and returned. We will keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. I find it simply sad that customers are being deceived like this!!!
The product itself is top-notch, unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the range is very good, with no problems transmitting from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the outside values seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, as it continues to display plausible values. However, the hygrometer seems to be gone, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values of outside humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected place and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with weak catcher
Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression. The engine is strong and it produces a nice cut. The noise level is not impressively low, but okay. The big drawback is unfortunately the grass catcher. For one, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you set it down briefly when it's full, it naturally gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the otherwise practical fill level indicator already shows red when the grass catcher is only half full. This wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from that point on. Emptying the catcher on a large lawn area when it's only half full can't be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable, which can be extended if necessary, is very good. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is quite fiddly to close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed correctly to this day. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there, and the screw on the front right is practically falling out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything like this. Regarding the assembly: The assembly was quite trouble-free, it would only be helpful to show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received a reply. Unfortunately, returning it is no longer possible. I had expected a bit more.
Robust and precise, I'm positively surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed. This one here makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the caliper is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. From me, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and initially did not wear it because it emitted a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it was constantly "aired out". Since return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it. I advise against buying it.
Okay for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too big for me, making it look quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is overall very simply made, so I have already torn the clasp twice. So far, I have always been able to repair it, but I think that it will not last/hold for long. But for the low price, you simply cannot expect anything really high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more pliable. Just a note: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some fiddling.... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, not usable for me! The thing went back! I would definitely advise against buying, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted. I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and the current pump lasts a bit longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, as mentioned above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
It could have been better thought out. As I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than constantly carrying around a huge bunch of keys. Initially, everything went quite well. However, the paint quickly started to peel off and the screws had to be constantly tightened. It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't have immediately ruined the entire screw. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths using the various parts, but once you've screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance, and skill. Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I assembled it, rendering the entire thing useless. Conclusion: If at all, then only for once all necessary keys and then never again, but at the price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Does not quite match the specified dimensions
The zippers are smooth, the material seems sturdy, and all of this at a featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to truly assess the product after the first use. I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything for a three-week vacation there. If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, as there were two smaller bags/pouches included in the round cosmetic bag. Not high-quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So, I might as well have thrown the money directly into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not discern an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life lasts a very long time. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
Chic dress
A very beautiful dress that is suitable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slim upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Stay away. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized at best unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes grinding noises as you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't get any better or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or do anything at all. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First and foremost, I want to point out that the two USB ports are somewhat deceptive, as only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the aesthetics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like it would with a normal extension cord. So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is somewhat limited :-).
Small but powerful! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via BT and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. It doesn't fit with my case and the adapter. Well, it holds securely and has contact anyway... All in all, a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, it's very small and sturdily made from a piece of aluminum. The price-performance ratio is right.
Plenty of power
Top device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle temperature setting a bit too cool and therefore always use level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not give a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the location is accurate to about 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does tend to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste, the battery doesn't need to last that long for us and we find changing it daily impractical. You should be spending time with your dog, not with his collar :-). The app also works perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more. Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair, it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair. These, however, appear poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I previously owned. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly made and the heel strap is quite loose and will likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I test laid it in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it does not reappear. A lying test was carried out in the inflated state. It is comfortable to lie on and is perfect for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We removed the seats in the back beforehand. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). Since my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the pump worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am looking forward to the stress test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar tore open on day 1 due to poor craftsmanship, revealing several doors. By the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts as they were practically falling out. The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car to attach the parts. Once the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5 min. flight time is usually more than enough. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly at this price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. Nice contact for questions.
The game is okay but can only be played with mandatory use of Steam. I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it wasn't a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which certainly wouldn't be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance were great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The operation worked well.... and yet I am sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its lifespan. Charged in the evening, left on the shelf overnight and 11% less battery in the morning without use. If many messages came during the day, the battery was already depleted by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore, it's not useful for me. Very unfortunate.
Elegant case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case. I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert a credit card. This case offers that. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case seems sturdy and well made. It looks elegant. The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, with only cutouts at the connections. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO, it doesn't work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, it's really chic and well made!
High-quality case with tempered glass film
A robust case with a proper armored glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11. It fits very well and can also be easily applied. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits tightly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.

Morbus Still was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, the disease only begins in adulthood, which is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.
The diagnostic criteria include a characteristic rash, joint pain, fever episodes, and leukocytosis, as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and the absence of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a longer period, whose skin manifestations led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.

In 25-30% of cases, the respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
For diagnosis, medical history, lung X-rays, and blood tests are often not very helpful.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the airways leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation), and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
The flexible bronchoscopy with the performance of a bronchoalveolar lavage provides diagnostic clarification in 60-80% of cases, while the remaining cases - with appropriate clinical presentation - must be diagnosed through a mostly open lung biopsy.
Affected are predominantly women of younger to middle age.

A review of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult-to-reposition mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly displaced fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can also be successfully treated using monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
A suitable differential indication between the two therapy concepts seems to be the collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters that describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a ranking value for the classification of trauma.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for describing a mandibular trauma that all previously conducted studies with their low case numbers can only provide a rough differential indication.
Until a prospective multicenter study is available that could provide decision support in choosing the osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to the functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid area between "simple" and "difficult" fractures.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that enables comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representations of DNA segments.
In order to make quantitative and reproducible statements about genetic aberrations, a software has been developed that enables the objective recording of the location and type of changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH summary karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype based on sum karyograms, thus achieving a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical procedures can be precisely planned and simulated using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bone structures, created from the tomography data of a patient.
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned procedure and in spatial orientation within the surgical site.
After successfully centralizing laboratory analytics for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurements in undiluted whole blood, and the miniaturization of laboratory analyses are increasingly leading to a renewed decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) is performed near the patient, outside of central or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT include faster turnaround times (TAT), quicker medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and transportation issues, and the need for only small sample volumes.
These advantages are often emphasized, but they do not come with a clearly recognizable clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analyzers by untrained station staff, insufficient or missing calibration and/or quality control, costs due to the provision of multiple devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation, and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also evident.
In the authors' opinion, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians to ensure the meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Considering the local situation (24-hour central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes should be:
Hemoglobin or hematocrit, activated whole blood coagulation time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia, and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures through MRI is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
A prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultra-fast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents, and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MRI is still in the early stages of development.
Magnetic resonance tomography may potentially gain significant importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
In patients with chronic kidney insufficiency, characteristic skeletal changes occur.
The aim of the present study was to completely record the changes in bone mass of the spine in long-term hemodialysis from C2 to L5.
From 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, complete examinations of the spine were conducted.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, allowing the underlying three-dimensional structure to be analyzed directly alongside the histological image.
The vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV), and intertrabecular connectivity (TBPf) were quantitatively evaluated.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral body fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) within the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control group.
However, the plateau-like curve progression from the cervical spine to the lumbar spine is about 5% lower for the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd lumbar vertebra ranges between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with longer hemodialysis show higher BV/TV values, regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV does not necessarily mean physiological interconnection of the spongiosa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP shows a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be derived from the 2-D slice planes and trabecular bone volumes.
The findings emphasize the importance of effective prophylaxis for maintaining an orderly and functional spongiosa architecture in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, French surgeon Alexandre de Littré first described a form of inguinal hernia that, due to its course of disease and the autopsy findings raised by Littré himself, did not correspond to what was previously known.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described in a scientific paper about "ruptures" the intestinal wall rupture, probably providing the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré hernia" in the German-speaking area.
A case report is used for the historical processing of this type of hernia.
Asperger's Syndrome is an autistic disorder, first described in 1944 by Hans Asperger, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the disease received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disturbance is unclear.
A patient is presented with the typical characteristics of Asperger's Syndrome, who also had epilepsy and internal medical abnormalities.
Possible comorbidities of Asperger's Syndrome, such as epilepsy, are discussed alongside diagnostic criteria and therapeutic approaches.
Yersinia infections in children usually manifest as feverish gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
A case is reported of a child with a Yersinia infection manifesting as a tumor-like lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was made by repeatedly detecting specific antibodies against various external Yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after a 16-week therapy with Ciprofloxacin did all clinical findings normalize.
The application of pulse oximetry in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated in 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were investigated, which conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and what consequences result from these findings.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be highly suitable for quality control of the performed resuscitation measures.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be implemented as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not determine the cause of death.
At this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented, demonstrating the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy, fever, and subsequently septic shock developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy.
In this autologous blood sample, Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second one.
The contamination source of the canned goods could not be identified.
It turns out that autologous hemothotherapy also carries a not-to-be-underestimated risk of infection and the retransfusion of one's own blood requires strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a severe infection caused by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association who developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis after a Candida sepsis, leading to hydronephrosis with incipient postrenal kidney failure.
Under antifungal therapy with Amphotericin B and Flucytosine, as well as direct flushing with Amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy, the excretion function normalized.
With the increasing frequency of systemic Candida infections, particularly in neonatology, the differential diagnosis for nephrolithiasis should also consider the possibility of bezoar formation in order to initiate early and effective therapy.
The high-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for treating acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some patients do not respond or respond inadequately to this therapy.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-responders each were compared.
No significant differences were observed between both groups regarding the following parameters:
Skin type, minimal erythema dose, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, it was shown that non-responders had a significantly increased atopy score, elevated levels of total IgE, and specific IgE compared to responders.
Additionally, a comparatively higher frequency of strong colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestine with Candida albicans was observed among non-responders.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective for all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized by both a particularly severe atopy syndrome and complicating superinfections.
The latter finding suggests that for these patients, a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with an antibiotic or antifungal treatment may be beneficial.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
Using two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is demonstrated.
Clinically, there are subcutaneous nodular and plaque-like infiltrates, which can lead to ulcerations and scarred retractions.
Histologically, a lobular panniculitis is found.
Another diagnostic indication is a positive direct immunofluorescence examination (Lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM, and complement components at the dermo-epidermal junction and the vessels.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance, as lupus erythematosus profundus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
The report covers clinical and morphological findings in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has persisted for over 45 years.
The patient passed away with clinical signs of a cardiac low-output syndrome due to an autopsy-confirmed and toxicological analysis-verified vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy.
The pathogenesis, morphological, and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of the development of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapy methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
In this review article, the results of experimental and clinical studies on the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for low-energy internal atrial cardioversion are summarized.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, at an advanced age, with limited cardiac pump function, after previous heart surgeries, and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires a risk stratification, which allows the surgical risk to be divided into "low", "medium", and "high".
Pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and treatment-related factors can be distinguished.
Based on this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra-, and postoperative, multiprofessional, and interdisciplinary organized management.
The patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucous membrane tumors, especially spinaliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, one spinalioma, and a lymph node metastasis of a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of Xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complementation analysis, which assigned it to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with untreated malignant tumors for years, which have ulcerated in the meantime on the breast, chest wall, and/or abdominal wall, present plastic surgeons with the need for large defect coverage after successful tumor resection.
By using silver-containing activated carbon nonwoven fabric (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer dressings (Allevyn), an infection was prevented after flank replacement with an omentum plasty as part of the resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum led to a stable abdominal wall even without the use of synthetic meshes.
The Health Reform 2000 in Germany changes little about the structural deficits of the German healthcare system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and contracted physicians for outpatient care will not be affected.
The hospital's budget remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be provided for outpatient surgeries that cannot be performed in an inpatient setting.
The obligation for quality assurance is clarified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure represent a complex immunological process, which is influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide, and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
On the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
The inflammation is intensified by the activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA encoding for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8, and inducible NO-synthase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and system-wide.
By characterizing this immune reactivity, one may ultimately gain a better understanding of the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually nonspecific.
Radiologically, bone brightening is often visible, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radio-opacities.
Root resorption can be another important finding.
After a brief historical overview, the current state of knowledge for each individual type is discussed, based on the currently valid WHO classification.
From this, the currently valid therapy concept is developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
Malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent, and non-recurrent tumors.
The generalized cheerfulness disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness often recognized late, characterized by a uniformity of emotional experience in the face of circumstances that would normally cause depressive mood, despair, great fear, self-accusation, or aggression directed towards others.
An early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life for the affected person and prevent negative individual and societal long-term consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis remains a life-threatening disease to this day, requiring rapid diagnosis and immediate therapy initiation.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapy regimen specifically targeting the pathogenesis of inflammation is capable of minimizing neurological sequelae and preserving the patient's life.
In this article, the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy is presented, with particular consideration of molecular pathophysiological processes in the inflammation of the central nervous system.
The CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (Dental-CT/Denta-Scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in distinguishing bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows for a precise evaluation of the complicated details of the oral cavity.
By using this technique, an accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital, and neoplastic lesions, is made possible.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), a causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of currently available studies on oral IC therapy have not been conducted in a randomized, double-blind, or placebo-controlled manner and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
Until today, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical image of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin changes and clinically resemble Darier's dyskeratosis follicularis, seborrheic keratoses, or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and faulty keratinization.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin changes and must be distinguished from severe, congenital keratinization disorders that show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic substances are often used in cardioanesthesia during procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) today.
However, there are also concerns about their potential as triggers for thrombotic complications.
In this context, the effectiveness of Aprotinin and Tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass should be compared.
The imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis is described in a 64-year-old patient.
The involvement of the manubriosternal joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics, and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
Between January 1994 and June 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy for endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the "Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study."
In this retrospective study, the functional outcomes of surgical treatment were to be examined.
Heinrich Heine experienced an episode of Pseudologia phantastica during his childhood.
The conditioning factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this work.
The effectiveness and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis, as well as the therapy effect depending on the HLA B27 characteristic, are to be examined.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms since the age of 14 is presented.
This is not an independent compulsive disorder, but rather a schizophrenia masked by compulsive symptoms.
Under the therapy of exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms in the 31st year of life with clozapine, neither psychotic symptoms nor significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms are found in the one-year follow-up.
While the literature increasingly points to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mainly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, this paper - as far as the author is aware - describes the rare case of improved obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia due to clozapine treatment.
The importance of differential diagnosis of compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of a single case.
An isomorphic stimulus effect (Koebner phenomenon) refers to a disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli.
A report on the triggering of a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient through UV-B light testing with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
Additionally, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis lesions developed in the viral efflorescences after a varicella infection.
Since the individual was planning a several-month stay abroad in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical, and laboratory chemical examinations were conducted.
The presentation was made to rule out an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to investigate the possibility of genetic risk factors for developing such a disease, and to determine whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a result of vaccination.
Initial experiences and results with 13 single-stage reconstructions of large complex defects in the head and neck area using 8 microvascularly anastomosed forearm transplants and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major island flaps are reported.
Complete loss of flaps did not occur in any case.
With the free forearm transplant, better functional and aesthetic results were achieved, but the surgery times required for the reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap include poor moldability and a limited rotation radius.
It was used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the application of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a higher risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli, which can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically involves the activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This allows the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has primarily been considered a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, recent evidence suggests that exogenous factors can also induce endothelial cells into an inflammation-prone state without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are not only subject to the control of tissue-specific mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgeries, indicate a need for the local administration of rTPA.
We report on our results.
Presented is a case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node, first described 5 years ago and not yet documented in German-language literature (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
Diagnostic criteria include the structure of sectionally arranged palisade-like myofibroblastic cells (with immunohistochemical positivity for vimentin and actin), peripherally accentuated hemorrhage zones, and the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is significant for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
By increasing the strength of 2 parallel inner rails, obstruction and kinking were reduced, and a regression of congestion in the proximal hollow system was achieved.
Furthermore, this technique allows for increased flow between the stents in addition to the urine flow within the stents, which is considered a crucial mechanism for urine passage in lying ureteral stents.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression, where the insertion of a singular internal stent does not achieve sufficient regression of the ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral stents should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative, which can save some patients from the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis), the intradiscal application of chymopapain represents the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful consideration of the indications and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis allows for an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
The value of diuresis sonography compared to the diuresis nephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorders should be investigated in a prospective study.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas.
The method has been further developed and modified over the past 20 years.
Currently, there are three variations to choose from:
All three methods have the same goal:
Radical tumor removal while preserving the surrounding non-affected tissue.
However, they show significant differences in terms of tumor excision technique, histological section attachment, and histological specimen evaluation.
A methodical inventory is carried out, and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between the primary trauma and malignant transformation is approximately 30 years.
The "Marjolin Ulcer" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior compared to other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with a lesion on the right back of the hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after a correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedicled A. radialis flap.
Spinal opioids provide effective analgesia for various surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
In this case, fewer central and systemic side effects occur than with the epidural application of local anesthetics or the parenteral administration of opioids.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain management are demonstrated, including within the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient controlled analgesia").
The intrathecal administration mode is attributed with various advantages compared to the epidural one.
A variety of factors play a role in choosing the opioid.
It seems that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
Regarding the quality of analgesia, serious side effects, the amount of administered opioids, or postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of a thoracic injection compared to a lumbar injection.
There is evidence to suggest that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with high preoperative risk and is also cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized patch tests at the participating centers are centrally recorded in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19,678 patients) were retrospectively analyzed separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Peru balsam, and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also created for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema localization, geographical region, profession, sensitization) and specific questions.
In this case, significantly fewer positive reactions were observed for nickel, fragrance mix, and Peru balsam in men compared to women.
Younger patients responded more frequently to Thiomersal, while older patients responded to medical externals.
Medical allergens were also frequently found positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were more common in those with hand eczema.
In individuals with nickel and fragrance mix allergies, higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens were found compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thimerosal reactions was often not recognizable.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of diagnostics and prevention of contact allergies.
In approximately 95% of all people infected (or exposed) to M. leprae, the disease does not manifest openly.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection, but by the T-cell-mediated immune response.
In this review article, current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinical features, reactions, treatment, and diagnosis of leprosy are considered.
Recently, numerous studies have been presented on the quantitative investigation of the Tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (AH) using laser Tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison to the Tyndall intensity in KW for uveitis of different localizations, it should be examined to what extent the Tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disturbance.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of Acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on neurological deficits following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglycolides, caprolactones, and other polyglycolic acid-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are essential for the regeneration of neurites.
Positive results from animal experiments do not hold up under clinical review, as inferior regeneration performance can occur in animal experiments despite impaired regeneration pathways.
The morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term consequences represents the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, one-third developed cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter of cases, chronic complaints and long-term consequences of ascending genital infections occurred over time.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) was included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but rather it usually occurs before the actual symptoms appear.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed more frequently.
Complications during pregnancy mainly include premature contractions (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, also preterm birth.
A progression of maternal HIV infection due to pregnancy was not observed.
Risks for peripartum infection transmission to the fetus include advanced HIV infection in the mother with high HIV-RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia, and CD4+ cell depletion, as well as obstetric factors associated with birth such as prematurity, preterm labor, amniotic infection, duration of membrane rupture and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of an increased mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission rate can be reduced through antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by a primary low-contamination cesarean delivery (4-6%), and most successfully by primary cesarean section combined with prepartum, intrapartum, and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells play a central role in the initiation of the immune response, as they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T-lymphocytes via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical trials on patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized in vitro with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since there is little fundamental data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function in laryngeal carcinoma, the present study investigated the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis using immunohistochemistry.
The results show that, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells are primarily detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When comparing clinical parameters, it is evident that patients with a low number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma (<100 cells/mm2) had the shortest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma represents a favorable prognostic factor for the disease.
An elevated homocysteine level is considered a significant factor in the increased incidence of arteriosclerosis in patients with chronic kidney insufficiency.
In the present study, in addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways, transsulfuration (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methylmalonate, and 2-methylcitrate), were determined in patients with renal insufficiency.
We report on 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The presumptive diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the medical history and the typical findings of lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
To gain insight into the frequency and clinical presentation of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of patients treated at a university outpatient clinic or a dermatologist's practice between 1984-94 was conducted using patient records and, in some cases, follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was 0.05% according to this.
Out of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The average age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, and the average duration of illness was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of patients had atopy, 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic, and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were only positive in individual cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (Penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or Tetracycline 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), 13 patients achieved complete remission and 8 experienced improvement.
In 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%), a spontaneous remission occurred over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment success with antibiotic therapy emphasizes the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary: The case of a 56-year-old female patient is reported, who initially presented with lower back pain.
Both laboratory, radiological, and histopathological findings primarily indicated the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, a dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeatedly obtained biopsy samples, histologically, the image of a nonspecific inflammation was found.
Only during the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal was a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma detected histologically.
Chemotherapy was performed according to the CHOP regimen and radiation therapy was administered.
Lymphomas of the spine should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive courses.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or fractures of the frontobasis in over 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures occur in up to 70% of cases through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa.
There are different concepts for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures as well as combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
Between 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial, and Facial Surgery at the Cantonal Hospital Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without involvement of the skull base, the repositioning and treatment were performed via a subcranial approach.
47 patients were followed up for up to 4 years and their data were evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for the extra- and transcranial treatment of fractures of the ethmoid bone involving the skull base and midface is presented.
However, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding during and after surgery.
In a 50-year-old obese patient with familial hypophosphatasia and suspected phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be treated surgically.
During the intraoperative period, there was a sudden drop in end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2, and circulatory arrest.
Immediate resuscitation measures were initiated, including chest compressions and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was completed with a temporary wound closure, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In the case of a fulminant pulmonary embolism, a systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed while continuing cardiac compression.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics were achieved with continuous, maximum-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
As a result of lysis and coagulopathy, massive transfusion was required.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was able to be transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of "pulmonary embolism" was made based on the clinical examination, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and EKG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were omitted.
During anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic Sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total administered amount is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting peak serum levels of inorganic fluoride is mainly determined by the hepatic defluorination rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered, and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficient.
In a large number of experimental and clinical studies, the question was investigated whether the fluoride exposure from sevoflurane could lead to an increased risk of renal complications.
Neither in animal experiments, nor in clinical routine use or during prolonged anesthesia duration, nor in application in patients with renal insufficiency, could an increased renal risk potential for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane be detected.
The recently proven low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol/l, which has been used in the literature so far, was derived from historical experiences with methoxyflurane but has no validity in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those encountered following anesthesia with sevoflurane, can be considered clinically safe.
There are no experimental or clinical indications for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance.
The best results are achieved by performing a base-parallel lamellation of the heart ventricles after fixation and a transverse lamellation of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if no post-mortem coronary angiography can precede.
With this approach, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, longitudinal, circumferential, and transmural extent of infarctions, their age, and subsequent conditions can be better detected and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than with the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the bloodstream.
The degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occlusive thromboses can be assessed just as intact on the coronary arteries as the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This approach is particularly important in cases of acute cardiac death and short-lived territorial ischemia.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can be detected in correlation with coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
Newer prospective randomized studies show, however, that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection does not provide any additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and stomach have not been conclusive so far.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, no convincing prognosis benefit from preoperative radiation, chemotherapy, or combined radio-/chemotherapy compared to resection alone could be demonstrated in several phase III studies.
A survival advantage with this multimodal approach can only be expected if there is a response to the pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio/chemotherapy improves the response rate for at least squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out within the framework of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This unusual childhood disease is typically only associated with certain metabolic disorders.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptom formations are understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Non-assimilable memories of traumas have a retraumatizing effect and must be defended against, for example through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behavior, or social "acting out."
On this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences from hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
During the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers are created in a resource-oriented way through imagination.
The actual trauma work involves a measured, stable confrontation, but with as little retraumatization as possible, approaching the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and leaving behind.
In the final phase, the focus is on resource-oriented turning towards creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years in terms of diagnoses and the proportion of students with multiple disabilities.
A chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have various causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor cerebri"), a venous outflow obstruction may be a possible cause.
It was investigated to what extent visual acuity remains stable in the long-term course after vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy, and which causes and risk factors for a deterioration of visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entry point.
After inoculation, HIV replication can begin within 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the entire body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can detect an impending HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, and the antibody response is weakened under therapy;
With nucleic acid tests, detection is possible from around the eleventh day.
In nearly 100 years of development, countless native, foreign, and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central third of the patellar tendon, a quadrupled tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis), and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some limitations, the use of cadaver transplants is also justified.
The individual transplants show specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation, and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the mentioned transplants could not be verified.
In the selection of transplants, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account.
In the treatment of complex ligament injuries and in revision cases, careful preoperative planning with possibly modified graft selection is required.
The rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed twice in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological examination revealed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands in each case, with no evidence of pleomorphic adenoma components.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy, and histological features are discussed, taking into account the literature.
Coronary calcification is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance varies depending on whether the calcium screening is performed in patients with known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant aspect of coronary heart disease.
In this study, the frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects regarding ergometry are presented, as well as indications for prognostic evaluation and implications for practice.
We report on 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, both diseases occurred in the context of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we did not observe any cases of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
In patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, further diseases from the spectrum of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II should be ruled out.
Securing the airways after surgeries in the upper respiratory tract can be problematic for certain patients.
Therefore, care must be taken to ensure a safe reintubation if necessary.
The report discusses two patients who, due to a recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma and an inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma, experienced significant intubation difficulties and thus had high risk factors for intubation and possible reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiber-optic placed endotracheal guidewire served as a postoperative or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of laryngeal tumors.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor spread pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration, and their consequences for staging and therapy are essential for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive examinations for detecting neoplastic infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space, the paraglottic space, the subglottis, and the cartilage.
However, the specificity with both methods is lower than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two imaging techniques is clinically important, as it allows for the exclusion of neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable information on possible etiology, the extent of submucosal growth, and the appropriate biopsy site.
The implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) reduces the cardiovascular mortality of patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with terminal renal insufficiency have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There is limited data on myocardial revascularization using PTCA in patients with chronic dialysis dependency, which overall suggests a high peri-interventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We examined the restenosis rate in 23 patients with terminal renal insufficiency (17 men, 6 women, average age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After a primarily successful PTCA, all patients underwent a recoronary angiography within 6-12 months.
Before angiographic control, 12 patients complained about the recurrence of anginal symptoms.
In laboratory tests, patients had hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) and a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient is described, who experienced complete pelvic instability within a year due to increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.
A minor trauma to the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed as the triggering event.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, the initial differential diagnosis was primarily focused on the suspicion of a malignant event.
A wide range of different medical conditions can be the cause of hip pain in childhood.
Primarily, non-traumatic causes are included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinical presentation, and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other hand.
Through exemplary examples, some common as well as rarer disease patterns are demonstrated.
The iatrogenic fracture of the trochanter major during prosthetic treatment of femoral neck fractures appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "posterior approach" could be predisposing factors.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated and, for comparison, traumatic trochanter avulsion, even in cases of significant fragment displacement.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care continues to be a controversial topic.
The present study examines the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy, and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of various methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three aspects of patient satisfaction validity are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
Using the ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patients' further utilization behavior, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
Here it becomes apparent that the correlation between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
In further utilization behavior, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The connection between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly evident for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The observed effects are relatively large, but when viewed in absolute terms, these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in the aging process of men resemble changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels generally decrease with age, correlations between complaints in middle and older age and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men, and various influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea for five days was subjected to a sonography before the planned lysis therapy, based on nuclear medical evidence of a stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
In this case, a floating right atrial thrombus was found.
In cases of acute vital threat, an ultra-high-dose short-term streptokinase therapy (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely dissolved and the leg thrombosis had largely resolved.
The treated patients were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
In 50% of the patients, a single fracture was identified, while the remaining patients had either accompanying injuries or multiple traumas.
The average hospitalization duration was 17 days, and the use of crutches lasted for an average of 21 weeks, indicating a relatively fast healing process.
In the majority (85%), the treatment proceeded without complications.
A chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with open fractures in 9 cases (1.8%) and in patients with closed fractures in only 2 cases (0.4%), which is within the usual norms.
Based on our results and experiences, we believe that the treatment of femoral diaphysis fractures with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and shows comparable results to other treatment procedures.
The extent of distant metastasis diagnosis in head and neck tumors is still a subject of controversy.
In the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract were examined to determine which factors influence the frequency and location of distant metastasis.
In a total of 130 patients (12.0%), distant metastases were diagnosed during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastases positively correlated with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001) as well as with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a second tumor outside the ENT area (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumor location' and 'histopathological tumor grading' did not have independent predictive value, but rather reflected the different frequencies of tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in tumors of categories T1-3 N0 can be limited to an X-ray examination of the thorax.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy, and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, are indicated for locally advanced tumors, recurrences, and secondary tumors outside the ENT area.
However, in each individual case, one should always ask the question about the therapeutic consequences.
In this article, a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the 19th century to the present day is provided.
Ernst Simmel was part of a small circle of early psychoanalysts who, with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy," sought to apply psychoanalytic principles in clinical medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of the first psychoanalytic outpatient clinic in 1919 in Berlin and the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in 1927 in Germany.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism and the consequences of various historical divisions within professional societies.
He is a credible cross-generational professional political figure, especially for the new specialist in "Psychotherapeutic Medicine."
However, the emphasis on Simmel should not lead to the neglect of the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine who were forced to leave Germany due to their Jewish descent and should still be duly remembered.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurring hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, panoramic radiographic, and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry plays a central role in this context.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis of all available randomized, controlled trials in which dexamethasone alone or in combination with other antiemetics was used for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in the context of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed long-term through systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to one-sided compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since a herniated disc occurs in more than 80% of cases on the side of the compression, a causal relationship can be assumed.
As this disorder also narrows the intervertebral foramen, the space shortage during a herniated disc becomes even greater.
The treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This surgery, developed for malignant changes in the area of the pancreatic head, is very extensive and associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be performed on the patients in a blood-saving and almost complication-free manner.
During a median follow-up period of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, while one patient who underwent surgery for a gastrinoma still had elevated gastrin levels detected in the late postoperative period.
Compared to the preoperative functional testing, it was found that the endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly impaired by the surgery.
With strict indication, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can be treated adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications, and without lasting impairment of exocrine and endocrine functions through a duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method for treating symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardic heart rhythm disorders.
Approximately one in six patients dies subsequently after pacemaker implantation due to sudden cardiac death, which is predominantly attributable to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart can pose a risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.
In particular, in cases of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-induced R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences, and perception defects, for example during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger life-threatening secondary tachyarrhythmias.
Considering that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the involved pathomechanisms and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but also even safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e., determining the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative intent, or to define those cancer carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are referred to alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
The computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), the sonography of the upper abdomen, and the skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for the staging of bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, such as those regarding thoracic wall infiltration, and for patients with a contrast agent allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography with [18F]2-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (FDG-PET) for assessing lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111-Octreotide/Somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, and Thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical significance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumors.
Methods currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor receptors, could play an important role in the staging of bronchial carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdominal cavity, retroperitoneum, and small pelvis, there may be damage to the nerves and blood vessels of the sexual organs.
As these patients are often in a sexually active and reproductive age, special attention is given to the prevention of such side effects during tumor therapy.
Impairment of erection or ejaculation disorders may occur after surgical, radiation, or drug therapy for various tumors.
Through a thorough understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now avoidable in a high percentage of cases.
If damage to the corresponding nerve pathways cannot be avoided due to the required radical nature of the surgical intervention to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunction is a significant limitation of quality of life for these patients in sexually active and also reproductive age.
Both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated in almost all cases through a variety of therapy modalities.
The subclavian artery is increasingly being used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of neck vessels at different cannulation sites.
A report about a truck driver who experienced crush trauma to both legs and developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) while under medication thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin.
In addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets and positive antibody detection against heparin:
During our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed, and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically split on the left lower leg.
After excluding possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin-platelet factor-4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous access with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin, 36 days after the accident, the patient exhibited a full-blown anaphylactic reaction, which was immediately interrupted by the administration of cortisone.
We postulate that the thrombocytopenia otherwise described as characteristic for HIT is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which occurs on the cell surface of platelets.
Accordingly, a proposal for a new classification of the various forms of Heparin allergy Type I-IV is made.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without platelet drop, and Type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
The basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the "Histological Typing of Salivary Gland Tumors" by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991.
The original description is attributed to Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
In 90% of cases, the parotid gland is the location of this tumor.
Oral manifestations are only described as case studies;
The case presented here involves a middle-aged woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of a surgical tumor excision with a sufficient safety margin and histologically controlled tumor-free status of all resection margins.
Based on current knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma has a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after the initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present study, a modified animal experimental model of kidney xenotransplantation was developed, within which the course of a highly reproducible hyperacute rejection reaction is observed.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs onto Wistar rats as recipient animals, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, vena cava, and ureter drainage via stenting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on kidney xenotransplants.
In total, 24 xenotransplantations were performed and randomized with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3-ml bolus (treatment group) therapy.
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in terms of prolonging graft survival time (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was observed in the sCR1 group, which can be attributed to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
Just 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, histological examination of the control group showed massive platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries, and interstitial infiltrates.
The kidney transplants treated with sCR1, on the other hand, showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 minutes.
The immunohistological study showed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and interstitium in the therapy group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic procedures on the gallbladder, stomach, colon, and inguinal hernia have been performed in our facility using a robot arm for optical guidance controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is directly determined by the operator's commands in this case.
In all procedures, the control of the robot arm was precise, the speech recognition accurate, and without technical issues.
29 procedures were able to be performed by a single surgeon as "solo surgery."
In an additional 20 procedures, only one assistant was used alongside the surgeon.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The investigation of vascular complications through DSA in kidney and pancreas transplantations requires an invasive procedure in mostly diabetic-damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be considered in differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of Coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in collaboration between the trauma surgery and medical clinic of Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic approach using imaging and microbiological methods allows for targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of operative endoprosthetic hip joint replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapy results and discussion of the literature, the presented approach is successful, concerning both the local treatment of the infection and the functional outcome.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life for a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
The electrical atrial cardioversion is clinically applied, without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the procedure existing so far.
Newer measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization, which favor the interruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications in clavicle fractures are rare.
They appear as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
A case report discusses the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus due to a clavicular fracture with nonunion and excessive callus formation.
Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease and often occurs in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our study was the determination of the coincidence of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes in the patient population of the diabetes outpatient clinic at the Children's Hospital of TU Dresden.
It is reported about a granulomatous inflammatory reaction after using absorbable interference screws for fixation of a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, which led to a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was observed in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was a sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Primary renal plasmacytomas are a great rarity.
So far, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
Presented is a 64-year-old patient, in whom a surgically removed kidney tumor was histologically proven to be a plasmacytoma.
Based on this case, the approach to this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with kidney involvement, nephrectomy is only indicated for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
In a multicentric, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, a treatment indication or appropriate therapy method corresponding to the fracture type was chosen for 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
So far, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known that follow the pattern of Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al. described
[40] 5 patients with an acquired linear, atrophic, and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are a stripe-like skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without an inflammatory precursor and without subsequent sclerosis or other anomalies.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes behavioral guidelines and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be safely carried out as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained through practicing simple movement sequences, and basic knowledge about anatomy, arthritis development, and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors is conveyed.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis has been proven in a prospective randomized study.
For a successful and long-lasting knee joint replacement, the correct alignment and size of the implants are of utmost importance.
The effects of individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are illustrated.
Within the framework of the Erlangen Glaucoma Study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has proven to be suitable for separating securely diseased patients from confirmed controls.
In a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the pre-hospital initial care of 274 acutely injured (58%) or ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 was examined with regard to the timing of operations, compliance with the response time, age and gender distribution, severity levels, causes of trauma and injury patterns, the type of acute pediatric illness, pre-hospital emergency diagnostics and therapy, as well as the means of transport and the destination hospital, based on emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopedic University Hospital Mainz has been investigating which medical conditions can be effectively treated with low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
The composition of bone marrow changes with increasing age, but also during pathological processes.
In the context of this study, age- and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in subjects as a basis for interpreting patient examinations in diseases of the hematopoietic system.
Currently, therapy control is not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion status due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without an actual tendency for recurrence are sometimes unnecessarily subjected to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus exposed to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A prerequisite for P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
A P-wave triggering must be performed, and the P-wave filtering must be done bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
A standardization of the method is urgently desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation show a significant difference in P-wave duration compared to patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol, as a class III antiarrhythmic, does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In summary, the signal averaging of the P-wave after optimization of the method allows the identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
A prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is the knowledge of pain genesis.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are conducted through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to the chronicity of such pain.
The therapy for nociceptive and neuropathic pain is illustrated using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics are particularly important for chronic pain management.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapy standards must be observed.
Using local anesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain blockades is now obsolete.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic nerve blocks play a special role in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiating the pelvic lymphatic pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific questions are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of the para-aortic lymphatic drainage pathways does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival compared to the sole irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies using outdated radiation technology.
Radiation therapy for the lymphatic pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard treatment but an individual decision and should be carried out within the framework of studies (e.g., ARO 95-3).
Due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows for a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis and its special forms are presented, and in particular, the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively managed with a thin-caliber drainage.
In contrast, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated for a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinical presentation, e.g. in ventilated patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnostics.
A hemothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with a Bülau drainage to prevent the risk of severe blood loss and, if necessary, receive surgical care.
A spontaneous hemothorax also requires drainage and internal medical clarification.
The doctor in an internal medicine intensive care unit must master the diagnosis and treatment of pneumo- and hemothorax.
The research question of this prospective single-case observational study with 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information to the clinical findings, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology, and radiology.
Similarly, the lethality, overall injury severity, the likelihood of bleeding complications, and the proportion of accompanying pelvic injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e., pelvic injuries with accompanying peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip), represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions are the main focus of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabulum fractures, as joint fractures, pose a particular challenge.
The surgical treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation shows the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome worsens.
The primary trauma-related cartilage damage appears to have a significant influence on the long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
An isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms similar to aortic isthmus stenosis in a 56-year-old patient.
Remarkable in the case described here is both the atypical and isolated location of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of the calcifications.
The initial findings from angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested a differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection, or a past aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalyzing outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids through choroidal perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs through specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of this receptor type in the RPE were investigated.
In recent times, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has been questioned in reference to the changes in educational and social structures.
In the discourse on the application and developments of reproductive techniques, the experiential aspects of those affected recede into the background.
Help outside of medical treatment is often only sought by many at a point when they are exhausted or very disappointed by unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastasis locations for metastasizing breast, prostate, and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy methods depends on the histology, detection of extraskeletal metastases, and the general condition of the patient.
For receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the first-line treatment.
In receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or detection of liver metastases, chemotherapy is indicated.
For small cell bronchial carcinomas, chemotherapy should generally be performed.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are accessible to radioiodine therapy.
In cases of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is generally more cautious and is primarily limited to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in the imaging detection of bone metastases response to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for determining bone breakdown products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve stretching pain should be investigated.
The risk of occupational HIV infection is often subjectively perceived as high.
This view overlooks the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Thus, Hepatitis B has become the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral infections is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccinations, for example, there is a clear recommendation for Hepatitis B vaccination for hospital staff.
In case of injuries involving HBV-contaminated material, a combined active and passive vaccination is performed post-exposure.
There is no medication-based post-exposure prophylaxis for Hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon upon detection of HCV-RNA appears to have a high success rate.
In a 26-year-old woman, lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed in preparations of a videothoracoscopically obtained lung biopsy.
The pulmonary changes led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as an angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive reactions in both the muscularly differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation, up to 5 cm in diameter, in the left frontal brain.
Polytope organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidney, lung, and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international debate on issues of euthanasia, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to prefer physician-assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the assisted suicide of a psychiatrist in 1994 gives reason to examine this issue from a psychiatric perspective.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) were histochemically and immunohistochemically investigated in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate specimens.
A differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, stroma, and vessels was demonstrated both by the NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemically.
In the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there appears to be a pronounced reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has been carried out yet due to the small number of preparations.
In the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of NOS depending on the vessel segment could also be detected using the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional blood flow, and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse ileus causes, the indication for surgery and the choice of operative procedure for small bowel obstruction are difficult to standardize.
A uniform approach to intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of an intestinal splint) and abdominal wall closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small intestine plication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with the Noble operation largely being replaced by the Child-Phillips plication and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no confirmed indications or contraindications for either plications, long probes, or other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socio-economic significance of small bowel ileus, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved through reproductive medicine and their public discussion can allow for an increase in their societal acceptance as a safe and successful treatment method while simultaneously preventing misunderstandings.
Furthermore, such an analysis provides a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the affected couples.
Gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength of depressed individuals have often been described in clinical literature, but have rarely been empirically investigated.
We recorded various gait and force parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework, which is essentially based on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressive individuals were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which capture stride length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed, and 3-minute walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement of symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third therapy week were mainly observed in knee and elbow extension, as well as in all examined gait parameters.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the context of this pilot study are suitable for reliable and low-stress examination of relationships between depression and motor skills and can thus be used in more extensive studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
In this case, an acute glaucoma attack in the form of a cilio-lenticular block may occur or chronic glaucoma may be present.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely leads to pressure regulation.
We report on the results after cataract surgery for lens subluxation and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenic training (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
In comparison to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS-Patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
The VIP plasma concentrations, apart from occasional deviations, showed no significant differences compared to the normal values (x +/- s:
PS-Patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurological deterioration, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex, and storage phenomena in lymphocytes up to the ages of 3.2 and 4 years old.
The -L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was significantly reduced (<3% of the normal value).
So far, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who was admitted to the hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
In the cerebrospinal fluid, coagulase-negative staphylococci and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein were detected.
The thrombus had to be removed through cardiothoracic surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this routinely performed test, the autopsy of three individuals who clearly died from freezing or hypothermia showed strongly positive results for ketones without an increase in glucose in the urine.
Using headspace gas chromatography, elevated acetone concentrations of 140, 1004, and 2703 mg/L were detected in all three urine samples.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 with normal glucose levels in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid in detecting death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study of 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide guidance for therapeutic approaches.
The infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, eruptive, symmetrical papules and papulovesicles appeared on the extremities.
The virus serology indicated a recent primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, while the serology for hepatitis B virus was negative.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders, and changes in the muscular balance of the chewing muscles.
The existing classifications primarily focus on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces, such as dislocation, subluxation, and disc dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
In a series of neurological diseases, temporomandibular joint dislocations have been described as a complication.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered from recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis, and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Fire marks can lead to significant psychosocial stress.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, quality of life, and body experience of patients with port-wine stains and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A test psychological examination was conducted on 70 patients with port-wine stains as part of the therapy with the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser, focusing on the areas of disease management, quality of life, and body experience.
The clinical objective was the degree of lightening of the birthmark during the course of treatment.
Patients with birthmarks showed comparably high levels of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the birthmark.
Regarding helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, patients with birthmarks were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
The experience of the body is differentially influenced by the coping with illness.
Since the lightening during laser therapy significantly correlates with reduced psychosocial stress, the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser therapy for port-wine stains can also be considered effective in terms of psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents a distinct clinical entity, as its biological behavior, prognosis, and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas exhibit a variety of pathohistological appearances and a wide spectrum in imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man has had a sebaceous nevus on the right temple area since birth.
During the histopathological examination, 2 adnexal neoplasms associated with the lesion were observed:
A syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction traditionally relies on medical history (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q-waves, newly developed left bundle branch block), and elevated levels of the "classic heart enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the main causes of reversible dementia.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years old.
At present, the differentiation between a primary degenerative dementia with concurrent hypothyroidism and a secondary dementia caused by hypothyroidism is less determined by the psychopathological cross-sectional image than by the course of therapy for the disease.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and renal artery stenosis, a proximal aneurysm of the left subclavian artery was successfully treated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENT©-Peripheral Stent-Graft.
The one-year follow-up observation showed a very good long-term result with freely perfused stent lumen and completely eliminated aneurysm.
In a control computed tomography scan, a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac was found.
In the intravascular ultrasound, there was no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described as a separate entity by Brunsting, Goeckermann, and O'Leary in 1930.
Nevertheless, in the first half of the 19th century, there are already illustrations in an atlas by Marie Nicolas Devergie that almost inevitably suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergies' "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains not only case studies of various forms of syphilitic skin afflictions but also individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy used at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this excessive therapy with mercury, as they healed spontaneously after it was discontinued.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of pyoderma gangrenosum can be found more than 100 years before its first naming.
However, the etiology of this disease pattern has not been sufficiently clarified to date.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial origin of pyoderma gangrenosum persisted in several publications well into the 60s of our century.
Quick awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria for anesthesia for outpatient procedures.
The present study examines the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions after a TIVA with Remifentanil/Propofol (P/R) occurs more rapidly than after a balanced anesthesia with Sevoflurane/Fentanyl (S/F).
Uniform estradiol concentrations are achieved, similar to those in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher compared to TTS treatment in order to achieve effective, yet highly fluctuating drug levels with supraphysiological peak values and subnormal lows.
The high doses of estrogen in oral administration are necessary because there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism during liver passage.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis?
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital heart defect, small intestine atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, and psychomotor retardation, who has a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The measurement of physical capacity in patients with cystic fibrosis and the detection of stress-related changes in oxygen saturation were the objectives of the present study.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or tumors of the urinary bladder was to better reflect the biology of the various lesions and to make a clearer distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The significance for diagnostics and clinical practice in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically examined.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasias, atypias (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasias, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to establish correlations between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation in patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by an intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
One then speaks of a sympathetically maintained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component include complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes, and acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality for individuals with chronic sleep and back problems.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphasic abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In cases of unclear spiral CT findings regarding intravenous tumor extension, contrast-enhanced MRI can represent a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindications for non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated (not yet dialysis-dependent) renal insufficiency, and patients with symptomatic polycystic kidney degeneration.
The conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multi-slice) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common eye injuries in childhood include chemical burns, thermal burns, eyelid injuries, corneal erosion, corneal foreign bodies, eye contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injuries, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is approximately 12 per 100,000 inhabitants/year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for eye injuries in childhood include age (<5 years), gender (male > female), and parental supervision.
The prognosis for visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced not only by rapid and adequate therapy but also by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or eye patching for amblyopia prevention).
In this context, deficits and imbalances in the spine-stabilizing muscles are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back pain.
Therefore, the preservation and restoration of the full performance capacity of the spine-stabilizing muscles, along with the training of coordinative skills and learning spine-friendly behavior, must be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation.
In addition to various pain management measures, physiotherapy treatment techniques including neurophysiological-based methods, physical-balneological measures, and supplementary behavioral training, medical exercise therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
The medical exercise therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practical training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In its phase structure, various therapy goals are presented, particularly the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation progress.
Indication and monitoring of medical exercise therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concepts are adapted in collaboration between physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The indication for surgery in cases of vertebral slippage is based on pain, progressive slippage, and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, however, the deformity remains and in cases of spondyloptosis, a plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass can occur with further progression of the sliding.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now possible to reposition severe sliding processes and restore a normal spinal and trunk shape with an acceptable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims for the anatomical repositioning of the slipped vertebra in every case.
Depending on the extent of the sliding, repositioning and stabilization should be carried out in 1, 2, or 3 surgical steps.
A sole dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
For Grade II and above, the combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, which this article reports on selected results, is to examine the effects of a Gerontopsychiatric Center (GZ:
A combination of outpatient services, day clinics, and elderly counseling is being subjected to an empirical examination for the first time, based on the transformation process from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical outpatient, i.e., home-based) regional care structures, as demanded and extensively justified by the expert commission of the federal government.
Based on extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, a comparison of the supply region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ) is used to analyze changes in the regional supply substructures of gerontopsychiatry (Subsystem A), general medicine (Subsystem B), and elderly care (Subsystem C).
The investigation reveals that, with regard to subsystem A, a GZ has a significant influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care without selecting its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the elderly care system (Subsystem C) may be expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh supply region, the nursing home admission rate after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on her right arm with systemic symptoms (fever, leukocytosis) and significant movement restriction in the right shoulder joint.
Sonographically and computer tomographically, in addition to edema of the skin and adipose tissue, extensive fluid collections were detected around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstices, and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, the skin lesions healed quickly, and in the further course, the mobility in the shoulder joint was also restored.
In the described case, the involvement of joint-related structures in eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated for the first time using modern imaging techniques.
The neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide allows for breast-conserving treatment in larger tumors that are not primarily suitable for breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be monitored with mammography, ultrasound, or MRI.
The advantages of mammography include its good reproducibility and availability.
Mammographically indistinguishable tumors can usually be visualized sonographically.
In MRI, the tumor extension is displayed independently of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It also allows for the recording of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, as microscopically small invasive and especially non-invasive tumor remnants are difficult to detect.
These do not regress even when the invasive tumor regresses and typically indicate intraductal, non-invasive tumor residues.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia, and pronounced autonomic disturbances.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
The present report discusses the treatment of a severe case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in the intensive care unit, using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS), a variant of GBS.
Stent implantation without pre-dilation appears to be able to immediately apply and prevent an emerging dissection in morphologically suitable stenoses.
Neurosurgical treatment methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a dual-track functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei, making them potential target sites for neurosurgical procedures.
His pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Successful experimental lesions of these nuclei have been tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - Currently, both lesioning and restorative and stimulative procedures are used in the clinic.
The previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to improved neuro-radiological and -physiological target location.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia, and drug-induced dyskinesias, while the latter method has proven effective for the treatment of tremors.
Only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a new sprouting of dopaminergic neurons and an increased striatal dopamine release documented;
However, the procedure raises ethical and immunological issues.
The high-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest method and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremors;
In the animal experimental approach, xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells are considered.
Long-term comparative studies between the individual methods are necessary to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol-related disease, in addition to more common conditions such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal seizures, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis, and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic lateralized sharp potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted with the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis after experiencing several secondary generalized focal seizures on the right side of the body.
The laboratory tests showed elevated levels of Gamma-GT and MCV.
In the CCT and cerebral MRI, a microangiopathy and brain atrophy were observed.
Despite intravenous treatment with Acyclovir and Vitamin B1 and a triple anticonvulsive therapy, epileptic seizures and a deterioration of the general condition were still observed.
Multiple EEG examinations revealed periodic steep left parieto-occipital emphasized waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died from pneumonia.
The described clinical picture corresponds to the criteria of the SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinomas in children and adolescents without association with a basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus, or following radiotherapy are very rare (so far 86 cases in world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation in keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage have not yet been conducted in these patients.
A report about a 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma in the right infraorbital region.
Neither the medical history nor the clinical examination provided any indications of a genetic predisposition to the development of basal cell carcinoma.
In a study of 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses were performed using pelvic crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to investigate the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Based on the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursor cells, and fiber density were calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts in terms of the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was observed in approximately 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
In a similar manner, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic precursor cells, which can be related to the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, hemoglobin synthesis, and the degradation of expelled normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residues-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 30% of biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis and clinical parameters such as hemoglobin levels, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood, and spleen size were calculated.
These variables obviously indicate more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification into three different histological subgroups was made:
This simplified histological classification was to be assigned corresponding hematological data.
Sequence biopsies on 173 patients who received monotherapy with IFN, Hydroxyurea (HU), or Busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment were best illustrated by calculating indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of individual variables in the repeated samplings and the associated temporal differences.
In patients with complete hematological remission after IFN administration, the regeneration of erythropoiesis was observed along with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages, including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups showed a transition from both a (non-fibrous) granulocytic and megakaryocytic subtype to a myelofibrotic group in approximately 40% of patients in ongoing studies.
This phenomenon was in contrast to a quantitative reduction of the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients under HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
In summary, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods in order to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease progression.
125 consecutive patients admitted to a medical-geriatric department were to be diagnosed with a naturalistic design regarding mental disorders.
Based on the clinical examination and the values in the Mini-Mental State Examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as not examinable.
The remaining 74 patients were clinically assessed and screened using scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia-related developments were possibly proven or ruled out through neuropsychological testing.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of clinical significance (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, and in more than half of them, the disorder was relevant to the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains unclear how the necessary treatment for the psychological disorder, which is required for every 5th to 6th patient after this result, can be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
The inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
The conventional imaging diagnosis of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low in this case.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is capable of detecting both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method include examiner dependency, lack of standardization so far, and the still relatively high costs.
Therefore, the "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatism Center Berlin", which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists, and orthopedists, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are explained and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
The Hyperimmunoglobulin E Syndrome (Job's Syndrome, Hiob Syndrome, Buckley Syndrome) is a rare immune system disorder that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The disease is characterized by recurrent urticarial rashes, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs, and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically indicative are significantly increased IgE concentrations in the serum while simultaneously lacking evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases.
A treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerable and effective therapeutically.
More than a year after the one-time therapy, the symptoms have continued to improve.
The current state of knowledge and available therapy options for Hyper-IgE Syndrome are presented and discussed.
In Hyper-IgE Syndrome, a therapy attempt with IVIG should be considered a first-choice option.
The present study presents the results of laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after the surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
Over 98% of all patients rate the success of the surgery as very good or good and would undergo a new anti-reflux operation if necessary.
Persistent, but not affecting the quality of life, side effects of the operation were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required a renewed medication-based anti-reflux therapy.
A laparoscopic refundoplication was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease using laparoscopic "floppy-Nissen" fundoplication can be documented and demonstrated not only through objective findings but also through the subjective assessment of the patient and the measurement of quality of life data.
The clinical symptomatology with neuroglycopenia is groundbreaking, and the inappropriately high insulin and C-peptide secretion during hypoglycemia in the fasting test is conclusive.
The standard procedure is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, the resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia is problematic, as they are associated with a high recurrence rate.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appear to be superior to selective tumor removal.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization, and systemic chemotherapy are options.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under Section 216 of the German Penal Code (StGB);
From a medical perspective, it is also ethically unjustifiable.
This does not change the various tendencies to decriminalize "killing on demand" under certain conditions in Germany, as in the Netherlands.
Nutrient components as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be conceptually distinguished from immunologically active cells of the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the primary oxidative energy substrate for enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthesis nitrogen.
The importance of glutamine becomes especially evident in critically ill patients.
The amino acids arginine and ornithin are mainly important as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are broken down into mainly short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate, and butyrate by bacterial fermentation in the lower intestinal sections.
These, among other things, exert a trophic effect on the colon mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the non-nutrient substances, it is mainly the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon, as well as various growth factors, that contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental well-being.
By using a diary as a measurement instrument, individual evaluations of situational influencing factors in care and stress-promoting factors in the nursing process could be identified on the one hand, and on the other hand.
The results show both large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their effects on physical and mental well-being.
Talus fractures are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the ankle area.
Early diagnosis allows for differentiated treatment options and significantly influences long-term outcomes.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for definitive diagnosis and determining the appropriate course of treatment.
Dislocated fractures, when treated conservatively as described in the literature and based on personal experience, lead to pain and limited mobility, ultimately resulting in long-term arthrotic remodeling of the subtalar joint.
In the indication for a surgical approach, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically reattached to allow for a consequence-free healing.
Comminuted fractures and small displaced fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be assessed due to potentially altered joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unclear, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
An increase in dermal mast cells and upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in uninvolved skin, as well as increased P-selectin in the serum, indicating a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammation system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in indolent mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to popular belief, acute urticaria is rarely caused by IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, pseudo-allergies to food (73%) usually play a role, and less frequently chronic inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract (11%), with long-lasting remissions when avoiding (diet) or eliminating the triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are primarily considered secondary and not disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, usually associated with life-threatening injury patterns in the context of multiple traumas.
The 3 case reports are intended to illustrate the variability of possible injuries along with scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures for this relatively rare injury, which is usually only treated in trauma centers, are described.
The 3 cases are presented in the chronological sequence of polytrauma management, as well as pointing out the differentiated possibilities of care.
Reports from previous working groups within the framework of multicenter studies with only a small patient collective show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to the management together with the mostly polytraumatized and correspondingly vitally threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-Cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
The postoperative course of 74 out of these 78 patients is known for a period of 2 months to 35.2 years (median 3.6 years;
A weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found in higher T-stages, there were increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In the statistical analysis, the e-Cadherin expression (<= 20%/> 20%), synchronous distant metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1), and the radicality of the procedure (R0/R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-Cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps, and rubella are becoming increasingly dangerous for adults due to the shift in the age peak.
With the MMR combination vaccine, an effective method is available for the prevention of this disease and its sequelae.
Through the 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination, measles and mumps can be eliminated and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development (ILSE) is to determine indicators for healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.
In a regional comparison, differences in personality were shown in the areas of neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region were found for openness and in some subtests of cognitive measurement, as well as in the doctor's judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ in over 80% of cases and mostly occur after abdominal surgical procedures.
They are classified in terms of anatomy into intraperitoneal, visceral, and abscesses affecting the anterior retroperitoneal space.
Today, sonographically or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approximately 80% when used for defined indications.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventionally, while pancreatic, spleen and Crohn's abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amoebiasis) are diagnosed late due to their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities.
Since the mid to late 80s, various research groups have been trying to improve the prediction of preterm birth in cases of prematurity through immunological diagnostics - particularly through cytokine detection.
However, the disadvantage is that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been convincing from the amniotic fluid, i.e. through amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high variability of individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Possibly, the cytokine detection in the cervix of the pregnant woman conducted using PCR technique is a viable path for the future.
The load on the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and during lateral flexion while standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured while sitting than while standing.
Therefore, there is little reason not to allow patients, whose spine has been mono- or bisegmentally stabilized, to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
The load on the bisegmental implants was often significantly changed by the additional ventral stabilization with bone chips.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often significantly higher after ventral stabilization than before.
The implant load was not reduced by a corset or girdle.
Therefore, it is not necessary to provide patients with a corset after a mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningioma was added to the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to designate meningiomas with a higher tendency to recur compared to usual meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for the anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be associated with certain uncertainties.
We have searched for further prognostically relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined nuclear area-related Ki-67-(MIB1-)Index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 grades (N=160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the "recurrence"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a poorly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Optionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, in 50% of cases showed a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-).
Through histochemical analysis, we have demonstrated that in meningiomas, the tissue-nonspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is located on 1p, can be used as a marker enzyme associated with progression and recurrence (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in clinical practice and can lead to misinterpretations in the context of tumor grading, we suggest the term intermediate type meningiomas for this group of tumors, which is relatively prone to recurrence and is located between the usual and anaplastic meningiomas.
Joint process fractures occupy a special position within mandibular fractures due to the particular anatomical situation.
Computer tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment exists for severely displaced or dislocated fractures.
The preauricular, sub or perimandibular, retromandibular, and oral approaches are established as operative access points.
For the fixation of the fragments, only functionally stable methods such as the mini plate or tension screw should be used.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with suspected focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas, as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing Fowler's solution;
In addition, a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was diagnosed as a secondary finding.
Background and research question.
Despite the significant prevalence of dermatoses in Sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely underrepresented in the basic health services established there.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care system should be examined in relation to the prevalence of skin diseases.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term results after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single primary care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL allows for a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences, and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasias, port-wine stains, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
The breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, identify risk factors regarding the occurrence, and evaluate the benefits of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease during an acute flare-up.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic disease courses are often barely manageable.
Additionally, throughout the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur.
We report on 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which were hardly controllable even with the administration of high doses of Prednisolone and Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine.
Both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to the immunosuppression that was carried out.
In both cases, the originally high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) could be tapered to a minimal maintenance therapy.
After every 9 cycles of therapy, the patients remained symptom-free during a follow-up period of 1 year under a minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with Prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-aged children complain of recurring abdominal pain, making it one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very patchy in many areas.
The long-wave UV A-light (340-450 nm, Max.) emitted by a Wood's lamp.
365 nm) is primarily used in the diagnosis of dermatoses, which are associated with a typical fluorescence (Tinea capitis, Erythrasma, Tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood's light has been used with the addition of fluorescence markers in the application control of topicals.
During the induction of hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms within the framework of programmed ventricular stimulation, endocardial mapping is possible.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circuit excitation through stimulation maneuvers ("Entrainment-Mapping") and analysis of the "Post-Pacing" interval.
In clinical cases and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardias, an acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases through high-frequency current catheter ablation.
The success rate is significantly lower for multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In approximately 20-30% of cases, a recurrence must be expected.
In cases of incessant chamber tachycardias and frequent ventricular tachycardias after the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardias is a therapy method complementary to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future through new mapping and ablation techniques.
From January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively examined in 386 patients with a rectal carcinoma in UICC stage I-III after conventional surgical procedures and R0 resection of the tumor.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, and consequently a significant increase in the UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and the pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stage I and II.
In the overall patient sample and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in local recurrence rate in UICC stage I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but rather to a stage shift within the framework of more precise tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically modifiable factors, particularly the total mesorectal excision for the development of a locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, there are currently no uniform standards for documenting findings.
However, these standards are necessary to enable comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of results, so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains the most common infectious disease leading to death worldwide.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing poverty, and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, particularly due to the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), also known as scarring pemphigoid, is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests on the skin and mucous membranes.
About 70% of patients have eye involvement.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The discovery of these abscesses using echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Just like other diseases, asymptomatic courses are also known in endocarditis (18, 19, 20, 21), but clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about Interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its first description is increasingly touching on areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 stands out particularly in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear as an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in the fight against melanoma.
A preliminary pilot study using IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to significantly influence the presence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
This overview aims to outline the molecular, immunological, and preclinical properties, as well as potential applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
The study examined whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (Gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors, and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow for an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, the first part outlines six research trends relevant to everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative concept of everyday competence is presented, which interlinks aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A series of experimental investigations and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractionated radiation therapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
By specifically inhibiting the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment, significant progress could potentially be achieved in radio-oncology.
In a brief overview, the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibiting the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during radiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways, or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only currently proven method is the implementation of radiation therapy in the shortest possible overall treatment time, e.g. through accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis as well as the diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within an hour of admission and at intervals of 4-24h in relation to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were observed up to 6 weeks after discharge with regard to the primary endpoint of death or recurrent acute coronary syndrome. Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge, compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression regarding the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24h), age, gender, and diagnosis revealed an independent influence of TnT (Cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, Odds Ratio=7.5) and CRP (Cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, Odds Ratio=5.3).
The sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of AMI were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour, and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24 hour course. Conclusions:
Highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little help for acute infarction diagnostics, alongside Troponin T.
The assessment of the patient's prognosis through TnT is significantly independently supplemented and thus significantly improved by CRP 4-24h after admission.
A 5 and a half year old girl with an optic glioma and resulting internal hydrocephalus developed progressive ascites 7 months after the implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disruption of the blood-brain barrier was found to be the cause of the increased cerebrospinal fluid protein through cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis.
The ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, in cases of liver damage with portal hypertension, there is an increased risk of recurrent, acute, and transfusion-requiring conduit bleeding.
While the diagnosis is simple, various treatment options are available.
Most often, the source of bleeding is in varicose-like dilated vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxysclerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel is an option.
The resection of the varicose vein-carrying conduit portion is an option in life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be localized.
In cases of frequent recurrent bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as a cause for any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the genetically best characterized solid tumors:
A number of species-specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known, which are associated with clinical parameters such as the tendency for recurrence of meningiomas or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression typical for gliomas, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms among tumor cells, which are also influenced by iatrogenic factors such as radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnea due to a thrombosis of a mitral valve prosthesis.
The patient had undergone a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) due to a grade III mitral stenosis six years earlier.
Three years later, a valve thrombosis occurred, necessitating a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
In the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly better understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial tissue due to loss of cell-cell adhesion, the invasion of the extracellular matrix through proteolysis, and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumor cells is facilitated by angiogenic factors, which can lead to a degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
The adhesion to endothelial cells, the exit from the vascular system, and the induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastasis process.
Furthermore, a tumor cell will only survive upon entering the circulation if it evades the immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum, and pituitary gland, and rarely in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene has been assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is believed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes, whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum, and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 most often manifests between the ages of 20 and 35, primarily through hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have dealt with the reduction of endothelial cell density after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods of the donor tissue.
The main issue here was usually the interpretation of the results, as despite the long-known dynamic cell loss, very variable follow-up intervals were combined.
The aim of this study was to conduct a long-term endothelial examination at the same dates, taking into account two different preservation techniques.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have varying levels of perioperative thromboembolic risk, which requires the continuation of prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation (PTT, prothrombin time, thrombin time).
For elective procedures, the administration of coumarin is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively, in emergency procedures there is a need for a Vitamin K or Fresh Frozen Plasma substitution.
Operations on patients undergoing heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less problematic, as the effect of heparin subsides within a few hours of discontinuation.
There are results from various epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in Germany.
When transferring the prevalence rates from younger epidemiological studies to the entire population of Germany, estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients are obtained.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems with patient identification, the epidemiological area, and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded through a representative survey among doctor groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of opportunity to clarify the diagnosis.
The projection and subsequent consolidation of the survey results from the individual doctor groups resulted in an estimated number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of that by Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "questionable MS" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
The study examined how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant findings can be identified.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce increased growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be considered a promising new technique in in situ tissue engineering, with its clinical application expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by their general practitioner.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of paramount importance for diagnosis and therapy.
While in the 70s the doctor's conversational style was considered a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversation suggest understanding the doctor's conversational behavior as an interactive process in which both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior with each other.
Training programs aimed at improving basic psychosomatic competence in general practitioners often show only limited success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of the Düsseldorf training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
The continuing education concept as well as experiences with it will be presented and discussed in conclusion.
Data for the prognosis of heart failure has so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All these sources are only limitedly applicable to everyday clinical practice.
The programming of the speech processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in small children, specifically the determination of the stimulation strength that corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation should be avoided at all costs, as it can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively recorded stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds, which were triggered via the CI, and the MAL and hearing threshold values determined during the postoperative speech processor setting in 27 carriers of three different types of implants.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold is a practical, objective tool for simplifying, refining, and accelerating speech processor programming.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the average MAL was calculated as a percentile of the average ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated based on the intraoperatively recorded stapedius reflex thresholds showed in some cases large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometry.
Therefore, a safe and simple mathematical determination of the MAL and hearing threshold based on the intraoperative SR threshold was not possible.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold can contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be tested, in addition to an intraoperative function check.
However, the exact determination of the MAL will have to be made by another, preliminary behavioral audiometric method.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swellings in the red parts of a multicolored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was observed, which could be distinguished from a real lymphoma through electron microscopic, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may possibly be a result of a dermal-allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the field of kidney using fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, over the course of 8 years, an extra mammary gland the size of a chicken egg developed in the left anterior axillary line, protruding the skin without any buds or areolas.
An early diagnosis and correct excision are desired.
In the context of endoprosthetic surgeries, damage can occur to the arterial vessels adjacent to the joint.
Through 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked progression of possible complications as well as the applied therapy are described.
Before and after endoprosthetic surgeries, a vascular status of the extremities should be assessed.
Delusion is understood as intersubjectively strange beliefs with a tendency towards subjective certainty, which, as the subject of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder, lose their strange character.
Imaginations from which delusion arises are dynamically charged according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to actualize, which weighs heavily on the imaginations and is heightened in psychotic conditions, is a prerequisite for delusion.
Additionally, the failure of deactualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure must be considered.
Through a case study, considerations that start from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronicity.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor, first described in the lung.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing obstruction due to a thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was observed in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed based on an overview of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice consists of a complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore introduce examination possibilities of finger and fingertip arteries in healthy subjects using color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we used.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible for all examined subjects (n=10).
It is exemplarily shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this magnitude can be detected with the method - given appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the necessity of reimplanting a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with battery exhaustion of the pulse generator and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the functional duration of the initially implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new specialized instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems, allows the performance of mitral valve surgeries through a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but non-metastasizing tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a causal role.
Preferred locations are the trunk and the parts of the extremities close to the trunk.
By combining various imaging techniques, not only can the size and extent of the tumor be determined, but the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few.
In previous years, surgical resection held a monopoly position, but adjuvant therapies such as radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy are increasingly being given more importance.
Mutilating procedures and procedures with subsequent functional losses are only justified in the event of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept for atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
An exacerbation can often be successfully countered phototherapeutically, especially through UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapies such as glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine or azathioprine can usually be avoided in the treatment of atopic eczema, or only represents a therapeutic alternative in a few exceptional cases.
The present case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with watery nasal discharge, recurrent nosebleeds, and slowly progressive, left-sided nasal obstruction in the ENT department of the BwK Ulm for clarification.
The clinical examination and the CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently originated from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was completely resected via a midfacial degloving.
The histological examination resulted in the diagnosis of a neurinoma.
Based on this case study and a review of the literature, the diagnosis and treatment of this rare nasal tumor is presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversially evaluated treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical treatment methods for lumbar disc prolapse, but they can sometimes lead to significant impairments.
The most severe complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhages, and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account when indicating chemonucleolysis and when informing the patients.
Six patients with eosinophilic granuloma of the face, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
The Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy represents an effective and minimally invasive treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapeutic alternative to systemic treatment with Dapsone.
Based on the questions of need, utilization, and effectiveness of psychosomatic consultative/liaison services, the effectiveness of a psychosomatic-dermatological consultative activity was examined in more detail for the first time in the present study.
The extent of compliance with treatment recommendations was recorded and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as frequency of conversations, preconceptions, and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was examined.
Two years after the consultation, follow-up questionnaires were sent for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of a total of n=69 patients with a recommended course of action, a compliance rate of 78.3% was found, with a rate of 69% for the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation.
No significant correlation was found with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of conversations have any influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was conducted.
A positive predisposition towards consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had a compliance-promoting effect.
Overall, a high level of effectiveness was achieved with relatively little time and effort.
A report is given about a 29-year-old patient with an unusual facial pigmentation mark.
From a clinical aspect, the pigmented lesion corresponded to a Naevus spilus, in the histological diagnosis the existence of multiple blue naevi could be confirmed, in addition there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed an expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus proves to be the unusual combination of a Lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and a dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often need far more fluid intraoperatively than can be expected from preoperative fasting, intraoperative fluid losses, and ventilation.
Changes in Starling forces - particularly vascular permeability - may play a role here, although these have not yet been closely examined.
The discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, especially about operation-related complications, such as the so-called post-discectomy syndrome, has in the past led to the search and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc fenestration, or chemonucleolysis.
The mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, the automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures, and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 70s.
The results in patient treatment vary from approximately 30% good and very good to nearly 100% good and very good results depending on the author and study.
It is noteworthy that prospective randomized studies, which have comparison groups - whether conservatively or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here, the results of intradiscal treatment methods are often assessed more critically and with lower success rates than the sometimes retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers, but cannot withstand rigorous scientific criteria of study design well.
Overall, it can be concluded that percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a subset of lumbar disc disease, as a limited indication is necessary for successful therapy.
At the present time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
The present review compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuetTM (DU) in their significance when applied after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC, and DU are 88%, 91%, 90%, and 98% to 100% respectively.
The hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems could show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is primarily due to the removal of the sheath immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can lower hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
For the treatment of full-thickness macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and possibly epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy to relieve the macula from the suspected intravitreal traction forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been peeling off the internal limiting membrane (ILM) around the foramen from the retina for some time now.
The clinical results and the ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and primary dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, non-diagnostic initial electrocardiogram, a pre-hospital time of >= 12 hours, or an unknown pre-hospital time.
To describe these patient groups and compare the influence of lysis and primary dilation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
A drug addict who died of fulminant viral hepatitis in hepatic coma 5 days after the onset of initial symptoms.
The serological diagnosis revealed a healed Hepatitis A, a persistent Hepatitis B, a Hepatitis C, and a superinfection with the Delta Virus (Delta Hepatitis only detected post-mortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (over days) into the pulmonary circulation with subsequent extravasation and deposition of fat in alveolar macrophages.
The Tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementia of other causes, and 36 cognitively unimpaired control subjects.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very early stage of the disease (total score in the Mini-Mental-State-Test 25 to 28 points).
In these cases as well, a significant increase in Tau was measured compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in Tau was observed in patients with other types of dementia.
In Alzheimer's patients, no quantitative correlation was found between the increase in Tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit, determined with SPECT.
The results suggest that Tau could also be elevated in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and could serve as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustular dermatitis primarily in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustulations were impressive.
The present study describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a significant problem after reconstructive vascular procedures.
The underlying pathogenic mechanisms are accepted to be the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation, and remodeling processes.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by extending the survival time of intimal cells, resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples from 25 primary and 14 restenosis lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were tested using the TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling).
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with re-stenosis origin than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (average cell densities:
A key finding of this study showed that hypercellular restenosis tissue had fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies here showed a significantly lower proportion of intimal plaque cells, particularly smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
However, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data points to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying form of cell death, with differences between both types of lesions with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenosis.
The present findings suggest that reduced apoptosis represents an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as typically detectable in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas, which can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
A detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas follows on cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The current incidence of microbial (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is estimated at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been steadily increasing for years.
The prognosis significantly depends on a rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy.
In cases of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the usually diagnostic clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the termination of an indiscriminately started antibiotic therapy and review of the blood culture techniques used, or the application of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with a potentially toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg/ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolisms do not contraindicate surgery with a heart-lung machine, provided a primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and the operation is performed early before the development of a post-stroke blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
A significant improvement in prognosis through early surgical intervention has also been demonstrated for disease courses complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially following acute valve insufficiency), the occurrence of acute renal failure, an embolic infection of primary aortic valve vegetations on the anterior mitral leaflet, or a sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be particularly well examined with transvaginal ultrasound, as the large, "cystic" brain ventricles can be relatively easily imaged.
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections, in which one finds either an increased or a decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
With the Infection Protection Act, the system of reportable diseases in Germany is being put on a new basis.
Both certain diseases are reportable in case of suspicion, illness or death (mainly by doctors) as well as the laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by those required to report.
It also determines which of these details may be further transmitted by the health department.
In particular, in the case of suspicion reports or the reporting of pathogen detections, not all mandatory information may be available through the report, therefore the health department must conduct its own investigations in these cases in order to be able to transmit the corresponding information.
The health departments also have the task of consolidating incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
For this, case definitions were developed. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which facilitates the compilation of the information required for transmission to the health department.
The transmission to the RKI then takes place via the state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of cancer cases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, nearly 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
People suffering from cancer usually experience a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions, which, in the absence of adequate treatment, can lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and their relatives.
Although various organizations offer therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site for essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticuloendothelial system, liver diseases lead to laboratory-analytically reduced values of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In cases of compensated haemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic treatment of the haemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxae, clinical bleeding usually occurs with more or less consumption coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like findings, and thromboembolisms only occur in exceptional cases.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after sutureless corneal cataract surgery.
As part of fall prevention, a routine medication review is among the requirements.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over the age of 75, it was investigated how often drugs are prescribed that can increase the risk of falls by potentially causing dizziness.
The amount of bleeding from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults varies up to eightfold between different heart centers.
Excessive bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed individually.
By avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerating low hemoglobin, using autologous blood, and strictly adhering to a transfusion protocol, the use of allogeneic transfusions is reduced.
The perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent field of study at the European level depends on its inclusion in the medical guidelines of the European Union.
The oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with persistent effort and great exertion.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery served as a forum for the discussion of substantive issues among representatives of member states and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to their efforts, maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists, at the end of the 20th century.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, a spread of fungi into the middle ear can lead to serious complications.
In particular, preoperative cleaning of the external ear canal is absolutely necessary.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous Miconazole solution.
Three comparison solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for i.v. infusion, as well as Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), two balanced solutions developed for surgical procedures on the eye, were examined for their possible influence on the postoperative inflammation course after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The average age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As the primary cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% of cases, and survival of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation in 43% of cases.
In 298 patients, a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted, and in 42 patients, an AV-sequential or dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted.
In 25 patients, a subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted, and in 2 patients an epicardial patch system was implanted, in 92 patients the implantation site was abdominal and in 248 it was pectoral.
In the course of treatment, 33 patients (9.7%) experienced a total of 34 probe-related complications.
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications was three times higher at 12% with the dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators than with the single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators at 4% (p = 0.05).
In more than half of the patients (55%), the diagnosis was primarily made based on a routine X-ray examination, in a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain), and in a fifth (21%) based on the electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynovectomy in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, particularly chronic polyarthritis, was examined.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), in electron beam tomography (EBT) no X-ray tube mechanically rotates around the patient, but an electron beam is directed at targets arranged semi-circularly around the patient, where the actual X-ray radiation is then generated.
With this ultra-fast technology, it has become possible to generate axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely map all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution <0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, EKG-triggered cross-sectional images (slice thickness 2-3 mm) during a brief breath-hold allows for the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcification with EBT must be considered the currently most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis, including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are seen under the assumption of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and motion artifacts, as well as overlay of the coronary arteries by veins and pronounced coronary calcifications.
Despite this, the EBT has already made it possible to clinically assess non-invasive images of coronary arteries, which may be further optimized through additional technical advancements.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has been established as the vessel of choice over the last 25 years.
In addition to the established procedure of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging procedure for examining this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a consistent examination result was found in a high proportion of patients compared to angiography.
During the preoperative phase, the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic component corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, while postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flow component.
These non-invasive findings from the transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
Just as in the preoperative comparison, a high degree of agreement is also found postoperatively between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularization result.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should gain increasing importance.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male, hypertensive patients over the age of 60, who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are an extreme rarity.
Here, young patients with or without immediate trauma in their history predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the middle cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The article demonstrates the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of nursing homes and care facilities.
The adjustment is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies, and intensify the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to simply copy supposed ideal models, rather it is the task of the management bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
The report is about a phenotypically female newborn of the 37th week of gestation, who died on the 14th day of life due to kidney failure.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually strong, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis of Drash Syndrome.
Since the end of the 60s, accidents have been one of the most common causes of child morbidity and mortality in Western industrialized nations.
While accidents involving older children and teenagers usually occur in traffic and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents involving infants and toddlers, which predominantly occur during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations among 10,271 infants and toddlers in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
There are reports of 2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts, which had caused long-term lumbalgiform complaints.
In both cases, there was a urinary disorder in the form of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
The imaging magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) can detect the passage of blood enriched with contrast medium through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical application of this method is delayed, on one hand, by the difficulty of image evaluation, and on the other hand, by the fact that with conventional techniques only one layer per heartbeat can be imaged.
New developments in both MRI scanners and strategies for accelerated image capture enable the assessment of perfusion across the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echo planar sequence with preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in a stroke patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood circulation conditions in ligament ruptures represent a significant parameter, particularly with regard to the prospects of success of surgical care, this study aimed to illustrate the vascularization of the inner knee ligament.
The special circulatory situation was examined using microangiography on 21 cadaver specimens.
It was found that the supply came from proximally through 1 or 2 main vessels, which preferably ran in the ventral band parts.
The vessel density decreased from proximal to distal as well as from ventral to dorsal.
Given the reduced vascularization of the distal band parts, we would recommend band reconstruction using fibrin glue here, which allows for atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture-related vascular strangulation.
Annually in Germany, approximately 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease are surgically treated (about 75% of all heart surgeries).
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, primarily the great saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein harvesting techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, yet today, the majority of saphenectomies are performed using a continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open preparation of the great saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up treatment after coronary surgical procedures and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "Bridge" technique) shows desired results, especially a very high patient satisfaction regarding the cosmetic result and the minimal restriction due to the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland Syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal part of the pectoralis major muscle, an ipsilateral symbrachydactyly, and occasionally associated further defects of the thoracic wall, nipple, and breast.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland Syndrome have been described so far.
We report on another patient with this rare combined malformation.
This study aimed to investigate whether early levels of sICAM-1 and sE-Selectin can predict impending sepsis and the severity of sepsis progression.
The range of ophthalmological journals available on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the various magazines and publishers vary greatly in quality and quantity.
Online publications, in contrast to traditional publications, offer many advantages, including low production costs and fast, location-independent and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that online publications will not replace print versions, but will provide a meaningful addition to the existing information offerings.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who suffered a rare form of pure lateral elbow dislocation following a "police grip".
The present case study describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aortoenteric fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after the implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The preoperative diagnosis was made through an upper endoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography scan.
The value of preoperative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical treatment methods, the in-situ reconstruction and the extra-anatomical revascularization, are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Supporters believe that from a certain legal perspective, the Embryo Protection Act would not oppose PGD (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis).
Given this situation, PGD has not yet been carried out in Germany.
The intense discussion that has been ongoing in Germany for some time is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Due to case studies, it was suspected that the muscle-relaxing potency of Atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic abscess.
In a prospective, clinical investigation, this hypothesis should be tested.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unknown origin (FUO) as a disease developing over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C on at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient clarification.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly by hidden abscesses, slow endocarditis, and tuberculosis.
In the present work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
Impressions of the skin are made using a fast-hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measurement area, which correspond to a negative image of the skin.
In the subsequent metrological process, the "roughness" of the skin print is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
Using a statistical program, the measurement data can be analyzed, stored, and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after applying estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary: The distribution ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes to convert serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicentric study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people for whom blood samples are ordered in connection with offenses under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases, the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19. Relative to the mean, the deviation of the quotient in 96% of cases is less than 3%.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the typical constellation is venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure, and consequent right-to-left shunt through an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic disease patterns in children, which change during growth through reinnervation, plexus surgery, and replacement operations, are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible through the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission through the palpation of the wrist pulses, the clinical assessment of vascularity, and through the derivation of the Doppler signal over the wrist arteries.
The emergency operations performed on all 10 children initially involved fragment repositioning and fixation with crossed K-wires through a dorsal approach.
The subsequent assessment of blood circulation revealed a return of pulse in 2 of the 10 children (transient, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
In 8 out of the 10 children, the pulse stopped, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we observed a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In cases of adventitial strangulations (2 of these 5 children), pulse transmission to the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective, strangulating tissue.
In cases of intimate injuries (3 out of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patch plastic.
We observed a combined vessel closure (mechanical-functional closure) in 2 of these 8 children.
During the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses of 9 children could be detected, color duplex sonographically 9 children had a physiological signal, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the brachial artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery.
Ischemic late damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann's contracture) was not detected in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility showed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and a normal, symmetrical pro- and supination.
The supporting joint axis was normal in all children when compared side by side.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to pediatricians, as the pathogen cultivation is successful in only 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available at the earliest after 3-5 days.
The regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose Vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--Tocopherolacetat/d) versus Diclofenac Sodium (3x50mg/d) was tested in inpatient patients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After a three-week treatment, a significant improvement in all examined clinical parameters was observed both under the Vitamin E therapy (n=42) and under the treatment with Diclofenac (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90 minutes to 68 minutes under vitamin E therapy, and from 68 minutes to 30 minutes under diclofenac intake.
The Ritchie Articular Index decreased from 56 to 46 (Vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (Diclofenac).
The grip strength increased in both the Vitamin-E group and the Diclofenac group.
Similarly, a significant reduction in the severity of pain, assessed using a 10cm visual analogue scale, was observed in both groups.
The overall assessment of the therapy's success by both the doctor and the patient was similarly positive for the two medications.
Especially considering the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose Vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be filled with air or even overinflated if a fistula to the esophagus or stomach exists.
Such an observation is depicted in the newborn.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary foregut anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively through an esophageal barium swallow and a Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly fell into severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 or 4.3 mmol/l) within a few weeks due to intoxications with synthetic drugs ("Ecstasy" and "Speed").
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolic condition (initial HbA1c 11.7%), the insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate fluid intake at the onset of the first ketoacidosis.
The clinical picture showed signs of dehydration and tachycardia in addition to peritonitis symptoms;
Disturbances of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and paranoia are essentially attributable to drug intoxication.
The therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte, and insulin replacement.
The processes were uncomplicated.
The report is about a case of ball variance of a Smeloff-Cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation.
Following previous embolic complications, the patient died from cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, grooving and cracking with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in a terminal prosthetic malfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
In the context of a prospective study, 36 patients with osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus were treated on an outpatient basis using arthroscopy and were monitored according to a standardized protocol after 4 and 12 months.
It was found that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the herd were located in the dorsal sections of the talus, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, perforation of the tibia, or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows for a partial synovectomy in the case of accompanying synovitis and the removal of osteophytes on the front edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, short rehabilitation period, and objectively and subjectively good surgical results make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle joint.
Acute heart failure includes decompensated chronic heart failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while the latter requires more in the case of pulmonary edema.
In therapy, in addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used.
Nevertheless, the mortality rate of a cardiogenic shock, which cannot be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 participants, cognitive performance disorders were quantitatively detected after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg Midazolam using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT).
The disturbances partially corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe passage syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, all subjects experienced complete anterograde amnesia with no signs of improvement.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident through the detection of a coarse rotary nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after taking Midazolam.
Presentation of the development status and clinical suitability of solutions using internet technology for image and finding distribution and for video conferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows for a very high-quality representation of the extracranial carotid pathway in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred Time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be displayed without contrast agents.
The application of ultra-fast gradient echo sequences (GES) allows for a first-pass representation of the carotids from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 seconds of measurement time with intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
In the present work, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For an optimally high-quality contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast agent injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively fast blood return from the venous sinus into the jugular veins must be taken into account.
Initially, the optimal time for data acquisition in relation to the presence of contrast medium in the arteries was determined using a model and a computer simulation.
It was shown that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
Through gradual variation of spatial resolution, measurement time, and contrast medium injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on test subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of extracranial carotid artery.
The best qualitative results were achieved with a double-dose technique at an injection speed of 2 ml/s.
The temporal reserves of ultra-fast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further investigations on the optimal KM application at the still very early stage of technology are still pending.
Various pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures serve to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the surgery date until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the precise placement of the drill channels, including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension must be avoided at the time of tibial graft fixation.
Postoperative measures include immediate passive extension of the knee joint, the early start of a movement program, and regular clinical check-ups.
Based on the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided by considering the mentioned measures.
Within the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical therapy options play a crucial role.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring secretion drainage, and the reduction of pain are the main focus.
Conventional, minimally invasive, and endoscopic procedures are used either in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative treatment options.
In many cases, this can prevent unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality, and long hospitalization.
The present work describes and discusses the current surgical and endoscopic techniques for the palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in sick elderly people is one of the most common and least noticed diseases in hospitals, nursing homes, or in home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient group studied, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% is reported.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy needs, such as during acute or chronic illness, to energy deficiency and thus combined with general malnutrition.
For precise diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable a tailored nutritional therapy.
The most common deficiencies in sick elderly people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, causes enormous costs in the healthcare system, and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the elderly population, the problem of malnutrition will intensify.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention, by taking it seriously as an independent disease and integrating it into the curriculum of the training of doctors and nursing staff.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox identifies the ELND along with tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT-category), tumor location, and gender of the tumor carrier as an independent prognostic factor.
In the stratification according to the mentioned prognosis parameters, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, chest, and extremities;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same location as well as with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on arms, legs and lower body (except acral and genitoanal location).
The boundaries of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Driver's license applicants are not only required to have adequate vision, but also the "reliable use" of it in legal terms.
The nystagmus patient strives to achieve this by, for example, adopting a forced head-eye posture or using other compensation mechanisms.
However, according to the current investigation guidelines (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO), these are not allowed for him.
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retained vellus hairs in children and young adults.
The report is about a 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedone-like papules on the face, neck, and chest.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retained keratin, and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent distinct disease entities.
Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that predominantly occurs in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be histologically represented using Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules, some of which were ulcerated.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA, who had multiple cutaneous nodules as well as bone changes.
Under treatment with Erythromycin, all disease symptoms regressed.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column were performed using thoracoscopic technique.
Through increased experience, the operation times were significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients underwent conversion to the open procedure.
Personal experiences confirm the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Key advantages over the open method include reduced access morbidity, reduced need for pain medication, early functional recovery, and a shortened hospital stay.
Operational goal: Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid, intramedullary locking nail in non-drilled technique.
A mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to a narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of the supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for assessing the shape of the acromion in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion shape was compared to the Bigliani classification in the conventional X-ray image.
Under the term primary chronic osteomyelitis, various disease patterns are summarized, which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often caused by bacteria, no pathogen can be detected in the second group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to recur, have a long course and can additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used for tumor exclusion and for obtaining material for bacteriological examination.
There are no histological distinctions between these forms of chronic osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not inherently justified in a demographically aging society, but must prove its societal usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure transformation.
This has led in practice to a corresponding need for professional guidance and triggered the search for a consensus-capable and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social elderly care.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L-chains, an early component of the complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along the preserved elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the stratum papillare, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands, and in the walls of the small vessels in the patient.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extremely exposed in daily use and thus highly susceptible to injuries.
The diverse functions of the hand require not only vitality and sensitivity, but also undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In cases of severe injuries, it is often only possible to regain residual or replacement functions.
The complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage of the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or the essential functions of the hand.
In principle, comprehensive initial care is aimed for.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is the main focus.
The destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed, as far as this is possible.
This is followed by the microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In cases of exposed bones or tendons, the skin covering is replaced by a pedicled or free microsurgical skin flap.
In cases of prolonged ischemia time, this concept is deviated from in that the circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every regained or created function of the hand counts.
Therefore, it is not justifiable to treat such a severe injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local conditions of a specialized department.
The treatment of symptomatic multi-vessel coronary disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible with comparable clinical success and risk, according to the results of 5 large, randomized studies.
However, after PTCA, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long-term course, according to the BARI study, the mortality rate was lower in the operated group of diabetic patients.
The individual therapy recommendation by the treating physician has also proven to be an important factor for the patient's prognosis.
The influence of newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized studies.
A report is given on a 34-year-old patient with the rare disease pattern of Parakeratosis variegata, which occurred 4 years after a Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
To investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes among each other and regarding their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T-cell type, we conducted histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analyses.
While both conditions exhibited characteristic histological changes and a predominantly lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor within both changes could not be confirmed.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without relation to the low malignant Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement about the location of a suspected tumor lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resection margin (R 0 or R 1) must be as precise and unequivocal as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful for breast excisions:
Radiopaque threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
When Sevoflurane comes into contact with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthesia circuit parts, Compound A is formed, which could potentially have a nephrotoxic effect in humans.
Several studies were recently conducted on voluntary participants, which aimed to analyze the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
In total, three studies investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a Sevoflurane concentration of 3 Vol.%, using fresh gas flows of approximately 2 L/min each, on test subjects.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose, and enzymes from the renal tubular cells in the urine of the subjects after Sevoflurane.
The subsequent studies then found either not relevant or even no changes in the renal excretion of these parameters of kidney function.
Another study also examined 3 Vol.% Sevoflurane in subjects, which was administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
Here, no significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
When transferring these results into clinical practice, the experimental nature of the anesthetics used in these studies must be taken into account in every case.
Although the topic of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversially discussed, studies with voluntary subjects, as well as the results of new clinical investigations, suggest that kidney function after surgical procedures under low-flow conditions behaves similarly to that after isoflurane.
So far, in the German-speaking area, there are no published experiences in the therapy of paraphilias (pedophilia, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (Lutein-Releasing-Hormone) agonists.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist Leuprorelin acetate over a period of 12 months.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive actions and according to the patients, there was a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges, and fantasies.
A patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods seem to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of five different intraoperative heat measures.
Baker and his team first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapuls CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins is possible today with almost 100% certainty, both through phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is tied to the high qualification of the examiner.
Both procedures are widely available in Germany.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, however, due to its non-invasiveness, duplex sonography has gained outstanding importance.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography cannot be dispensed with.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two methods is practiced as a "golden partnership" when comprehensive documentation is required.
The chronic rejection reaction is currently the most important unresolved issue in kidney transplantation.
The objective of the present study was to determine whether there is re-endothelialization or re-epithelialization by extrarenal cells after transplantation, or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this backdrop, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in-situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for the human Y and X chromosomes. In a further step, mono- or polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -Actin, Factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in transplant vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular, and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are primarily composed of T-lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Association as a method that shortens the waiting time for the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey was conducted to determine the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all Neurological (272) and Neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision-making aid for determining brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
In response to the question of whether there were false positive findings, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The discussion revealed that the investigators deliberately reported borderline situations, in which the prerequisites were not fully met in some cases.
In none of these cases was an ultrasound examination used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a significant number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid in the diagnosis of brain death, primarily for further confirmation of the diagnosis, less often as a sole method that shortens the waiting time.
The endogenous formation of CO is solely the responsibility of the microsomal heme oxygenase (HO), which exists as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) as well as in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
In the present study, therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme was investigated after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerin leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the stratum corneum lipids into liquid crystalline states.
It particularly improves the hydration of the stratum corneum when used in O/W emulsion to a significant extent, clearly above the effect of urea.
Furthermore, it promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the stratum corneum, thus facilitating the shedding of the stratum corneum.
Especially with long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction attempt can be intensified by glycerin.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerin-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
Glycerin, when used in O/W emulsions, also leads to a protective effect against the action of surfactants and against lipophilic pollutants.
This is likely due to the hygroscopic effect of glycerin, which causes a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerin can lead to an improvement in active ingredient penetration, similar to urea.
Operational goal: Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents through a posterior bone block and capsuloplasty.
Complications of the long-term course, resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts, can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to extended operation times and increased operative trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of the complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Materials and Methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with multi-vessel coronary disease were completely revascularized in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral internal thoracic arteries, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracic artery and radial artery, and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%), the implantation of the two arterial grafts was performed in T-configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
The hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after the removal of the radial artery were not observed, except for temporary paresthesias.
In the angiographic control 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of the coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses >50%.
The complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of multi-vessel coronary disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow for their routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic femoral fractures after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has gained a key position within neuromonitoring, even though the actual metabolic processes in the central neuron cannot be directly and only temporally delayed registered by the brain pressure.
The prerequisite for reliable brain pressure measurement are specific characteristics of brain pressure probes, which are to be investigated in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological perspective in order to gain a better understanding of their different functions and measurement properties.
The partial sphincterectomy is performed by us as part of cataract surgery in the case of a very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is primarily due to a fibrosis ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present study, literature published on the topic of health-related quality of life in children is evaluated in terms of research focus and methods.
The overview shows that empirical studies are so far scarce, the existing measurement tools for children's quality of life are described.
Increased research activities are necessary to be able to use the assessment of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation, and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were identified during the last 5 days before the onset of acute kidney failure and compared with a control group.
Due to skin changes, which based on the available biographical material must be considered as the onset of Rhinophyma, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasion in 1957.
Throughout his entire artistic career, the artist's engagement with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the nasal area, can be demonstrated.
As a founder of Pop Art, Warhol has significantly shaped modern society with his entire body of work, also influencing our expectations of aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the HepaVision program (MEVIS, Bremen), specifically developed for 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and living liver donations.
Experience with the program is so far available for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After the active non-specific immunotherapy has favorably influenced the survival times of melanoma patients both adjuvantly and palliatively, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It includes a gene transfer, which can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, the following are recommended:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells that have been transfected with a cytokine or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro propagated specific T-cells, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of the tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene, whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of distortion tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results has not been precisely estimated so far.
In a study of 309 stationary patients treated with psychotherapy and re-examined a year later, it is shown to what extent raters are influenced by the patients' defensive attitudes on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales, which were measured with validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and Giessen Test:
The tendency to present oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to appear inconspicuously normal.
Their relative improvements (effect size rating scales) decrease to the extent that their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient psychotherapy strengthened the defense in aggravating and reduced it in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequently timely surgical treatment adapted to the severity of the congenital clubfoot, about 25% of recurrences and treatment-required residual deformities are reported.
The main cause appears to be the lack of concentric repositioning and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is a forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual clubfeet (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical approach is presented.
Beyond the 8th to 10th year of life, midfoot osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator, and as a last resort, triple arthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show a pronounced variability in their clinical morphology.
We report on a 77-year-old patient with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-like appearance, we suggest the term "Nevus corymbiformis".
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in transfusion medicine, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine poses a challenge to anesthetists, surgeons, and transfusion physicians.
The combination of various methods, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthesia method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics, and machine autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow us to spare even patients with large intraoperative blood losses the transfusion of allogeneic blood.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), Director of the Kiel Maternity Hospital and the Midwifery Training Institute, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He focused his research and teaching on empirical evidence.
His main work on the narrow pelvis summarizes his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determining the pelvic dimensions and inspecting the Michaelis rhombus named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis of the risks of the birthing process.
Integrity and conscientiousness characterized his research:
He published medical failures with self-criticism, and critically examined new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis's theory on the prevention of puerperal fever.
Out of despair over the many childbirth-related deaths of patients for which he felt partly responsible, he chose to commit suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-known conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can trigger temporary stimulus effects in specific cortical areas in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions, and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experiences, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for application safety are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that usually occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow extratemporally, and are then noticed extracranially as a space-occupying lesion.
The most common symptom is a progressive peripheral facial palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, a progressive hearing impairment on the left, as well as a mild peripheral facial palsy without tear secretion deficit.
The neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The tumor was removed without damaging the motor facial nerve through an extradural "middle fossa approach".
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the N. petrosus major without affection of the motor facial nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) occurs when there is a continuous seizure or multiple seizures, between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still almost exclusively based on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is carried out with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, if unsuccessful, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
The therapy-resistant status epilepticus has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
In this stage of the disease, the most suitable approach is not yet known;
Barbiturates, Midazolam, and Propofol are alternatively applicable effective substances.
For the treatment of an outdated rupture of the M. tibialis anterior tendon, either a tendon transposition or tendon transplantation is recommended.
Using a case study, the surgical care with an augmented reversal plastic is described;
Three years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with a good functional outcome.
The advantage of reversal plastic surgery is that it does not result in any functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies in many disease patterns.
The analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies, are primarily used to measure this parameter in intensive care patients.
The ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities, on the other hand, as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure, are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The goal is to validate the significance of these disease patterns.
Sepsis and MODS, diseases particularly relevant to intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomous function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The restriction of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("Uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be gaining increasing attractiveness in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report on 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the scalp hair.
The medical history revealed that all 3 patients regularly swam in a private swimming pool.
The examination of the hair using atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
Based on our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper through the swimming water of domestic swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjectively assessed health before and at various points after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), Expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measurement values were represented by the median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of patients with terminal heart failure rated their quality of life as very poor;
Already 6 weeks postoperative, this parameter improved, and 74% of the transplant recipients rated their quality of life as very good to excellent.
The patients were also very dissatisfied preoperatively with their physical performance (87%) and health condition (80%).
Six weeks after the transplant, these areas significantly improved, 76% of patients showed a high level of satisfaction with their health condition and 51% with their physical performance.
Although the patients already rated their mental state as good before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop).
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 months post-op.
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), and 6 months after transplantation, it correlated best with satisfaction with health condition (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation, and leisure activities improved after HTx in only about 28% of patients.
90% suffered from one or more complaints after the transplant, mostly side effects of the immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, all areas of quality of life, with the exception of mental well-being, significantly improve just 6 weeks after heart transplantation.
Despite high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and a contusion bleeding [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):] after a bicycle fall.
The space-occupying hematomas were evacuated through craniotomy.
High ICP values necessitated a barbiturate coma for over 10 days.
The patient developed septic lung failure on the 8th day after the trauma, complicating the situation.
The patient showed a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a severe restriction of mobility in both hip joints (Extension/Flexion:
0 Degrees/10 Degrees/20 Degrees, left:
Abduction/Adduction:
10 Degrees/0 Degrees/25 Degrees, left:
In the pelvic overview and computed tomography, ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker Type IV) were shown.
The HO were removed two years after the accident in two stages, each time via a Smith-Petersen approach.
The HO recurrence prevention was carried out by means of a single preoperative radiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of Indomethacin (150 mg/day) for 3 months.
The range of motion in the hip joints is as follows, 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, no recurrence of the HO has been shown so far.
The patient can engage in light farming activities 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that encodes for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
Using PCR, the DNA of isolates from the 7 most common dermatophytes was amplified, as well as that of some yeast and mold fungi.
Through hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides, the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans was achieved.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the differentiation of dermatophytes from yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of the PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples, as well as selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined with PCR and culture.
With PCR, dermatophytes were detected in 35 and with culture in 28 of the total 38 positively rated patient samples.
The sensitivity of the PCR (92%) was higher than that of the culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task area of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
Wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here, alongside functional radiological procedures.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and the scapholunate ligament apparatus are the most common indications for arthroscopic surgery.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has increasingly been used in forensic practice, archaeology, and evolutionary and population genetic studies over the last decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA, with special consideration of the non-coding hypervariable regions, is described.
Furthermore, the significance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological studies is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work aimed at extracting mitochondrial DNA from soil-stored teeth, hair shafts, and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented that could be solved with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to depict the findings reported in the literature as well as our own observations.
Microperimetric studies following surgical extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma occurs in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The operational effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), with its high soft tissue contrast, is the imaging method of choice for displaying intra-articular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labral lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows for the direct visualization of labrum lesions through the distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow for evaluation in the crucial cranioventral sections.
The labrum lesions can be classified into various clinically relevant stages using MRA.
Additionally, the representation of accompanying lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is possible.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
So far, no complications have occurred in the over 100 arthrographies performed to date.
Based on these experiences, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labral lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we used.
It was found that the varicose vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, this also affected the vein wall below a still intact vein valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause for the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall, particularly in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the overall view of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose transformation of the vein cannot be confirmed. Rather, there is initially a change in the vein wall, which also leads to valve insufficiency.
Arterial injuries as a direct result of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischemia may be absent.
The Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome represents a closure of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a result of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible.
This study aims to review the medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of Propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthesia induction and maintenance with Propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared to other anesthesia drugs or techniques, when used in Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA).
This article demonstrates how to best utilize the antiemetic effect of Propofol.
The possible effect of Propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotonergic system are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of Propofol regarding the reduction of PONV incidence in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined maxillofacial-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous maxilla through a repositioning osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of endosseous implants is rarely included in the preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept for 23 patients was determined based on the creation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special consideration of the front tooth aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified based on preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results achieved.
The profile prognosis with video imaging provides a meaningful decision-making aid in planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw, taking into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of the upper jaw advancement, direction of insertion of endosseous implants, and type of supraconstruction.
A report is presented on a large-nodular multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological aspect initially did not allow for a diagnosis.
The now more than 2-year spontaneous regression with the change from the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, as well as the lack of evidence of specific cell organelles, could secure the nature of the disease.
For the treatment of diseases of the rheumatic spectrum, thymus preparations are among the products offered on the German pharmaceutical market.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as investigations that do not allow scientifically substantiated statements due to short study duration and small number of patients.
On this basis, a medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived with a sufficient, positive benefit-risk assessment according to the state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report on an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the right hepatic artery in a 64-year-old patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, there were repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding leading to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to determine due to the condition after Billroth-II gastric resection.
The superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapeutic option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are quickly recognized and treatment is initiated within 3 hours of the onset of initial symptoms.
Often, valuable time is lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives, or witnesses.
The increase in this number can be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The current standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and the therapy of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the effectiveness of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with orally administered methadone in 40 opioid-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate (percentage of patients who remained in the study program for the entire duration and completed it as planned), additional consumption, and duration of stay were defined as target parameters.
A trend was observed in the retention rate (p=0.06) in favor of the group treated with Methadone, with an average daily dose of 7.3 mg Buprenorphine and an average dosage of 63 mg Methadone.
The dropout rate in the group treated with buprenorphine (n=20) was tentatively higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the group treated with methadone (n=20).
Regarding the additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine, no significant difference could be found between the two during the course of treatment.
In terms of duration of stay in the study, methadone proved to be the more successful substance (p=0.04).
How important and how meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional therapy failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the likelihood of the occurrence of hematogenous metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas were treated in a prospective study with radical radiotherapy and examined regarding clinical parameters, reflex otalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node involvement, and consumption habits.
29 patients received concurrent chemotherapy.
In accordance with the treatment concept, a radical neck dissection was performed on 25 out of 139 patients after completing radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were later treated with a "catch-up operation".
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 cases (55%), the suffering could be controlled locally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62 out of 139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor disease, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy), and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly influenced by the parameters of reflex pain (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03), and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time for patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months.
At this time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
In 23% (14/62) of the patients with uncontrolled locoregional disease, distant metastases were detected, compared to only 4/77 (5%) of the patients with cured locoregional disease (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau after 24 months.
The locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indicator for the likelihood of the development of distant metastases.
The failure of the therapy is due to the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume detection and spatial and temporal resolution in CT is achieved.
The new technical possibilities of MDCT, however, require a redefinition of examination strategies to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997, as well as 3 personal case observations, were evaluated based on symptoms and current therapy for European adder bites (Vipera berus).
The primary toxic effect consists of the development of potentially dangerous edemas;
If no signs of poisoning occur more than 2-3 hours after the event, the likelihood of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II discusses the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixator was applied in assembly form A and in 23 patients in assembly form B.
In 4 patients, a deep infection occurred, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients who were treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
A follow-up was conducted on 5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the patellar ligament in cases of caudal comminuted fractures, as well as 12 patients with transosseous suture fixation of the patellar ligament in cases of avulsions and tears at the lower patellar pole or suture adaptation of the patellar ligament in cases of intraligamentous rupture, in which no other treatments were performed on the knee joint apart from the extensor apparatus operation.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal, and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a strength deficit of 10-20% in the extensor muscles of the operated leg compared to the other side.
In summary, it can be stated that the EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven effective in continuity-restoring procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint and represents a capable alternative to patellotibial fixation with wire or synthetic band material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms nowadays make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.
This article presents the methods currently used for the diagnosis of acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies, the benefits of which have been examined in clinical studies.
Through the case study of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis triggered by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous hemorrhagic blisters occur recurrently from the beginning of the light-rich season until adulthood, which heal with scarring.
As part of a field test, we gathered experiences in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology, and gynecology.
The central imaging method in the radiological diagnosis of oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery is the panoramic layer image.
The reduction of the dose requirement has been made possible by further developments in device technology, X-ray films, and new detection systems such as sensors or storage foils.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional imaging types make imaging using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indispensable for numerous clinical questions in oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now allows, due to the reduction in measurement times, to also depict changes in the cortex.
For certain questions, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medical procedures allow for an imaging-supported functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is used today in both inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are particularly important for patients whose body awareness is reduced, who are limited in their emotional capacity, or who, due to character resistances, are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy.
The most commonly used methods today are listed with short examples, and other procedures are pointed out.
Among the influencing factors are, among others, the connection of the affects to the autonomic and voluntary nervous system, as well as the particularly close connection of psychological and physical processes at the beginning of life, which is associated with the respective form of interaction experienced and has psychobiological effects.
In further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important meaning for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented methods to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Attention is drawn to approaches to empirical research.
Psychotherapists live in a tension between the ideal and reality of family, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choice and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic work allows individuals a lot of flexibility to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy for female psychotherapists in particular to realize a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their impacts are described.
Finally, the positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should give the same attention to their personal relationships in their education and training as they do to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
Advanced heart failure, with a prevalence of 0.1%, is becoming increasingly important within the patient group with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice for drug-resistant heart failure.
The growing imbalance between the supply and demand for suitable donor organs, however, limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical therapy approaches have been developed.
The conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and anti-congestive beta blockers.
The surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded by the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assist hearts, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastic surgery, cardiomyoplasty, and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of the treatment significantly depends on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
For this, the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registries is necessary.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopedic University Hospital Bochum, the incidence of TLA procedures is compared to manual therapeutic maneuvers over the course of a year.
In contrast, there were 122 manual therapeutic maneuvers performed on the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine by the respective ward doctors who had completed further training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective disease pattern (pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar syndromes), manual therapy primarily addressed secondary findings in other spinal levels in patients with the mentioned diagnoses or with post-discectomy syndrome.
The migration of a retained lower jaw tooth from its place of formation to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of a retained lower premolar migrating to the muscular process, documented over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending branch of the lower jaw to the muscle process occurred after the completion of root growth, after the patient's 20th year of life.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there any concrete causes found in this patient for such an extensive migration.
The incidence of prostate cancer and cases curable by radical prostate vesiculectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical specimens determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical approach.
Since there is a lack of a standardized method for the preparation of the specimens internationally, the comparability of various scientific studies is made difficult.
The precise, rational allocation of preparations we propose is intended to solve these problems and help improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood-like increase in requirements for documentation, performance recording, economic efficiency and quality control, require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
Since 1992, a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use at the Orthopedic Clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific demands of the practicing physician have been particularly taken into account.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, surgery planning (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), surgery documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication (email, information systems), and clinical text processing.
Through the simultaneous integration of the WEB server in MedXS, content and functions can be accessed at the same time from any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM) from the intranet or internet.
The use of the application has achieved significant improvements in clinical processes and created far better conditions for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of the interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by nonspecific neurological symptoms and primarily facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukodermas (Piebaldism, Partial Albinism) is considered relatively typical and usually indicative.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a not to be underestimated cause of ventricular tachycardias (VT), especially in young patients.
The focus of the therapy is the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prevention of sudden cardiac death.
In individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM, there is a manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication according to standard therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to examine a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal level.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of total knee arthroplasty is still generally very controversially discussed.
In this context, our need is to gain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just in comparison to the prosthetically supplied patella.
The fact that we have only been performing patella replacement in special cases for almost 5 years has provided us with a patient base that can be studied for this question.
Based on 30 documented cases of total knee replacements with a 2-year follow-up, we have specifically focused on the natural and then the prosthetic femoral patellar bearing, assessing the patellar shift and tilt, and related the results to the range of motion achieved after 2 years and to persistent pain symptoms.
Regular adjustments were observed to the bony patella silhouette to fit the prosthesis bearing with densification of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous spacer layer;
7 patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" based on their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were there cases with postoperative shift over 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt over 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, complaints also correlated, with a significant difference to the problem-free collective, with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the patellar course (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic loosening of the tibial prosthesis.
After an axis-correcting exchange of the tibial components, this patient also became symptom-free and highly mobile again, without any surgical intervention on the patella and despite a considerable residual tilt remaining.
Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that a greater effort appears justified for recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps that favorably influence the course of the kneecap during implantation, a high quadriceps relocation or a medially offset refixation of the detached tuberosity may be required.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, as the non-prosthetically treated patella demonstrates remarkable adaptability to the prosthesis bearing surface through remodeling of bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative misalignment, where we did not perform a replacement due to good intraoperative bone quality, we also had to accept more late complications even with a normalized patellar course.
Whether an extended indication for patella replacement exists in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
By introducing comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably improved.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinic structures.
So far, measures focused on patient needs and the processing of internal treatment procedures have been prioritized.
To increase employee satisfaction and qualification, rehabilitation-specific training series were conducted.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Operational goal: Avoidance or elimination of compression on the neural structures.
The present work provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasias and neoplasias.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical, and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that defects in the respiratory chain occur more frequently in oncocytes of the parathyroid gland and also in the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It is assumed that oncocyte metaplasias pathogenetically differ from oncocyte neoplasias.
Furthermore, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly found in the thyroid, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient with long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to the autosomal recessive Acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes in this patient are also due to a zinc deficiency in the body.
The substitution of zinc leads to a remarkable improvement.
A comparison is made regarding the sexual behavior of 53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermatitis, and a skin-healthy sample of 52 individuals.
As test methods, questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a self-developed questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used.
The examined skin patients significantly differ from those with healthy skin in terms of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of affection is reduced in both genders, the ability to orgasm is significantly reduced in female patients.
People with psoriasis feel more impaired compared to patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been asked about their sexual life by their treating doctor.
Despite all the difficulties in addressing this intimate area, the dermatologist and venereologist should however be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for the sexual life.
The conventional X-ray image must still be considered as a basic examination today when there is a clinical question about inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential not only includes bony inflammatory destructions, but it also allows for the assessment of their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image can indicate a clinical flare-up situation through collateral phenomena and directly and indirectly depict the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths.
Furthermore, high-resolution computed tomography, particularly through the detailed representation of cortical bone structures - complementary to MR - provides highly specific information for certain specific questions, particularly on the trunk skeleton and individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis, and partly for surgical planning.
This applies, among other things, to the sacroiliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints, and the upper cervical spine.
The treatment of open tibial fractures of grade II and III with simultaneous soft tissue damage nowadays includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
Only through the associated successes in recent decades has it been possible to significantly reduce the previously high rate of disabling amputations and infections.
Initially, these were only isolated observations, but the signs increased that these patients frequently exhibited soft tissue problems on the lower leg, ranging from recurrent swelling tendencies to ulcus cruris.
Based on a clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy subjects, it was shown that more than 50% of all patients suffered a clinically relevant damage to the venous system due to the accident.
Here, the severity of this damage can range from a simple tendency to swell to a venous leg ulcer, which increase in clinical relevance over time since the accident.
To avoid further, including iatrogenic, damage, strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is necessary, postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Operational goal: Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal malformations of the tibia through corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of form and function of the limb.
Muzines are heavily glycosylated glycoproteins that exhibit a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry has provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues were described.
A series of recent results also suggests that mucin-associated antigens play a significant role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present study, including our own findings, provides an overview of gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
The establishment of rheumatology centers in Germany in recent years has enabled a network between outpatient and inpatient areas with the resident general practitioners, internal and orthopedic rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists, as well as acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatology control centers can contribute in the long term to improving cooperation between all doctors, therapists, and clinics involved in the care of rheumatic patients, and ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic patients in terms of comprehensive rheumatological quality management, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Despite the increasing frequency of medico-legal problems, knowledge about the type and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaint cases from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical associations of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg resulted in 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert commissions identified treatment errors.
The complaint concerned the surgeon in 95% of cases, the anesthesiologist in 2%, both disciplines in 3%, and once an ENT doctor.
90% of the complaints were related to complications after routine thyroid procedures.
Surgery-specific complications such as recurrent nerve palsy (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postoperative bleeding (3%) and late recurrence (1%) accounted for 63% of the allegations of treatment errors, but only 31% of the confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), residual nodes (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of the complaints, but 70% of the treatment errors.
Only 11% of the identified treatment errors were due to lack of information.
The determination of a treatment error was particularly common when a reoperation was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by an error in postoperative care (p < 0.001).
The "Environment and Health" sector is characterized by an interdisciplinary nature and a resulting high need for communication.
Adding to the difficulty, significant problems can sometimes arise during the information gathering process.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications are bilateral kidney tumors, kidney tumors in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys, and in patients with impaired kidney function who are at risk of dialysis-dependent kidney failure after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Through operational strategic improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and work-bench surgery, over 95% of patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors can be spared from a nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after kidney tumor surgery that preserves the organ in imperative indications, an increasing number of centers recommend the expansion of kidney tumor surgery that spares the parenchyma to a selected group of patients with a healthy kidney on the opposite side (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal cell carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears to be low.
The prognosis after the manifestation of local recurrences is unfavorable in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has been most frequently described in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report on 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or a carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and research question.
To develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterial skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogs is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective but also has minimal side effects.
In the following, a case is reported of a patient who, as part of this combination treatment, exhibited pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the healed psoriasis lesions.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
Various lithotripters have been developed based on largely similar technical principles.
In the current discussion, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence are the focus, which make further appropriate prophylaxis reasonable.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL alongside other forms of therapy are still lacking.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior eye segment with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), isolated cases of acute corneal calcification were observed clinically.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted us to conduct the following investigations.
The simultaneous occurrence of a pregnancy after in-vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and an active tuberculosis infection can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case report, we present the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis following IVF pregnancy.
Various options are being discussed.
The ABO blood groups, first described in 1901 by Karl Landsteiner, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] with the help of the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and visualized on a polyacrylamide gel using silver staining after restriction digestion.
The following allele frequencies were determined in a southwestern German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, Allele B = 0.0741, and Allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 examined individuals (3.57%), the chosen examination method, which only considers nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, as differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic clarification.
That exceptions must apply is to be demonstrated by the following case study.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a soccer game.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, nodular, connective tissue-transformed hematoma that could be easily removed with a Hol:
During the soccer game, there was an obvious occurrence of bleeding due to a bruise or patellar subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after the arthroscopy, and the muscle atrophy quickly regressed.
Two-thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids have a rapid and lasting effect on inflammation symptoms in the short and medium term.
Data is presented suggesting a longer-term effect (longer than one year).
Recent studies clearly demonstrate a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of inflammation inhibition from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these newer studies also provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes of the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes, which are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop to some extent independently of each other.
It is interesting to speculate whether these various effects of glucocorticoids could be related to different mechanisms, presented elsewhere at this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and -chains of 1-, 3-, and 4-integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) exhibit pronounced intra- and interindividual variation and different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
Until today, it is unclear whether the AM has functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells, or whether they only represent "biological redundancy" or merely the very last binding security (final insurance).
The marking of sperm-AM was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-Acetyl-5-Methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors, with a diverse range of effects.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an increase in the evening and a nightly peak between 2:00 and 4:00 AM.
Additionally, melatonin possesses the ability to freely diffuse through cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in both extracellular and intracellular spaces, independently of a receptor system, due to its strong lipophilic properties.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly large.
In dermatology, melatonin offers potential perspectives for some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical application, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
Some information is available on the penetration properties through the skin and oral bioavailability, which can be supplemented by further studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies on one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals that allow for the localization of an inflammatory focus when the origin is unclear, due to the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT technology, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals that, for example, enable the detection of leukocyte infiltration.
Both methodological approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can further specify a detected focus or lead to an inflammation scintigraphy in case of unclear findings.
Background and research question.
Cryosurgery has been established as a method for treating capillary infantile hemangiomas for a long time.
Surprisingly, however, detailed studies proving their effectiveness in tumors regularly undergoing spontaneous regression are still lacking.
The patient's prognosis depends on both the primary mechanical brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.
Causes of secondary brain damage include intracranial space-occupying lesions due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema formation, as well as the resulting ischemia and inflammatory processes.
Both in isolated TBI and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "systemic response" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but their combination and accumulation can be fatal.
Hypermetabolic states after a TBI are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of a TBI on the rest of the organism must be compared to the influence of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-related perfusion disorders can cause a prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
Furthermore, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood clotting, metabolism, and fracture healing.
The knowledge of trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of currently applied therapeutic measures, is still insufficient and requires further clarification.
Ultimately, from this perspective, the choice of the right timing for secondary interventions that do not directly serve life preservation and lead to additional stress on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This work attempts to summarize important aspects in this field.
For better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, as well as for early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision aids.
Children with facial clefts have an increased risk of additional malformations.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
The literature references on the incidence of heart defects vary significantly.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared to 599 completers and examined for noticeable personality traits.
Furthermore, they were asked about their personal reasons for dropping out via a questionnaire.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, also known as keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin, is an early childhood manifest, dominantly inherited dermatosis with partially circular scaling erythemas, particularly in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal association with the winter half-year and the characteristic histologically multiform findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematous-squamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological, and initial immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be traced.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating Chronic Polyarthritis (CP), Spondyloarthropathies (SPA), Lupus Erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic Scleroderma (SD) were reviewed in terms of their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the reviewed works show significant shortcomings.
In this study, it was to be examined whether visual acuity decreases depending on the presentation time, and whether normal individuals and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in driving ability assessment.
Sudeck's Syndrome affects a limb after a microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck's Syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck's Syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to an injury or surgery of a limb.
His theory did not gain any followers, as the majority of the medical community believes that Sudeck's Syndrome is triggered by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of an anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory proposed by Paul Sudeck.
In this work, methods for applying fast multi-slice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
Computed tomography, in addition to the radiological examination methods commonly used in dentistry, allows for an overlay-free representation of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to its established use in the diagnosis of malignant diseases, CT has proven effective in addressing further questions.
If the examination is performed with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retained teeth in the jawbone and the damage caused by the retained teeth to permanent teeth can be assessed, allowing for early therapy.
If the periodontal gap of the retained tooth can be delineated, orthodontic alignment is possible.
In cases of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone loss must be accurately determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic lesions can be detected with CT.
Before a planned implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by carefully considering the remaining bone substance and the position of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape, and number of implants can be determined.
In up to 70% of all patients with sepsis, septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs.
The symptomatology of SE is described using case studies.
The main symptom is impaired consciousness up to coma.
The cranial computed tomography is usually normal as well, but a generalized brain edema may occur.
In the electroencephalogram, a general change is observed, which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products and the bacteremia itself are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disruption in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock, and ischemia, as well as liver and kidney failure, can be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate therapy for sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE as a possible initial symptom of sepsis has special diagnostic significance.
The endogenous endophthalmitis in severe systemic diseases and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal, and surgical therapy.
Movies tell stories.
The scenes in which people are faced with decision-making conflicts are particularly suspenseful.
Medical ethical conflicts not only appear in medical dramas or disease portrayals, but often in genres where this topic is hardly expected:
Comedies, Westerns, Romance, Gangster, and Crime films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions in films, they draw on moral values and at the same time serve as seismographs for the societal relevance of medical ethics issues.
However, in the film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the presented conflict situations resembles a medical ethics case discussion and provides a helpful addition for teaching analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in restenosis rate compared to conventional PTCA has led to stent implantation becoming the most frequently performed initial intervention.
Therefore, in-stent restenosis - especially the long-segment form - represents a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries poses significant challenges to emergency services.
Especially the initial care of the amputated limb in amputation injuries, in addition to the initial care of the injured person, often determines the success of the restoration measures.
The primary goal of larynx imaging diagnostics is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic evaluation.
Consequently, the general rule is to perform imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings from endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical relationships of the skeleton, internal structures, and surroundings of the larynx will be presented synoptically.
The instability was eliminated by a transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system while maintaining segmental function.
In recent years, new insights have been gained into the post-traumatic changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to appropriate changes in neurotraumatological-intensive care management, this has led to the development of drugs aimed at reducing the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
In the context of this work, the recent findings on the pathophysiological changes after TBI and the basic pharmacological intervention options are discussed.
While some of the medications are already in clinical use, others are in various stages of experimental and clinical testing.
Background and research question.
Melanoma patients in stage IV with progressive disease course pose a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the disease progression of melanoma patients who had exhausted all other treatment options.
A well-known side effect of Minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for over 3 years due to pulmonary silicosis before symptomless blackish spots appeared on his face.
In the other patient, gray-black spots appeared on both lower legs after only 6 months of taking minocycline for folliculitis.
A test treatment with the ruby laser led to a reduction in pigmentation in the treated area for this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed using case examples.
Operational goal: Removal of the deformity of a superducted and varus fifth digit.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area in recent years.
A significant factor in this is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
In the context of this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve was investigated after partial tumor resection and reconstruction with the vascular pedicled thoracic long nerve.
Pressure and pain sensations could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months, and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly pedicled N. thoracicus longus thus represents a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the N. alveolaris inferior in tumor patients.
The intake of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) is the most common cause of deliberate drug overdose in the United States and the United Kingdom, yet severe complications occur in only a relatively small number of cases among the large number of overdoses.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient who has exceeded the standard dosage and has reached the hepatotoxic minimum dose of 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets for a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as quickly as possible.
Furthermore, a complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be performed for every patient whose strength or timing of overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function worsens.
At the onset of signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in case of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has significantly improved the fate of a previously incurable group of patients. However, further improvement can only be achieved through closer collaboration between the referring hospitals and the specialized facilities for liver diseases.
Background and research question.
Itching is a difficult-to-treat symptom of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases.
In recent years, Capsaicin, an alkaloid from the chili pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
Capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers during topical application after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itch and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological condition that is both diagnostically and therapeutically problematic.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low, with 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for therapy-resistant testicular pain.
12 patients underwent surgical treatment with spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate diagnostic evaluation:
The M. cremastericus is severed using bipolar diathermy, and the adventitia of the A. testicularis is detached under microsurgical conditions for a length of 2-3 cm.
At a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be considered in the therapeutic considerations for patients with chronic testicular pain.
The high success rate of our surgical approach can only be maintained with precise indication, making it essential to have accurate diagnostic testing to rule out a specific cause of testicular pain.
In neurosurgery, the trend is also moving towards less invasive surgical techniques to avoid large trepanations, minimize the preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, and thus keep the risk of neurological and psychological disorders as low as possible.
The hospital stay and work incapacity can often be shortened.
A significant "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
The brain, with its preformed cavities, the ventricles, and the subarachnoid space, provides good conditions for the use of an endoscope.
The most common indication for a neuroendoscopic procedure is obstructive hydrocephalus.
But arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors, and smaller intraventricular space-occupying lesions can also be effectively treated endoscopically through a small drill hole.
By using specialized instruments, lasers, and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, such as cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a variety of spinal disorders and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as an adjuvant in microsurgical operations.
The aim of the study was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
The DW-MRI measures the tissue-specific ADC, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In tumor tissue with numerous cells and numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e., diffusion barriers), a low ADC is expected, while in tissue with few cells or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is expected.
In a 53-year-old man, a melanotic lung tumor was found that completely closed off the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a sleeve resection of the left lower lung lobe was performed.
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as malignant melanoma.
In the medical history, there was no indication of a previous removal of a skin, mucous membrane, or eye alteration.
The targeted examinations of the skin and eye also revealed no evidence of a localized primary tumor.
Thus, the new formation is considered a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases have been confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far, there are no experiences regarding twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore examined twilight vision before and after LASIK for the correction of myopia.
In recent years, Dobutamine stress echocardiography has become a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnosis.
With ultra-fast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacological stress protocols can be performed, as currently used in echocardiography.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost during organ culture storage.
This study investigated whether it involves a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LC).
DNA cytometry has evolved into a routine diagnostic technique, primarily used for assessing ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis) in breast cancer.
In this case, static cytometry (microscope cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry due to its lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically flawless technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The obtained parameters, primarily the S-phase and the proliferation index, and secondarily the ploidy, represent important factors for prognosis and therapy planning.
A precise understanding of the method and possible errors is essential for interpreting the results.
To what extent immunohistochemical techniques provide equivalent information for determining proliferation kinetics is currently considered unresolved.
Further developments involve the introduction of multiparametric examinations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of measured values.
Injection therapy plays a significant role in the treatment of cervical syndromes.
This article covers both general prerequisites and various practical approaches to injection.
Summary: The coverage of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear, while the question of coverage by private health insurance is not to be considered.
The legal basis for cost coverage will not include the regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical precautionary measures (§ 23 SGB V), and health examinations (§ 25 SGB V).
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special treatment form PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as corresponding recommendations from the federal committees are missing.
It would be desirable for appropriate recommendations to be adopted soon in order to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, a cost assumption obligation may be considered according to the principles of the legal concept of so-called new examination and treatment methods.
The German-Austrian recommendations for PEP, however, need to be clarified in terms of indication and application and freed from ambiguities.
If a doctor does not apply PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, it will not be considered a treatment error, as there are still too many uncertainties from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
The organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present study examines the significance of an extended corneal storage time for the success of a penetrating keratoplasty.
Based on personal experiences with 3-dimensional echocardiography, attempts were made to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanelle studies in 3 dimensions and to examine their informational content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients who were systemically treated with rifabutin due to a Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation, developed heterotopic ossifications in 5 major body joints, resulting in almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant due to severe pulmonary hypertension.
By resecting the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the ipsilateral elbow, as well as both hip joints, mobility was restored.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur especially after trauma, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, intoxications, and in long-term comas.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause the formation of new bone.
The diagnosis is made using imaging techniques.
Prophylactically, a drug treatment using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation, or a combination of both methods can be performed.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) in whom we used the argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-standing skin changes that were not or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After the application of the argon laser, the treated lesions experienced complete and permanent healing.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vessel-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-induced discoid lesions.
Within the context of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is demonstrated for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are overall the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
The prophylaxis of HBV reinfection using polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analog Lamivudine is effective, but expensive.
Reinfection with Hepatitis C regularly occurs in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
An effective reinfection prophylaxis for Hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires further extensive studies.
In Hepatitis C, after reinfection, the prognosis for the transplant is less favorable, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity based on a case study and the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiation therapy.
An exception is rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation for pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative approach.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentry tachycardias of varying incidence, duration, and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of other structures in the excitation conduction system, and the detection of additional para-specific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Anomalies of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coinciding heart diseases should be examined before intervention using echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of the procedure with contrast imaging.
In 300 patients with various variants of pre-excitation syndrome, our own results of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a higher quality recording of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over the years, standardization of nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
Since January 1, 1997, the Heidelberg Orthopedic University Hospital Foundation has maintained a comprehensive, consented register of all early complications for all inpatient patients.
The complications are recorded prospectively by the medical staff in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature, and the information is checked, corrected, and supplemented by the clinic's quality management department, as well as classified.
The guide aims to contribute to the discussion about a standard in the collection and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the goal of consensus building.
The acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the area of the acra in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, an impairment of the dermoepidermal coherence that occurs obligatorily during the course of treatment is likely to be the cause, which becomes clinically manifest in the form of taut blisters due to mechanical stress.
The acrobullous photodermatosis must be differentiated diagnostically from phototoxic reactions that occur due to excessive UVA exposure or high psoralen concentrations.
Based on two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of this disease pattern are presented.
In addition to the autopsied findings of a fibrolipomatous replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology developed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological characteristics, which have been divided into primary and secondary criteria.
The following study on a collective of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, aims to verify the validity of the developed criteria.
Global or segmental dilations of the right ventricle, in the sense of main criteria, could be detected in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) showed only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of the right ventricular myocardium was histologically detected.
T-wave inversions in right precordial leads as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS widening of more than 110 msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), and an epsilon wave was found in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis using signal-averaged ECG was only available for 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of secondary criteria.
Left bundle branch-like ventricular tachycardias, which were classified as secondary criteria, were detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died without proven arrhythmias due to progressive right heart failure.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion was found in 3 out of 19 patients (15%).
The developed task force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a confirmed histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without the addition of histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a purely clinical diagnosis is more feasible through a more favorable classification of findings into primary and secondary criteria.
Clear data shows that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia on cerebral ischemia is controversially assessed.
The conflicting results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained when different stroke types are considered separately and the time course of blood sugar levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to exacerbate neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia if there is insufficient collateral supply.
Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, an acute increase in blood sugar can protect nerve tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply if there is only a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow.
This situation occurs in the area of the penumbra and with good collateral circulation.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative as well as the positive effects of acute hyperglycemia are dependent on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgery diagnostics, according to which a resective epilepsy surgery procedure was performed on 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies.
The localization agreement of findings from non-invasive EEG-video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET), and ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) formed the basis for focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or experienced seizures very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if localized MRI lesions were present and the resections could be carried out at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a series of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, especially temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG recordings are sufficient for pre-surgical diagnostics, thus avoiding the risk of invasive EEG examinations.
Medical history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented at an external clinic with a newly occurring absolute tachyarrhythmia.
Initially, an echocardiogram raised suspicion of an intracardiac mass, which was to be further investigated using transesophageal echocardiography.
In the EKG, a Tachyarrhythmia absoluta was found with frequencies up to 146/min, and an intermittent sinus rhythm was also documented.
This could also be confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large space-occupying lesion projecting onto the posterior mediastinum, extending laterally beyond the right mediastinal margin.
Due to the displacing growth of the cyst causing atrial arrhythmias and to safely rule out malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed via anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in sinus rhythm and only complains about occasional "dropouts," most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primary harmless-looking atrial rhythm disorders can also have rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intracardiac space-occupying lesions, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is provided.
Acute cranial nerve palsies can have a variety of causes.
A rare cause of paralysis of one or multiple cranial nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even with atypical symptoms, is important because timely initiation of anticoagulant therapy can prevent a stroke resulting from dissection-related embolism.
We report on 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder Syndrome) and the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard Syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so any sudden painful cranial nerve failure must also suggest a carotid dissection.
The incorrect origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remaining asymptomatic until old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnostics and surgical treatment of a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as the necessity of surgical correction.
The suspicion diagnosis was made accidentally during echocardiographic procedures, and the safety diagnosis was made through coronary angiography.
The operation involved the transplantation of the coronary artery malformation without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was complication-free.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3, and C1-3) places high demands on trauma management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of joint-related fractures offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving good functional results through minimal, surgically induced soft tissue trauma.
The goal is to achieve at least exercise stability, even when compared to standard procedures.
In addition to the minimal soft tissue trauma, arthroscopy offers the advantage of precise intraoperative assessment of joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular accompanying injuries compared to conventional procedures.
Out of a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in our clinic for 34 patients between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up examination of a total of 17 patients showed overall good results according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In selected patient cases, we consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable for fractures of the AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, after a moderate traumatic brain injury, developed bilateral hypoglossal paresis without any other neurological deficits, which clinically resolved completely within 3 months.
Since no skull base fracture in the area of the posterior cranial fossa could be detected by computed tomography, we discuss a bilateral strain of the N. hypoglossus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The congestion spreads from the large guiding veins through the smallest venules into the area of microcirculation and ultimately affects the metabolism of the tissues.
As a basis for classification principles, typical clinical features are best suited, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement method.
The Stewart-Bluefarb Syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the basis of arteriovenous short-circuit connections.
In the lower extremities, skin changes usually occur unilaterally, resembling a Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain, and rarely hypertrophy of the affected extremity.
The disease often progresses rapidly and leads to ulcerating nodules with a tendency to bleed and become infected.
The causal therapy consists of eliminating the arteriovenous shunts.
An operative approach is rarely feasible due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
The superselective embolization is more suitable, however, with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
The successful embolization treatment, which has been performed a total of 8 times, is reported for a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb Syndrome.
So far, the precise diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin has been based on clinical and histological examination of H&E sections, electron microscopy (Birbeck granules), and immunohistology on frozen sections (CD1a).
Advancements in the development and analysis of paraffin-compatible markers now allow for the (even retrospective) processing and precise classification of these diseases in formalin-fixed material.
Using antibodies against S-100 protein and the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classic cells of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can be distinguished from other histiocytic cell systems.
For the so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LCH), there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-compatible immunohistochemical markers can vary greatly within different clinical entities.
Diagnostic significance in distinguishing from Langerhans cell histiocytosis appears to be provided by antibodies against factor XIIIa (demonstrated in the case of disseminated xanthoma) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (demonstrated in juvenile xanthogranuloma).
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epithelioid cells typical for the disease process.
In the following, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of Allopurinol application and after re-exposure to this medication.
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
In world literature, 7 case reports of non-bilharzia-associated verrucous carcinoma of the bladder have been published so far.
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not been described so far, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma seems to lie in the chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting conservative treatment options, a radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for fixing tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy-derived organ samples were used for testing NoToX.
Conventional histological stains and accepted immunohistochemical stains, particularly for tumor diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these independent investigations carried out at 3 different institutions, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX show no differences in terms of reproducibility of conventional staining or visualization of immunohistochemical reactions compared to formalin-fixed tissue samples.
NoToX has proven to be a useful substitute for formalin.
To describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the "multiple scan average dose" (MSAD), and the axial dose free in air are commonly used.
The CTDI and the MSAD derived from it are good measures of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but they say little about the doses relevant from the perspective of the doctor and the patient, according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and the risks involved.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure for the effective dose, which allows an estimation of the risk.
The specification of an upper guideline value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirement of the examination region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid unnecessarily high risk on the other hand.
As physical quantities, all three sizes are useful for characterizing and differentiating various examination programs and devices in terms of radiation exposure.
According to a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been newly included in this definition.
Consequently, a series of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, and herpesviruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and dilation of the ventricles.
It seems reasonable to assign a separate place to shame as a universally human emotion, distinguishing it from guilt.
In this context, the self-preserving function of shame should also be considered alongside its defensive character.
The occurrence of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of value, even if it may not be currently recognizable in the patient.
The signaling character of shame is discussed, and the question is considered whether shame symptoms have a pathological value.
Taking into account the psychogenesis and the unconscious shame dynamics broadens the perspective on potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review article provides a literature overview of the highly heterogeneous treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods, as well as professional responsibility.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, specific disorder- and event-specific concepts, and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents, and young adults from the last 10 years are described.
Additionally, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, as far as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response, as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis, has been the subject of research in recent years.
Atherosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
Increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (Group 1) and 24 patients with stable angina (Group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL test for detection of fragmented DNA) and electron microscopically.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, detection and quantification of cell death events, and the differentiation between apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study conducted in vivo and on specially fixed cadavers using techniques developed by Thiel in 1992, it was investigated in which positional relationship the transversalis fascia is to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In TEP, the fascia can be used at most laterally to the artery as reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment for fixing foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin changes.
The detection of numerous mites in the scaly crusts led to the diagnosis of Norwegian scabies;
An underlying illness could be ruled out in both cases.
It is suspected that the months-long therapy for eczema, in the sense of immunosuppression, has led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are being evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions in terms of O2 transport and, in particular, effective O2 delivery to tissues has been demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
Through genetic and chemical modifications, the hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 hours, adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
As a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today, a certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well-tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with very high gas solubility, making them well-suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation, and also during resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsion group, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and the acute care of injured patients.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological principles.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, in which it either represents the only causally effective, life-saving treatment or an essential, often decisive therapy component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive care.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotraumas of the lung, the possibility of central nervous system oxygen intoxication should be particularly considered.
The clinical application of HBO requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects, and risks, as well as targeted and critical indication setting and the ability and skills to safely manage complications with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation, with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical, or intensive care character, should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthesiologist.
Our interest lies in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues in relation to oncological therapy.
In this work, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound, due to its good depth focusing ability, could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for acoustically accessible tumors.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive magnetic resonance temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy for human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical studies.
The long-term effects of premature birth on the eye and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) status were to be demonstrated in a group of extremely small preterm infants.
Since 1993, an IT system for surgery and outpatient documentation, as well as for supporting general clinic organization, has been in use at the Orthopedic University Hospital Homburg/Saar.
The hardware consists of a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a specialized database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-driven encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the system has recorded data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 surgeries.
With appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of administration can be taken into account.
Through further, clinic-wide networking, the University Hospital Homburg also offers the possibility for cross-departmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks as well as the internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to examine whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupil reaction.
It is also pointed out that non-medical reasons contribute to the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
In this study on sheep, it was to be determined whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether a temporal assignment can be made, and whether the results provide an indication for the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or osteoarthritis marker.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each:
The control group consists of knee joints from the contralateral side and knee joints from animals in other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological score values between the TD vs. ME and MV groups are statistically significantly different (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, the HA in the ME and MV groups shows a significantly increased value.
In the CS, both the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial severance show a significantly increased level (p < 0.01).
Clinical Consequences:
The HA mirror allows - at least experimentally - to some extent, a description of the degree of osteoarthritis.
The concentration increases with a larger postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
The idiopathic Long QT Syndrome can present itself in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
The therapy with beta-blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In case of therapy failure, options include a pacemaker implantation or a surgical sympathetic blockade.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in a 95/12-year-old patient.
The description includes additions and usage of an epidiascope, which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ slices in general and special pathology courses, saving the need for elaborate video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic issues are common in later life and have far-reaching implications.
These problems are related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between the ego and the ego ideal in old age.
In three aspects, pathological exacerbations of the aging process, as they often occur in older patients, are shown.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transference in these patients are described, and possibilities and goals in the treatment of older patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the Muscle Energy Technique according to Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disturbances in joint mobility in the pelvis, spine, and ribs can be diagnosed with the Muscle Energy Technique.
The therapy has a high success rate.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chiropractic techniques with impulse.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint pain, recurrent diarrhea, and sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings, and histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
According to our findings, a combined occurrence of these various disease patterns has not been described before.
By introducing a gluten-free diet, there is a rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be considered the actual disorder in the structure of individual immunological disease patterns.
In industrialized countries, it is more likely medical conditions rather than lack of food that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the older population, affecting 5-12% of independently living individuals, 30-61% of hospitalized individuals, and 40-85% of older persons in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A heightened awareness of nutritional issues and a prompt risk assessment by the doctor are essential prerequisites to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important in terms of evaluating potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
From the comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi using light microscopy, statistically significant differences were found for 12 structural features.
Digitiform radial extensions, blue-gray reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots on a blue/gray background, pseudopod-like border zones, and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific incident light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several individual features suggestive of malignancy, occurring in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy methods in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently used vector-based transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into their respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
First clinical applicability studies, in which such a gene (IRAP) was transferred, represent a significant step forward on the path to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic lower jaws.
We report on our experiences with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral applications in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia as part of syndromic conditions.
This involved 1 boy with Pierre-Robin Syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar Syndrome, 1 infant with Nager Syndrome, and 1 rare case of midline defect in 18p Syndrome.
The distraction period ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm achieved.
Older individuals interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the diverse opportunities that the internet offers them in terms of information, communication, and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and facilities for elderly education are called upon to facilitate access to the world of digital media for older people through target group-specific offers, support them in acquiring media competence, and create interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on experiences from the information campaign "Senior-Info-Mobil," possibilities are described for providing people over 50 with access to new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects, it is further demonstrated how spatially and temporally decoupled 'research-based learning' for older adults in the form of virtual working groups and networks could become the driving force behind a "new learning culture" that also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or cannot participate in local offerings due to health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has largely been replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technological advancement of MRI tomography in recent years has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods.
The MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of simultaneously capturing morphological and functional parameters through a non-invasive method without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine-MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the advancement of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in a single examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic method that offers a complete evaluation of heart diseases in a single examination, both for initial examination and for follow-up control.
Due to the rapid progress in development, existing limitations, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be resolved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development in documentation and computer science at the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is provided.
Since its founding in 1967, 4 development phases can be distinguished:
First medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, implementation of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus management of performance events.
Planning and implementation were carried out in accordance with the framework plans and concepts of the university hospitals of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac massage.
It is the first published case.
We report a case of bacterial arteritis following PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with subsequent septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyema, and formation of an infected false aneurysm.
The cause must be assumed to be a contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vessel segment with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The issue: Six-year-old boy with a type II unilateral cleft foot, oligodactyly, and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current state of the controversy surrounding the indication for patellar resurfacing.
The current state of knowledge in experimental and biomechanical fields is described, as well as the design features of various implant types and the specific aspects of patella preparation.
Furthermore, the author deals with the essential clinical studies on the topic of patellar surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
In conclusion, the discussion will address why the indication for patellar surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for replacing the patellar surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to altered stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is often observed in adults after organ transplantations as a result of treatment with hypertensive drugs such as Cyclosporin A, Tacrolimus (FK 506), or Prednisolone.
There is currently very little research on blood pressure behavior in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" refers to the absence of visible fracture signs in the conventional radiography performed for initial diagnosis, despite the presence of a fracture.
The diagnosis is only made during the course or through further diagnostic procedures.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations performed for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a method for both early diagnosis of "occult fractures" and the diagnosis of possible accompanying chondral and ligamentous injuries.
In the present study, we report on 23 patients with traumatic fractures in 5 different anatomical regions, where the diagnosis could be made with MRI in cases of negative X-ray findings.
The athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon already described early on.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small end-arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Due to the highly variable clinical picture and the diagnosis that can only be confirmed invasively or post-mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the embolism risk for patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient-year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolisms.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is a cause of embolic complications during surgical procedures or catheterizations of the aorta.
In patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta, characterized by pedunculated and mobile thrombi originating from localized plaques, anticoagulants proved to be effective.
Recurrent embolisms were prevented and a regression of the thrombi was observed.
A report on a 62-year-old patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and extension inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar femoral comminuted fracture, which was treated with a dynamic condylar screw osteosynthesis two years ago.
Here, the indication for a varus and extension correction osteotomy and osteosynthesis using a retrograde femoral nail was made.
The patient was able to fully bear weight on the right lower extremity with successful axis alignment within the first postoperative week.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method for achieving good and load-stable osteosynthesis, even in corrective surgeries.
Tear duct surgeries at the University Eye Clinic Münster on 296 children from the years 1987 - 1992 were examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspicious, but not in themselves conclusive for carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nuclear size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically assessed in each case and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (with positive detection of basal cells) safely rule it out.
In the present review, various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, a maintenance therapy of 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. every 14 days was compared to a monthly dose of 50mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters just one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, there was an increase in inflammation parameters despite the further administration of the test substance.
Simultaneously, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
The report is about a 13-month-old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested the suspicion of a vascular process.
Even healthy newborns are entitled to optimal care to ensure that any disturbances in postnatal adaptation are detected in a timely manner.
The introduction of painless, simple, yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has significantly simplified the situation for all responsible individuals.
Background and research question.
In light of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in Berlin-isolated gonococcal strains should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are performed in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aqua jogging is used as a regeneration training and as a "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance areas.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is excellent for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for musculoskeletal disorders, as well as for endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction include vascular surgery or prosthetic procedures.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy for a selected group of patients.
The main criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, and exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be adjusted from initial short-term successes of over 80% to approximately 53-55%.
Venous surgery has lost its significance due to a drastic decrease in long-term success rates (averaging below 40%).
Penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term survival rates of the implants and a patient satisfaction rate of 89%.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the intervention often forces this treatment option to the last place in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the device type, complications may occur such as cylinder defects and perforations, with 5-year survival rates of the implants ranging between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by a perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal transplants, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our 3-year experience with the homologous central limbal keratoplasty method we developed.
Pentosan polysulfate is relatively commonly used for bladder instillation and significantly reduces the frequency of nocturia, while the daytime micturition frequency remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also reduced the frequency of nocturia in an open prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the internet is increasing in all areas of use, and this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of websites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, creating competition with commercial offerings.
After the initial experiences, the task today is to critically evaluate the possibilities and risks of using the internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive symptoms are normal reactions for parents after a sudden infant death (SID).
In the following, we report from a psychiatric and forensic medical perspective on 2 cases in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SIDS and blamed themselves for having killed their child.
In conclusion, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are provided.
The review of cases of 110 children who were admitted with Burkitt lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, over a period of 7 years showed a predominance of male over female patients (1.9:1).
and a peak age of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen, and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that in the etiology of the tumor, a relationship between infections caused by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses and malnutrition could play a role.
The most important medication is Cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this medication with Vincristine and Methotrexate is equally effective in initiating the regression of the disease, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of the patients showed a good survival rate.
The Zwickau Clinic has been a widely known surgical center since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia.
His direct successors, Kulenkampff and Mayer, have preserved, continued, and expanded Braun's life's work.
Important impulses for general and local anesthesia, hospital construction and clinic organization, as well as surgical teaching in word and image, came from the Zwickau surgery.
After a brief literature review, the less described aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania in an adolescent patient will be presented.
In the context of early fears of abandonment, the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggression lead to a renewed threat of being dropped.
The symptom, which has so far served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and anxieties, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unclear erythematous-squamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The often difficult-to-treat skin changes occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of Dithranol, a substance that, however, can cause pustular dermatitis as an unwanted effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report on the occurrence of pustular dermatitis following the application of a mistakenly 50 times too concentrated dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance, as it can be successfully treated and even cured in many cases as a secondary form of hypertension through interventional radiological or vascular surgical measures.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
A report on an andrological patient whose initial examination revealed a severe case of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a ureaplasma infection.
The elevated FSH level and the significantly below-normal testicle size indicated a pronounced testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be considered as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After an antibiotic couple therapy with Doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery phase under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E, as well as the trace element zinc, a significant improvement in the spermogram was observed.
After another 2 months, a pregnancy was achieved through intrauterine insemination, resulting in the birth of a healthy daughter.
At this point, the patient only had a mild case of teratozoospermia.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthesia methods.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy during systemic therapy with corticosteroids should be described.
The X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in young children, alongside sonography.
The toddler's legs should be kept in a middle position.
Avoid side rotations and excessive tilting of the pelvis.
Looking back on 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which most recently took a step back to the 19th century with the "open approach" involving the unfolding of the nasal tip.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
A sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty is recommended in the sense of minimally traumatic surgery.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially premature newborns, the chest X-ray is of primary importance.
Profound knowledge of the normal chest image and possible physiological peripartal changes are prerequisites for the interpretation of neonatal chest radiographs.
Childhood Pathologies:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes that the radiologist encounters in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnosis of adult patients.
Many of these changes can be life-threatening for the patient or can affect their quality of life in the future.
Early diagnosis in close collaboration with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the most important pathologies that a radiologist may encounter in their daily routine.
The primary tumors included breast carcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcomas (n = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanomas (n = 9), gastric carcinomas (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (each n = 6), as well as 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor involvement (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 out of 140 (49%) cases, and in the 120 first resections, an extrahepatic tumor was present in 51% (n = 61) of cases.
Out of the 120 initial resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1, and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
The median survival after the first resection was 20 months overall, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After a second resection (n = 14), the median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumors at the time of the initial liver resection, the median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and after R1/2 resection, it was 7 months.
The present results show that the resection of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine liver metastases can indeed offer a prognostic benefit.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences can also benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term outcomes were observed even in situations initially assessed as unfavorable.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained puzzled about the out-of-character act for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large anterior communicating artery aneurysm while in custody.
For the assessment of criminal responsibility, this course of events, in connection with the witnessed behavioral abnormalities shortly before the crime, therefore allows for the possibility of considering a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has proven effective for the elevation and subsequent removal of a dislocated intraocular lens (IOL) in the vitreous body, among other applications.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is floated up and can be repositioned in the anterior eye segment, where it can be refixed, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
The type of contact PFCL has with the IOL is unclear.
Since biotoxicity of PFCL is likely with prolonged intraocular retention, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of the surgery.
A rare case of a solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of a chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year postoperative interval without symptoms.
In the course of further investigations, no clinically-apparable metastases were found.
Considering the cases described so far, the prognosis is still very poor.
Developmental anomalies of the pancreas are due to the embryonic origin of the organ and are caused by a malformation (pancreas divisum) or a malrotation (annular pancreas) of the two structures.
Pancreas divisum and annular pancreas can ultimately only be confirmed through a ductal representation of the pancreatic duct.
In congenital diseases, genetic defects are present, usually involving other organ systems and where the extrapancreatic damage is often the main focus of the disease.
Both developmental anomalies of the pancreas and congenital diseases lead to various morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected using modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
Using the table works of Bärensprung and Hebra, it is demonstrated that, upon closer examination, they also reveal many other medically historically relevant facts.
Approximately 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the newborn period.
We report on unusual findings in late-presented congenital diaphragmatic defects, specifically the association with primary funnel chest and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The diagnostic accuracy of sonography in bacterial coxitis was evaluated.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92), and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined sonographically.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the hip joint surface, and the periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard sectional planes of DEGUM.
An intra-articular space-occupying lesion (synovitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule detachment has been sonographically detected in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis, and the early stage of Perthes disease.
Since joint capsule distension does not show significant differences in individual diseases, differentiation of these diseases is not possible based on the sonogram when there is capsule distension without bony changes.
A bacterial coxitis cannot be reliably distinguished from coxitis of other origins by sonography;
Capsule distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
In case of clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, an immediate diagnostic puncture, if necessary under sonographic control, is required.
Due to additional bony changes alongside the capsular distension, ultrasound can differentiate between epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Morbus Perthes in the condensation and fragmentation stages, as well as bacterial coxitis and coxitis of other origins.
The diagnosis of the rare Gliomatosis cerebri can only be made by considering clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings together.
In both cases, the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri was complicated by unusually high-grade dedifferentiated tumor cells, atypical findings such as contrast agent uptake in MRI, and clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses, and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study, and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized studies are discussed in detail, demonstrating that they are the only way to make statements about causal relationships in an empirical science like medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but rather that good clinical research in this sense primarily depends on careful study planning.
The potential influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has been assessed differently so far.
Above all, the anticoagulant Phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost disregarded in studies.
The present retrospective study was conducted to investigate a potential drug interaction between Phenprocoumon and tricyclic antidepressants.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerosis-related, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenoses were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, in one case a thromboendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with profundaplasty was performed, and in another case, angioplasty with stent implantation of the common iliac artery was carried out.
The technical and clinical success was achieved in all cases.
In an observation period of a median of 23 (7-33) months, there was no occlusion or clinical restenosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenoses represents a minimally invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary: A report about a patient who underwent several years of infertility treatment and became pregnant, even though she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitously present as disease-causing agents.
In the past, Aspergillus flavus was considered to be relatively non-pathogenic for humans.
The case of a 72-year-old patient is described, in whom Aspergillus flavus was detected in the tracheal secretions in the intensive care unit after an aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The conducted serological test methods, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (Author:
Is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies? Monoclonal antibody-coated latex particles were repeatedly negative.
A postmortem Aspergillus test performed using a newer method, the antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
In clinical and radiological findings, there was no evidence of a systemic infection.
The patient passed away before the implementation of antifungal therapy, and the autopsy revealed a disseminated mycosis of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis can be facilitated by the possibility of a more sensitive antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay.
By correctly assessing the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with Amphotericin B should be initiated even after a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
The epidemiological data shows a decline in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in industrialized countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years old, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high perforation rate in young children and elderly people demonstrates the low diagnostic certainty.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow for a clear conclusion on the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
After refractive procedures on the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular image errors (aberrations) can occur, which are not correctable with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal-related visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image errors under clinical conditions would be an important first step towards documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been performed experimentally so far.
Ecke and Hofmann came to the conclusion that comparable stability can be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid methods, and these should be preferred due to the preservation of mobility in the symphysis for the prevention of its ankylosis.
Simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental examinations under gait simulation conditions were used to comparatively test symphysis stabilizations using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension bandings, and PDS bandings.
The symphysis specimens were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 load cycles (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire traction bracing nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, as these methods allowed for symphysis mobility beyond physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, the instability increased due to the cutting of cerclages and bandings into the bone or the breaking of wire cerclages in general until complete failure.
In the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilization, the success of stabilization depended on the primary stability of screw anchorage.
With the primary tendency of the screws to over-rotate, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic load.
In cases of primary stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55,500 load cycles with a load corresponding to half the average body weight.
For clinical application, these results suggest that neither the bridging tension band with wire cerclages nor the PDS banding sufficiently stabilize the ruptured symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If a secure stabilization of the ruptured symphysis can be achieved primarily with the DC plate or the reconstruction plate due to good anchoring of the screws in non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with an "open-book injury" can be mobilized with partial weight-bearing corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been successfully implanted for years.
Due to the distribution of light across multiple focal points, less light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects due to capsular fibrosis may potentially lead to an early deterioration in vision.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumor was initially misdiagnosed as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Only during an anemia investigation carried out 17 months later, a 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected using duodenopancreatectomy.
The re-evaluation of the primary histology led to a revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as a metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient passed away 6 months later due to a stroke.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor disease as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by the thyroid metastasis.
The medical therapy for erectile dysfunction includes the oral and local application of pharmaceuticals.
At the present time, the only approved oral substance with proven effectiveness is Yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha-receptor blocker.
Other oral medications with a central target point are Trazodone and Apomorphine, with Apomorphine showing significantly better results than a placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
For local application, both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous methods are available.
At the present time, Prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely displaced other drugs as the substance used.
Currently, several promising substances with different modes of action and various dosage forms are under development as a therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction.
A form of nonverbal psychotherapy is presented, working with sound, pulsation, and rhythm instruments:
They alter the patient's state of consciousness, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for more severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and near-death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most significant long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is a growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemo-, radiation-, and hormone therapies have led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies grouped under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates usually range between 20 and 40%.
Additionally, 30-40% of patients experience a temporary stabilization of the disease, which can last for years in individual cases.
Mostly, these are results from uncontrolled Phase II studies.
Healings are generally not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%), and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient groups.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy-treated patients compared to non-treated or chemotherapy-treated patients.
A survival advantage is ensured for patients with objective remissions.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at the moment.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of common treatment protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates, and the survival advantage reported by some authors for immunotherapy-treated patients [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The application should generally be carried out within the context of clinical trials.
In a study of 501 participants of both sexes, including 262 men (approximately half aged 44.4 +/- 0.9 and half aged 63.0 +/- 0.9) and 239 women (half aged 44.4 +/- 0.9 and half aged 62.8 +/- 0.8), laboratory indices were calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and correlations with biological age according to Ries were examined.
The calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin, and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are only found in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also show a significant correlation with pre-aging.
Among them are alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides, and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as an incidental finding during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial carcinoma in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum, as well as cytological atypia in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings are likely due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology, and localizations of primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller-type are discussed.
Initially, this procedure was expected to provide advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction, and restoration of proprioception, in addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft. However, the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
A study was conducted on 15 endoscopically and 14 openly operated patients, both preoperatively and 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems were assessed, along with ligament stability (KT-1000), operation duration, and proprioception using the angle reproduction test.
The energy dose of spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the manufacturer of the computed tomography scanner for dental CT was gradually reduced.
A reduction of radiation exposure by 76% was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of the computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the radiation path) at 187.5 mAs and 1-mm layers (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, measurements ranged from 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface).
Length measurements on cut pine specimens were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was between 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by approximately 76% had no influence on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the CT scans reduced by 76% are still on average about 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of an enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectively determined through the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and especially immunohistological techniques for detecting inflammatory changes in the myocardium in patients with the clinical suspicion of dilated cardiomyopathy allows for a subdivision into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response, which can be detected using histological and especially immunohistological techniques.
Only through the combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecular biological techniques was it possible to perform a subgroup analysis regarding the frequency of detecting enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative) osteomyelitis, there is bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of non-bacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which, in contrast to the others, preferentially manifests on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis that we treated from 1978-1996, we present 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis as case studies.
In differential diagnosis, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered despite its rare occurrence, as it is - after biopsy diagnosis confirmation - a domain of conservative, drug therapy.
The infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medication and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors relies on the four pillars of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.
In the study, the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in optimizing chemotherapy protocols is examined using a literature analysis and focusing on three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses, as well as well-designed clinical studies, can enable progress in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Morbus Castleman (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) refers to a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease pattern from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a highly potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.
In this study, we present the in-vitro and in-vivo results from our research on Paclitaxel.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in-vivo application.
The evidence of Paclitaxel's effect on the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall was demonstrated through staining of the cytoskeleton and electron microscopy.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and an increase in vessel diameter compared to balloon-dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contraction force was demonstrated after Paclitaxel administration.
In addition to age-related accumulation of waste products between the cytoplasmic and basal membrane of RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), various manifestations of early and late AMD, such as drusen, choroidal neovascularizations, and pigment epithelial detachments, show a splitting of Bruch's membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus can be detected.
Recent studies show that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis result from disrupted spinal growth.
Determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the lesion site and type of tendon affection in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnostics.
For the majority of common dermatoses, suitable naturally occurring animal models are lacking.
The transgenic technology, established in the 1980s, closes this gap.
Initially, it was an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years, it has also made its way into clinically oriented, specific dermatological basic research.
With it, it became possible to simulate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses in the murine model and gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice generated in this way can be used for studies of the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The availability of animal models for human dermatoses also allows for targeted research on experimental therapies, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication against MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic questions, such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and complaints inside the knee, can be better examined by MRI than with other radiological methods.
MRI can directly affect artificial heart valve carriers in three ways:
1) Movement and displacement of the valve prosthesis, 2) Heating, and 3) Induction of arrhythmias by electrical currents, and indirectly through distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI for artificial heart valve carriers seems insufficient.
Therefore, in 1998 a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI for their respective valve prostheses.
Some companies based their statements on non-transparent investigations or shifted responsibility to the doctor performing the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances, and prerequisites for MRI safety standards for artificial heart valve carriers is provided.
In an experimental study, 10 pigs with an average body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg were subjected to an intravenous CO2 or Argon embolism with 10, 20, and 30 ml of gas.
In the Argon group (n = 5), two animals died after receiving a 20 ml and 30 ml bolus injection, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administering a 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), none of the animals died nor was resuscitation required.
Insoluble gases like argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma annulare in the context of known diabetic metabolism.
Additionally, there was kidney insufficiency, which led us to refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed a balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole-body baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and a significant improvement of the skin condition on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Through balneophotochemotherapy, not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes can be therapeutically influenced.
Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a lesser-known infectious disease in Germany.
Only a few years ago, the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was isolated.
In the majority of cases, a typical clinical picture is found with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less frequently, there are additional organ manifestations.
We report on a 47-year-old patient who developed reactive spondyloarthritis with synovitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the medium and large joints, and inflammatory lumbar pain after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were time-limited and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint involvement in the context of KKK have been described.
Since the prevalence of Bartonella henselae infection in cats in Europe is high, it could be a more common cause of joint complaints than previously assumed.
The diagnosis of KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Through continuous therapy optimization in recent years, the prognosis for Hodgkin's disease has significantly improved.
This improvement in overall survival, however, also leads to an increase in a variety of possible long-term complications, of which the treating physician must be aware.
Due to often persistent fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism, and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the mostly young patients are significantly affected in their quality of life.
Additionally, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful therapy poses a significant problem.
Starting from attachment styles as defined patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations, and readiness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
The main goal in 1990 was to operationalize these patterns in the sense of their original definition, i.e., as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "secure", "avoidant", and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on factor-analytical results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatient patients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters, which can be interpreted as attachment styles:
"secure", two variants of "insecure-ambivalent" ("closed off" and "clingy") and two variants of "insecure-avoidant" ("closed off" and "cooperative").
The discriminant analysis of these clusters resulted in discriminant functions similar to those of Collins and Read (1990) as well as Ainsworth et al.
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive inner ear hearing loss, fluctuating dizziness, and the simultaneous radiological detection of a contrast-enhancing mass in the inner auditory canal strengthen the suspicion of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a known history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case report shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellopontine angle, which manifested itself with peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and initially no central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of a lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial palsy that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital headaches radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious finding constellation, as described in our case, must challenge to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification despite the presence of leading symptoms.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellopontine angle is considered a rarity.
Additional therapy options available to the gynecologist in practice, clinic, and rehabilitation include balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a natural healing method.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures are primarily to be used as supplementary measures, depending on the indication.
Only in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they particularly suitable for pain reduction and positive tissue influence as primary measures.
The conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks to obtain a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent sensitivity testing.
It takes seven to eight weeks for a negative culture result to be reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps using new methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these currently do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The globally alarming epidemiological situation of the infection risk for tuberculosis leaves no doubt that the further development of methods is necessary, which allow for the detection, differentiation, and testing of mycobacteria for their sensitivity to antibiotics with high sensitivity and specificity in the shortest possible time.
In a prospective randomized study, a non-joint-bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the treatment of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the care provided by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated breast milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Due to its favorable composition, the milk of donors who have had premature children themselves is preferred for very immature preterm infants.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day facilities.
The widespread presence of these facilities contrasts with the general lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and their operations.
In the present study, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptoms, and the visitors' perspective were collected.
Almost all visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with an average moderate severity.
Two-thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
Visitors mentioned the contact with other people and the daily structure as positive aspects of the facilities.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
The visitors of TSn were on average younger and showed higher values in the BPRS subscale Anergia.
By the way, the visitors of the two institutions hardly differed in the examined characteristics.
The results suggest that both institutions actually provide care for chronically mentally ill patients with poor social integration, which is the purpose for which they were designed.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Boundaries and consequences of the results will be addressed.
Functional brain examinations were long only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
By using fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications, and special post-processing methods, it has become possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging sequences, information about tissue perfusion, microcirculation, and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be obtained using special models, some of which are derived from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, while the macrovasculature can be temporally resolved using MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic examinations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be detected multidimensionally, and metabolic processes can be observed over time.
Advantages of MRI include low invasiveness, the ability to display data in three dimensions, and the possibility of repeating the examination without radiation exposure.
The clinically applicable functional methods are described and their use in neuroradiology is discussed, also in terms of their value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy decision-making, therapy planning, and therapy monitoring.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are capable of sensitively detecting pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to place health protection as high as possible in the awareness of all countries in the European region, especially in the face of constant political and economic change.
Harmful environmental factors should be combated internationally through concrete measures or better yet, prevented proactively.
An essential prerequisite is the agreement on international standards in the fields of environment and health, as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It is essential to ensure that governments and their respective populations develop a shared understanding of the important environmental health issues.
To ensure the necessary smooth flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO Center for Information and Communication in the field of Environment and Health" (WHO-Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health) at the Robert Koch Institute in the summer of 1997, with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn.
A case is reported of a 30-year-old patient who experienced a right-sided amaurosis fugax along with a simultaneous frontobasal fracture after a fall.
Using CT and MR angiography, a closure of the ophthalmic artery due to a dissection of the internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis was identified as the cause.
No further neurological deficits were present, as sufficient blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured through the cerebral arterial circle.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically, and therapeutically if necessary.
Suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires immediate investigation using appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or aortography.
In the case presented here, an echocardiographic suspicion of aortic dissection was raised in an asymptomatic patient.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other imaging techniques to diagnose the presence of a house triage of the aneurysmatically enlarged thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out an aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital due to acute chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, and signs of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In further clarification using echocardiography, a ruptured sinus Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp with a left-to-right shunt into the right atrium was identified as the cause in a non-invasive manner.
The cardiac surgery was performed without complications while preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, the right heart sections were echocardiographically normal in width, and no shunt could be detected in the color Doppler.
An acute cardiac insufficiency can also be a consequence of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
Through echocardiography and specifically through transesophageal echocardiography, a precise diagnosis could be made noninvasively.
Characteristics of Nager Syndrome include mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
The mandibular hypoplasia can lead to airway obstructions, especially in infancy, due to the tongue's contact with the posterior pharyngeal wall.
We present a patient with Nager Syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for persistent dyspnea over 5 months.
After the soft tissues were pre-stretched through an extension treatment, a mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic results are good.
Airway obstructions and dyspnea were no longer observed after the completion of therapy.
Successful thromboendarterectomy (TEA) of the internal carotid artery leads to improved perfusion in the area supplied by this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors regarding the diagnostic-therapeutic approach in the treatment of a specific medical case using modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in clinical practice is largely defined, but an adequate remuneration for this independent medical service is still unclear.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on visual acuity.
There is no longer any doubt today that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct result of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old patient who has suffered for years from a progressive effluvium in psoriasis lesions on the scalp.
Histologically, there were strand-like fibroses instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles and were characteristic of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal-pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
The knowledge of this possible relationship is significant in that consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably the development of scarring.
A reduced production of growth hormones (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
The treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms, including the number of main pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
The hypothesis is presented that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of increased cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin, leading to reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SIB).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of traditional neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist Risperidone effectively reduced self-injurious behavior in the long term.
The aim of the present study was to create an osteoporosis animal model using ovariectomy.
Before and after the ovariectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovariectomy was observed in both the upper and lower jaw.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were examined and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the bleeding were diverse:
In addition to vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from eroded subchondral vessels in areas of severe chondromalacia.
The surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy, yielded good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by European adders (Vipera berus).
The adder injects a venom containing various enzymes and hemorrhagic as well as neurotoxic factors.
Viper bites in children can be mild in symptoms, but can also cause severe poisoning.
Additionally, pathological findings can be displayed extensively in their environment.
The transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapist not present during the examination and the monitoring of a finding, e.g., a tumor, during therapy, are significantly improved.
Viruses have also become more mobile due to the increasing global human travel speed and activity.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in increasingly shorter periods of time.
In this study, four case examples are used to examine the factors that can influence an early or late timing of the initial diagnosis of dementia.
In all our cases, we have determined the indication for surgery.
The perforation site was primarily sutured and extensively rinsed and drained in each case.
In 2 cases, the suture line was additionally secured with fibrin glue or an omentum plasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Based on these findings and after evaluating the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified:
In case of securing a perforation in the early stage, definitive surgical intervention is indicated.
Even in cases of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, an attempt should be made to close the perforation site with sutures.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resizing procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high surgical risk.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidney, Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that rarely have larger fat-containing components.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which, due to a large lipomatous component with internal calcifications, could have also been a teratoma according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in various cross-sectional imaging techniques are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations were correlated in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often mistaken for a malignancy.
Due to the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be considered early in differential diagnostic considerations.
The report is about a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month medical history, bloody-purulent expectoration, and significant weight loss, who was referred to us under suspicion of a thoracic sarcoma.
Only through a diagnostic detour could the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis be made.
The trigger for this was an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms quickly regressed and ultimately led to the patient's recovery.
In the differential diagnostic clarification of thoracic space-occupying lesions, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors, as well as germ cell tumors, bronchoscopy is an important part of the diagnostics.
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver represent a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient is described, in whom the percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy.
Instead, the adjustable "banding" of the liver artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After a mini-laparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the liver artery and an adapted constriction of the liver artery was performed using the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced, and heart failure was treated.
The described technique thus represents an alternative to the ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis in biopsies of benign diseases in our own study material has been made in 3% of cases over 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis occurs in relation to the number of births today in about 1%, the different forms of non-puerperal mastitis have come to the forefront both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of currently diagnosable mastitis cases are chronic granulomatous forms with a broad spectrum of causes.
Only a small part is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis, or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis that occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine, and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and when suspecting an infectious mastitis, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be performed on fresh material.
An infectious colitis caused by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile primarily occurs in immunocompromised or antibiotic-treated patients.
We report on 2 boys aged 5 and 14 with Clostridium difficile-induced colitis, without the mentioned preconditions or a specific underlying disease.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Newer prospective studies show that the application of a corresponding protocol leads to an earlier start of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily screening of respiratory function and spontaneous breathing trials are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
As soon as the condition and ability for spontaneous breathing are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing trial.
A gradual withdrawal of mechanical ventilation can be attempted in patients for whom spontaneous breathing trials have been unsuccessful.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used for discontinuing mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of weaning success, and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
The secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and surgical outcomes in 30 patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (CLP) deformities.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was performed by measuring standardized nasal grid photos and the lateral long-distance X-ray image.
In the process, deviations in nasal symmetry, nasal width, and the attachment line of the nasal wings from the ideal shape were determined.
The assessment of the nasal profile was carried out by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angles, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal, and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate air permeability.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined, and the flow of the gap and non-gap sides were compared.
The examinations were conducted immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nostril inclination are achieved.
A significant improvement in the sharp nasofacial angle and the low-set nasal wing was not achieved.
Through the intervention, the overall flow was increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the gap and non-gap sides was achieved.
The applied examination methods allow for the objective assessment of aesthetically and functionally relevant findings, thus serving as quality control.
Studies and reports on incidents following manual therapy of the spine from the years 1989-1996 were examined.
In the literature, there are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies on complications that have occurred in connection with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice for the assessment of ankle disorders.
Conventional MRI can reliably display normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stages of injury, however, the joint fluid often necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments is often lacking.
In these cases, MR arthrography should be performed, as the intra-articular contrast medium application distends the joint space with improved distinguishability of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in assessing the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, as in cases of unstable lesions, a contrast agent can more easily show the flushing of the dissected tissue.
Finally, MR arthrography improves the detection of intra-articular loose bodies due to its high contrast and joint distension, which often require surgical treatment.
The MR arthrography, although invasive, provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle as well as various ankle diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment should be the social reintegration of the person, ideally returning to the state before the emergency occurred.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated in a rural area due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac origin.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of a trunk varicosis of the V. saphena magna and/or parva type.
Through ascension, thrombus migration can occur into the deep venous system via the openings of the main veins in the groin and popliteal fossa or through insufficient perforating veins, which can lead to the complication of a pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the main veins without involvement of the junctions of the great and/or small saphenous veins and the deep venous system.
In Type IV, the thrombus migrates trans-fascially through insufficient perforating veins into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicose veins are surgically treated only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes the crossectomy, the exstirpation of the main vein through separate incisions, the exhairese of all varicose branches, and the ligation of insufficient perforating veins.
In Type III, thrombectomy through the V. saphena magna and/or parva opening takes precedence over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, asymptomatic thickening of the lateral finger parts and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
From a formal pathogenetic perspective, the disease is based on a benign fibromatosis.
Based on personal observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of compulsive behaviors appear to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms include irritability, restlessness, confusion, impaired consciousness, seizures, or focal neurological deficits.
We report on a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute brain-organic psychosyndrome with progressive consciousness disturbance leading to coma.
The initial cranial computed tomography showed a discrete, general brain swelling, which regressed independently of the clinical deterioration.
The cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
In the transcranial Doppler sonography, generalized flow velocity increases were found (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides, as well as A. basilaris).
The causal relationship between increased flow velocity and impaired consciousness is likely supported by the observation that clinical improvement occurred in parallel with the regression of increased flow velocity.
Pathophysiologically, a disturbed prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV, and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted approach.
Although the gold standard for treating cruciate ligament injuries is replacement plastic, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement in adolescents is an excellent option.
We report on the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
This was preceded by a blunt thoracic trauma in the context of a traffic accident.
The vascular injury could not be diagnosed through a computed tomography (CT) scan.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, an angiography should be performed if possible to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are significantly more detailed than the official German guidelines and show considerable differences in some areas.
With this brief presentation of American guidelines, the clinician should be provided with a well-founded decision-making aid for their own practical work regarding many everyday, but by no means trivial, problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent a prolonged therapy with Iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgKGxmin over a 6-day titration phase.
The therapy led to an improvement in inflammation parameters, lung function, especially diffusion capacity, and the pronounced peripheral circulation disorder.
The elbow joint is considered the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional perspective due to its central location.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and limited mobility, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today, there is hardly any doubt that in the majority of cases, a primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as essential for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical peculiarities of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current state of which is presented in this work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulations by the patient on subcutaneous electrode sections that can be felt through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We introduce a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode paths and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This medication is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
In the present overview, the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil are presented, as well as the current experiences with this drug in dermatology summarized.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, today's 3D technology offers the possibility to analyze structures in individual steps with tomographic precision.
From the electronic storage, image layers that cannot be displayed using conventional technology can be reconstructed without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes additionally allow a three-dimensional representation of stored structures.
With these various display options and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the detailed diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paresthesias, burning pain in the legs occurred as a result of the accidental infusion, accompanied by motor and sensory innervation failure up to segment TH 11. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications like the one described usually result from errors, the occurrence of which cannot be ruled out, but can be made less likely through appropriate measures.
Such measures include color-coding of lines, filters, and infusion solutions, as well as the use of syringe pumps with a larger medication reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The examination of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experiences show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology so far.
In view of a fundamental evaluation of the influence of alveolar ridge height and width, an analysis of 95 edentulous bony maxillae from collections was initially carried out, which were standardized, measured, and classified.
For 4 implant types (minimum length of 10 mm), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and evaluated differentiated by implant type, cross-sectional position, and atrophy class.
Similarly, in the clinical study part, 24 consecutive implant patients with an edentulous upper jaw were treated.
Implant insertion in the cadaver jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but with sufficient jaw height, it was expected in an additional 4.5%.
Implant length reductions were additionally necessary in 6% of cases.
Dependencies existed mainly in relation to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered significantly more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not possible in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, and in 2 cases, a transversely narrow alveolar ridge was only discovered during surgery despite sufficient height.
The results allow for the quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimensions.
This meaning primarily lies in the bone height, although even with sufficient height, reductions in implant length are often necessary.
However, both on the cadaver jaw (12% of cuts with expected implantability) and on the patient (8%), there remain alveolar ridge profiles for which the sole height measurement gives false proportions and possibly an accurately planned surgical procedure must be aborted.
The complexity and cost of implantological rehabilitation and the consequences of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require fundamentally extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes and not morphological changes.
Since tumors exhibit increased glycolysis, they can be detected using radioactively labeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven successful in various tumor entities.
In this study, PET was investigated for lymph node staging of bladder cancer.
In 64 patients, a preoperative PET scan of the pelvis was performed after intravenous injection of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), allowing the PET findings to be compared with the histological findings of the surgical specimen after classical operative lymph node staging.
During lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly identified in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86%, and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than the traditional staging methods, such as CT and MRI.
In a study of 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal total immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, a mucosa-preserving paranasal sinus surgery is indicated, but this alone cannot achieve the desired success in this disease pattern.
An immunoglobulin subclass deficiency is considered an indicator of a disrupted immune system.
Transitions to severe immunodeficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk and the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological findings led to the diagnosis of Lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Under treatment with Acitretin, there was a significant reduction in lesions.
The Lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - particularly the "Blaschkitis of adults" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urinary continence after rectal resections has increased since nerve-sparing preparation and complete excision of the mesorectum have become more widespread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are found in the literature between 25 and 67%.
Materials and Methods:
On 10 cadavers and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic specimens, the autonomous nerve fibers of the pelvis were demonstrated.
Their spatial relationship and possible damage sites were demonstrated and photo-documented during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomous nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with only minor interindividual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense fiber network around the trunk of the A. mesenterica inferior (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated through the standard surgical approach.
The nomenclature of the fasciae and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly defined in the literature.
A high removal of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
The close spatial relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes sharp dissection under direct vision essential.
Fascia and nerves can be used as guiding structures during dissection.
5. The selective preservation of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible through the standard surgical access.
The early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is significant for prognosis and crucial for treatment planning.
In a prospective study from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and lip were panendoscopically staged to determine whether early diagnosis of simultaneous second carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract is possible using this method.
The panendoscopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by the rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by the endoscopic examination of the naso-, oro-, and hypopharynx.
The conclusion was the microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous secondary cancers was 8.4%.
Precancerous lesions could also be diagnosed using panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral, Maxillofacial, and Facial Surgery, as well as the Regensburg Tumor Center (1993-1997), confirm the high proportion of second cancers in patients with a primary tumor in the "head and neck area."
Due to the good experiences so far and the uncomplicated course, this examination apparently does not pose any additional risk to patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's chorea can pose significant problems, especially at the beginning of the disease, due to the high variability of the clinical picture.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's chorea, in whom the psychopathological changes formed the main symptomatology for over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
Exceptional and thus significantly responsible for the misdiagnosis were the very early onset of the disease and the noticeable advancement of the onset of the disease compared to other affected family members.
The phenomenon of the earlier onset of the disease in the case of transmission of the mutated gene from the father is well documented in the literature.
In differential diagnosis, the key factors were the attention to the initially subtle abnormalities in the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed collection of family medical history.
A dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focuses:
As climate therapy, as (balneo-) phototherapy, or within a psychosomatic context.
Since certain patient groups benefit differently from this, indications for psychosomatic treatment are being developed:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a psychological disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological origin or with psychological involvement, when depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress, or psychotherapy motivation are present.
In case of problems in coping with the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant skin neoplasms, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, the importance of orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses for functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle joint will be discussed.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature are explained in relation to joint stabilization, injury prevention, and influence on athletic performance as well as proprioceptive abilities.
The present study deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene acetabular cups of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion cause varying degrees of shape changes in polyethylene.
The amount of wear can be detected by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first years after surgery, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
It stabilizes after about 5 years at values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable in terms of prosthesis loosening.
In this study, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the marking wire of the acetabulum for a total of 369 hip prostheses, and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average runtime of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was only achieved in 71% (n = 260) of cases (runtime 61.5 months).
The sliding pairing of polyethylene and ceramic reduces wear by half compared to the pairing of polyethylene and metal.
For younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If there is an indication for performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who are unable to give consent, the approval of the caregiver is required for the implementation of the treatment.
The Hamburg District Court, referring to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, had assumed a justified risk of long-lasting health damage and had affirmed the need for approval.
However, when considering contraindications, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective treatment for depression and schizophrenic psychoses.
The application of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesias occur very rarely and in a severity that can be neglected considering the risks posed by the underlying disease.
In the authors' opinion, a guardianship court approval requirement within the framework of the Care Act should be negated.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance, among other things, by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine.
The in-vitro contracture test (IVCT) following the protocol of the European MH Group represents the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH susceptibility due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a strong correlation between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and MH susceptibility.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene was detected in an individual from a large family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the correlation with the IVCT was of interest.
The ultrasonic diagnosis of malignant lymphomas in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system diseases in children appear relatively uniform in ultrasound:
Initially, there are lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disturbances in the normal echo texture, usually in the form of hypoechoic lesions.
In parenchymal organs, essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed sonographically:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular, and the "bulky type."
A successful therapy can be seen in the ultrasound by the normalization of lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity, and the regression of tumor- or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic indications result from the topographical distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, to a certain extent, from the echogenicity and the blood flow conditions that can be analyzed using Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
Background and research question.
In the transient acantholytic dermatosis first described by Grover in 1970, clinically, there are usually itching, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles predominantly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically, acantholysis is typical.
With the cause still unclear to this day, factors such as light, sweating, and heat are being discussed as potential triggers.
