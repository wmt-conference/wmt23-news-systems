Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early exit from the World Cup in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach caused anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New beet signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action “Geesthacht blüht auf” also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. “Geesthacht blossoms” is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been put into the ground since 2015. Objective: Large-scale flowering islands are to be created in the Geesthacht urban area, where insects can find food at all times. “If the weather is favorable, the bees fly out in January to look for food,” says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the project does not only remain an action of conservationists and the environmental department of the city, but also extends into the private gardens, explanatory boards are placed repeatedly on the plants. So far, about 50 signs have been erected. Passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming here so beautifully. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant specifically at home.
The season started at the Wildhasel in the first week of January
More recent are shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing just the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been marked with further signs. “The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow to between two meters high and three meters wide,” it says among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bed plants that are now showing flowers. The season started at Wildhasel in the first week of January. It blooms particularly lushly on the topping path along the climb, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: “Steppen keeps me young”
Munich - Dance-Gott Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to Munich’s Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday in the “Mandolin Motion Show Academy” at 3 pm, three ladies meet for a brisk tap dance - together they are unbelievable 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. “Dancing and taping is my life, without which I cannot imagine.”
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing legs.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. “I spent my life dancing, acting and singing.”
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the tap dancer’s circle. She says: “We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl.”
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, each more durable than the original wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, dancing creates rhythmic sounds that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeial tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance, where the tops of the shoes are nailed to create a sound that can be heard while dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. “We are a big family, with us big and small, old and young are welcome.”
And what is the recipe for such a long life? “I am kept young by exercise”, the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: “Sport, healthy food and no alcohol”.
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalization progresses, some people’s appetite for analog is growing again
According to DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick, the speed with which our daily lives went digital meant that we had little time to draw up rules for dealing with it and adapt our methods of communication and working to it.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, you had three choices. You could be one of the lucky six percent who had a private line. Or you could be one of those who had someone from that exclusive group in the neighborhood who could make a phone call to the relative for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you could go to a phone booth. Never forgetting the smell of the plastic phone and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person’s face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What’s next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed the former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean has been one of the President’s advisers.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned in surprise. The pro-European leader was under intense pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently hostility from pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her “enormous sacrifice”.
Moldova borders Ukraine and is suffering the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is running at over 40% and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones, with the support of the Kremlin, have become more popular.
These were the costumes of celebrities
2023 will be celebrated again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn’t let themselves be asked for long.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria’s Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children’s hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and Mrs Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely taken off: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, pulls it into space.
Landtag President Ilse Aigner looked for no less than “Mama Bavaria” as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria’s Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob der Baumeister alias Construction Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria’s golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at Carnival: Bavaria’s Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economics Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district councillor of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be absent.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD faction leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal became the leader of the FDP faction, Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he will certainly talk more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the group in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was out as a mime. At his side is Mrs Andrea.
If politics no longer works, he can at least conjure up magic. Nuremberg’s OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flying like a bee: Bavaria’s Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists by the Franconian crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not missing. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Bold eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to catch up with fellow countryman Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway’s mixed relay team was already enough to defend the title successfully.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. Bö is once again the clear favorite in the pursuit. His running form is superb, so he can easily compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent.
In the meantime, nothing came together again at Doll. After the routine rider had lost all chances of a medal in the opener with a penalty lap in the mixed relay and only finished sixth, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty rounds already in recumbent shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he won surprisingly with a margin of 0.7 seconds over Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who have been on the podium so far this winter. The eighth-place finisher from Beijing was silent after his poor performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees finished 19th and second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: “We must stand up for democracy”
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, focuses on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit to Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
“The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test,” Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the heart of our strength.” Referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: “Brazil has isolated itself for four years.”
The left-wing politician Lula defeated Bolsonaro in a runoff in late October. On January 1, Lula took office. The transition of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court, and the seat of government in the capital, Brasilia, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grimly reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently broke into Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro in the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. “His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,” Lula said. “Sounds familiar,” Biden replied, an obvious reference to his predecessor, Trump.
Brief note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF search posters? They showed the members of the Red Army faction who had been cleared to denounce and shoot down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let’s say bourgeois democracy, let’s say late capitalist society. (Here’s nothing about the really dangerous in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which usually goes after Raudis in the S-Bahn or Onanists in the Park, is publishing a new edition with Putin’s friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong, there are perhaps more “Russian friends” than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that’s not the point, it’s: Mrs. Wagenknecht is ranked 1 to 5 (!), followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Well, I don’t know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If I did, it’s about time. We’ve reached the level we know where there’s nothing below it.
And by now, dialectically speaking, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need to differentiate here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler’s lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the Bild newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: “I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has applied to the competent court for the annulment of his civil partnership. I do not comment on the details.”
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, rumors of separation had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the house together in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor killed
A memorial center was established in 1999 in the ruined village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have survived. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hebras fought for freedom and defended France’s values, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had worked for Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve position for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: It is not unusual for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In the summer 300 motorcycles a day roar the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some of them come right back.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be “absolutely” necessary in the fight against high inflation. “Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening-up of China could also provide a temporary boost to prices,” Sewing told the German newspaper “Welt am Sonntag”.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the euro area now stands at 3.0%. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make credit more expensive. This can dampen demand, thus counteracting high inflation rates. Higher borrowing rates can also cause investment to be postponed, thus weakening economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro countries such as Italy. “The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,” said Sewing. “Of course we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not deter the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area at a rate of inflation of 2 percent over the medium term. This target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier.
Higher inflation reduces the purchasing power of consumers because they can afford less for one euro. Sharply rising energy prices, which drive inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will “sooner or later collapse,” warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). “I see this as the biggest threat to the German economy at the moment. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the “Germany’s pace” declared by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) on infrastructure projects. “There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this, and it may also be a bit more controversial,” he told Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Stuttgart. He hoped that the end result would be a set of rules which would not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals which were commissioned around the turn of the year - but not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gas supply gap due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. On the occasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new “Germany’s pace”. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated a speeding-up of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
“First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes to it. But this should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in a neighbor’s garden against his will,” Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what society thinks is right and wrong.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and failed. “We should reconsider whether the previous approach was the right one. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.”
In view of the many outstanding tasks, such as the extension of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. “As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the extension and it should be as green as possible.”
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
Following an announced change of boss at Bayer, the chemical trade union IG BCE warns against a break-up of the group. “From the employees’ point of view, Bayer’s three pillars are perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future,” Francesco Grioli, member of the union’s board of directors and Bayer’s supervisory board, told the “Rheinische Post” (Saturday issue).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, consumer health with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. “The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk-spreading and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism.”
The background is the change of chief executive of the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. Controversial chief Werner Baumann will vacate his position this summer. Bill Anderson, the former chief executive of Swiss rival Roche, is due to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been the subject of criticism. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion, completed in 2018, is a blow to the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had caught up in expensive litigation over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer’s stock had been in the doldrums for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to approve the CEO’s discharge at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors have exerted pressure. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, have joined in. Bluebell is pushing for a corporate split, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an undisclosed stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off “of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company’s value,” Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told “Rheinische Post”. On the other hand, he does not consider a split-off of the far larger agricultural sector Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands to protest against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are protesting in the streets against a government plan. Hundreds of thousands are planning to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron’s planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the center-right government’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people took part in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France work longer than they do until they reach the age of 62, if they have not paid long enough for a pay-off pension by the time they reach the age limit. In many demanding jobs, people could hardly work longer, argue opponents of the reform. Employees also wanted to enjoy their well-earned pensions and not to wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension funds
Macron justifies the reform on the grounds of a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population ages, workers will have to pay for an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. To keep the pension level stable, the population will have to work a little more. Critics question the government’s calculations and claim that the government must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, the government does not only want to tighten the retirement age. The increase in the length of time required for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be speeded up. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to be raised to around EUR 1200.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron’s most important plans. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, with massive protests and strikes already taking place. Presidents before Macron have pursued reforms of France’s pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were all certain.
Since Macron’s camp no longer has an absolute majority in Parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. But some lawmakers - even from Macron’s faction - still have reservations. Even greater than fear of a close vote, Macron is likely to worry about crippling strikes at the moment. Before Saturday’s renewed demonstrations, the president said he could count on the organizers’ sense of responsibility to ensure that they were calm and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A mighty area of high pressure lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. “When looking at the weather maps, a mighty high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye,” explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. “Although this high will shift a little to the east in the course of the next week, it will still determine the weather in Germany.”
However, calm, high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. “Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands gloomy high fog for days on end, while in the high altitudes of the low mountains there is pure sun.”
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, there may also be some rain, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it remains cloudy or foggy. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, in the vicinity of the Rhine around 10 degrees Celsius.
“On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high nebula again and will be able to dissolve it more and more throughout the day,” says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, the sun is expected all day long, while elsewhere it will have to fight through the high nebula blanket. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine about 11 degrees, on the other hand only about 3 degrees in the perennial grey in the southeast. In addition, there are weak winds from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may again be only a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog dissolution. In highlands, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the weather is forecast to be sunny all day. Temperatures rise to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator quarrels: No World Cup medal for Goggia again
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her retirement in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
“I’m sad because I didn’t perform as well as I can,” the Italian told ZDF after she set up a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old just avoided what could have been a serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill competitor in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races in this discipline. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. But Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d’Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“I actually thought I was good. It was about hundredths of a second,” said Goggia after the surprise victory of Swiss rider Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. “I’m disappointed. I gave everything. But that’s life.” Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: “But they’re not.”
Missing girl in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since 10 February.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information on her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the release of a photo, the police in Berlin are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. Twelve-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school with other children on the way to the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 on 10 February 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of German and local language.
Description of person: slim shape

Selenskyy and Minister against Russia’s participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. Sports politicians from 35 nations have stepped up the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by calling for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics.
It was agreed in a joint telephone conference to draft a declaration to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
“We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues,” said Minister Yurgita Siugzdiniene.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, UK Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. “And I have made the UK’s position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue.”
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy protested against the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials. “While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” Selenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Ultimately, because of Russia’s aggressive war, even a neutral flag soaked in blood and cannot be worn.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also regards Belarus as a party to the war, because it provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyy called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which “has unfortunately lost its honesty.”
The occasion of the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would not allow Russian and Belarusian sportsmen to compete in Paris. “In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC’s efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go,” said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior in response to dpa’s request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) said at the end of January: “Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum.” Russia, on the other hand, insists that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sporting competitions. However, the IOC wants athletes from both countries to return to the international sporting scene under a neutral flag, provided they make a clear commitment to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently declared that expulsion “on account of a passport or place of birth” would violate the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk where it happens
“Hey, horny ass!” whistling after the fool in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting salacious slogans: all of this falls under the term “catcalling.” Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow’s tank stock severely depleted
Half of vehicles lost? US sees Moscow’s tank stock severely depleted
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. This is called “half of the main stock.”
The US Defense Department estimates that the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. “Presumably half of the main stock of tanks” in the Russian army has been “destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine,” said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security at the U.S. Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander gave no further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to the U.S. estimate.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kyiv to deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. “As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks,” said Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. “It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of different types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks.”
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more geared to the needs of the armed forces. This allows individual industries, for example, to be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Fuss about the filling of posts at the Army
The post that Christian Ortner, former director of the Military History Museum (HGM), will hold in the future, was not advertised. Herwig Jedlaucnik, the Academy’s staff representative, suspects corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the course of action.
A call for tenders was not necessary because the appointment was made to a job vacant so far, said the minister. She did not want to comment on “speculations of a freelance employee representative”. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticizing the museum’s handling of Austria’s military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner’s point of view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner’s suitability in terms of content. Ortner is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands information from Tanner about the “unusual ordering procedure”. The decision is due to the “appearance of a poster chess”, says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP remains “up to its neck in the corruption swamp”, said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defence. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel at cost
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia’s carnival stronghold of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival procession. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the estimated total cost of the move.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The “joyful people’s train” in Cottbus, again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannian carnival either.
In spite of the increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein’s carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade. “We are going through with our event,” says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here too the financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors are not found, or if the existing ones donate even more, reserves will have to be tampered with - “this is not possible every year”. The current deficit is around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: there is a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnachtszug Association. Luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough supply this time. However, it is already certain that the move will become more expensive. Twice as many staff were needed for security as in 2020.
Those on the Rose Monday train in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than in the past. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don’t have as much with them. Camels or not, the number of visitors is likely to be large: “I believe that if it doesn’t rain from buckets that day, then we can certainly expect an increased number of people,” says the Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. “This is due to the fact that there hasn’t been a regular Rose Monday train for two years. There is nothing to replace the train, of course.”
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally “deficit”, this is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
The Ukrainians are not regarded as drinking-proof for nothing. There are local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every time I discover German beer here, not Kulmbacher, but other large-scale breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I do not see much difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They mainly burn it in the villages themselves. They call it samargon. Nobody knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80% in five years. Well, here, too, you can see how little one can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with this. But that only applies if they go on sale in large numbers. That is probably the case.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: “Match luck on our side”
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work, you will find great places to do so in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-lighting for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot “Flocke”
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medals at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range had actually fallen. “I had to get the results on my mobile phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the clouds of fog that repeatedly dragged into the stadium, which severely impaired the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nonetheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: “Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me,” he revealed. He also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: “The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. This is also what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have worked here since the World Cup was awarded.” In terms of sustainability, the location is now “one step ahead” of many others and is therefore “safe for the coming years and even decades.”
Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again escaped the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his faultless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick’s triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed race on Wednesday, the Black Forest driver dropped five discs this time and disappeared into the cabin as 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had entered the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested that status in spite of the difficult visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of a good one; they each landed on the edge of the windows and still fell. The 29-year-old enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: “It’s the best feeling to be here with him,” said the world champion: “We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes.”
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women’s race, however, Germany’s hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. “If you start with number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one,” said sporting director Felix Bitterling. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 hrs/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych doesn’t like “swarm of bees” on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee’s ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany’s referees want to “consistently punish” unsportsmanlike behaviour. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model.
The top German referee Felix Brych has noticed negative tendencies in the interaction on the pitch. “I think there are new behaviors on the part of the players who surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to force him into the review area,” the 47-year-old told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. “We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this - and we will also sanction it.”
Recently, two coaches had also been dismissed. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg coach Christian Streich received yellow red in the league defeat in Dortmund. “The coach’s behavior also falls into the field of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the attitude towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanship consistently,” said Brych.
DFB refereeing chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that the co-operation between coaches and impartialists was generally good. “Overall, the relationship is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned has to live with that. It shouldn’t be anything earth-shattering,” Fröhlich told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
“Emotionality may well lead to conflicts during the game. But if emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have sorted things out afterwards. “It would only be important if a rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior is simply out of place,” said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions on another level. “Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior,” said Fröhlich. “Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying discussion with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful.”
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometer cross-country race of Norwegian Jens Lauraas Oftebro ahead of Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes are not competing in the best line-up in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not among them. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in Planica, Slovenia. “We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course the team feels that,” said German coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end crash on A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes leading to Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage in the Marler Sculpture Museum
Created the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Sculpturenmuseum. There are some extras for the finale.
The closing of the exhibition “Wandgebunden” will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transition quarter of the Marler Sculpturenmuseum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. Two large-format murals will attract the attention in three exhibition rooms.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the artworks disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing ceremony, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. With the help of numerous illustrations, she presents the peculiarities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting in the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching post-war art as well as art and institutional history in Germany, most recently with Sebastian Freytag on Kunst am Bau in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator’s guided tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about structural defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: in the earthquake region of Turkey, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing criminal prosecution. The defendants are said to be responsible for structural defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Adana is also investigating possible structural defects in collapsed buildings. As part of the investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, said Anadolu. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
The penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow is dead, the Left Group in the Bundestag has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night leading up to Saturday. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a “deeply sincere socialist”.
Last night, “Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95,” announced the Left Group in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses “an important personality,” declared group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
In a message on Twitter, the leader of the Left Group, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow as a “deeply sincere and combative socialist.” Bartsch added:
“Until old age, he was an important counsellor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking.”
Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary: “The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy.”
“His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population who was unwilling and whose interests were regularly violated.”
After reunification, Modrow was a member of the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented the PDS in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow had taken a “quite critical” view of the new state. German unification had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had collapsed too unconditionally, and it had been too unilaterally condemned as an “unlawful state”, according to the dpa, Modrow had criticized in many interviews.
What happened that night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Selenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine’s energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, head of the energy company Ukrenerho, told Ukrainian television on Friday evening. Electricity supply in the Kharkiv region was particularly bad. Due to the instability of the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor unit at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power station had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukrainian nuclear power stations was cut back.
President Volodymyr Selenskyy condemned the Russian attack with some 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. But in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyy does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
February 24 will mark a year of war. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, a key supporter of Ukraine, just before the anniversary. The threat of Russian missile attacks, however, continued into the night of Saturday. In the capital Kiev late on Friday evening, an air alert was set off for the fifth time for the day. “There is a threat of a drone attack,” the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-built combat drones were also sighted and shot down over the areas of Mykolaev and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the election campaign, among others, by the FDP and the Greens to split them off, were defeated by the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, an agreement was reached on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which in future, however, is to be oriented towards the common good. This means that it does not need to generate and pass on profits.
Recovery backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consultancies are to help the federal government to monitor this process. The backlog of rail network rehabilitation is one of the main reasons why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completing the rehabilitation of entire rail corridors. The investment required for this has so far been estimated at EUR 50 billion. According to recent calculations by the railways, however, they are more likely to be as high as EUR 80 billion.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
Hermann-Wick did not have a good night’s sleep, she said after the race, was “totally excited” and her pulse didn’t drop as soon as she ran in. “Such a race,” and that at the home World Championships, “you can’t describe it with words,” she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the roaring pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other’s arms.
“Enjoy biathlon,” that’s what she wanted to do.
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had entered the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hopeful outside of the relay team. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She currently occupies fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even if the women’s performance density at the top is much higher than that of the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, the sprint victory was more likely to be won by others.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning leader. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. Back then, protesters demanding Ortega’s resignation took refuge in churches. More than 350 people died during the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry demands more orders from special funds
As a result, the first arms projects have already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened with the same thing, as reported by “Welt am Sonntag”. However, it is not yet possible to say exactly which investments would be cancelled. “There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings already at this point in time”, says the Federal Government in response to a question from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed Special Assets, which the Bundestag approved in June 2022, has to bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If the interest charges increase, less money is available for the actual purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining amount.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left at the Kupferzell motorway exit towards Heilbronn onto the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old female VW driver was driving on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, according to the police. During the turn of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two cars.
Both parties stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed “green” for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not reveal any complaints. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW each suffered minor injuries. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totalling approximately 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people in Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake catastrophe in Turkey and Syria. There is a great deal of sympathy - including in Stuttgart.
Earthquake catastrophes in Turkey and Syria preoccupy the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart’s Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had heeded the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men alike. They all listened earnestly and silently to the Imam’s prayer. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah to help the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respect for one another. The community also asked for help and strength to “bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake”.
Ditib stands by the people of Turkey and Syria. Speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the families of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The prayers were also translated into German in Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already been raised for the fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in Glockenstraße over several days to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat insert - Ebersberg
“After dinner, you should rest or take a thousand steps”.... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Thanks to the home office, those who are not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert, but rather just a stone’s throw away from the field, forest and meadow, can now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. it’s not just dog owners who hang out.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal use of the time slot. After all, why not learn about the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor on the occasion of a short walk through nature? Or meet the girlfriend you never make it to the cinema with in the evening, not even to the Alte Kino? Also, it was possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no strangers around, of course.
What is more, you can do very well is to buy goods in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, sitting on a table by the side of the road next to cheeses. Or potatoes and meat. It’s a shame if you don’t think about the purchase in advance and make the necessary arrangements. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer’s wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. “It’s a pity, we’ve forgotten the money.”
The disappointment is palpable, given that you have a companion with a wallet, but you do not have a transport container. This is what you let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: ’That is not true! You have a bag with you!’ He points to the hood of the jacket, which has been quickly thrown over before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an extra headgear unnecessary. “My wife always packs everything in there!”
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat lining and during this midday short excursion you have gained not only the back of lamb, but also a very practical idea. It is quite possible that on that day a second walk is due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for as yet unexplained reasons, veered off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. In doing so, the Audi damaged a guard post, crashed into a tree sideways and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade rescued him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured man to hospital. Since it was suspected that he was unfit to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi suffered total damage amounting to 1,000 euros.
Donald Trump’s tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: the Treasury must turn over the ex-president’s tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the department’s decision on Friday said.
Contrary to US political custom, Trump, a real-estate entrepreneur, did not disclose his tax returns either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted disclosure all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor’s office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public unless there was a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is arguably more delicate for Trump, where the scope of access is slightly larger, and details could be made public under certain conditions as the committee’s investigation progresses. Moreover, confidentiality from the House keeps leaking out.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a “victory for the rule of law.” Access to the Republican’s tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. “The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as President,” Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays out between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either -- or? As slaves of time, they rush today’s people from appointment to appointment and sometimes just push people and hamburgers in between. In her new program, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the “in-between” state.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl narrates and sings about life situations. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she brings a lot to the point - and there is one or the other between the lines. We start on Saturday, February 18, at 8.30 p.m. in the Club Bastion in Kirchheimer.
British Major Criminal Caught in Thailand After Long Escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug offender has been apprehended in Thailand. The British National Criminal Investigation Agency (NAC) announced Saturday that the man was arrested by Thai police at a Bangkok auto repair shop on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA’s Most Wanted list of most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled the start of a trial in early 2018 in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for attempting to import £8 million (€9 million) worth of amphetamines in absentia.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, is raising a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo “Make Science Great Again” fits this. Whether this fits in well with the prevailing national scientific skepticism here remains to be seen. His humor, in any case, fits very well with Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert’s recent life story, as he tried to find a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge is and what it can and cannot do. Of course, there is Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people are putting before them: What’s really important? All of this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so we’re not only entertained, but we’re also able to learn something.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle action from the perspective of a tank driver. Battles are fought in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. The valley contains rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game. In addition, UFOs appear periodically. These are unable to attack the player-tank. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation sequence, the game diagram, the initial entry for maximum results and the self-test sequence. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Game sequence
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the enemy’s tanks or missiles by observing the text displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the cockpit’s cockpit display. For example, a clue might read: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, on the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, a point representing the enemy position is visible.
The top, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player’s field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, it is easy to target him on the screen. Furthermore, at the same time, ENEMY IN THE FIRE AREA is displayed on the upper left display.
For a while, UFO’s are visible on the screen flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battlefield and are unable to eliminate either the enemy or the player’s tank. The UFO’s flying position cannot be detected by radar. UFO’s are intended to complete the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO’s can be eliminated from both the player’s tank and the enemy’s tank. A firing by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are scored: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and spins twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent’s slow-moving tank. Several options give the setup the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores a bonus tank can be released and for a more difficult game design the appearance of the missile can be varied. Details and the precise switching positions of the game flow selector for this setting are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the top scores table, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the match. The instructions are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage will delete the table with the maximum results. On RESET, the ten (10) highest scores are received with their initials and are written back on the screen to challenge other players. Each score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player’s initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer automatically inserts strokes. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence.
1. New items
The BATTLEZONE unit has five (5) new components. If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should be aware of these important differences. The new components are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI gear lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, keeps the control lever in the center position. The micro-switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC Boards. ATARI’S X/Y game circuit has been expanded to include two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and calm image. C. The Power Supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the extension of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin holding capacity. There is also a console in the device that is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability in the device’s position.
These new components, as well as all other main components of the appliance, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this marking. 2. Appliance inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Check the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the equipment service flap and check the components inside the equipment as follows: (1) Check all harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Do not forcibly connect connectors. The connectors are forced to connect correctly. A connector twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the connectors to the game PC board for correct and fixed fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the rear of the device. Check that the stamped manufacturing number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, Auxiliary PCB, Controller/Audio II PCB and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the manufacturing number can be found on the back of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the unit must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. Looking through the player’s viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright orange circled opening of the casing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the casing, which is fastened to the casing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and re-aligned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, make sure that the voltage selector on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips to help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Check System Configuration
Please take the time to verify that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. The DirectX diagnostic program allows you to get an overview of your system if you are unsure that your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX diagnostic tool, please proceed as follows: Click the “Start” button and select the “Run” option. In the text box, type “dxdiag”. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic tool is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including graphics and sound card information. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
Other programs may take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious to be active, and many are automatically started when the system is booted. Such programs, which are constantly active on your system, are also called “background applications”. In some cases, they may be the cause of your program crashing or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do so, look for the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option (“Disable”, “Close”, or similar). - Once you deactivate the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also stop general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. For more information, see the section “How to stop all unnecessary background applications”. Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it is important to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. Therefore, you should make a habit of “cleaning up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there’s a good chance that current games will run largely smoothly on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, allowing other applications you use to run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about ScanDisk and troubleshooting, defragmentation and disk cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click on the “Start” button and select the “Help” option (or “Help and Support”) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click on the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, e.g. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Error Check” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragmentation” and “Disc Cleanup”. You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or crashing. - First, try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D, real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression to push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered, especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next 10 years couldn’t satisfy my hunger. I had a dull sense that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative potential, because they were too action-oriented and overlooked a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid advances. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expressing feelings. Although this could, of course, have been done in a completely different way, the greatest merit of Fahrenheit is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on battling hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at crates for ammunition, but is far more sophisticated and in-depth. It proves that you can both tell a story and offer content without sacrificing narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new experience. If you are more skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your mind. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, where we have been forced to challenge many of the principles we previously held to be irrefutable. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit -- much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you -- didn’t pass you by without a trace either. David Cage

Transport damage
Insofar as external transport damage is recognizable, these must be immediately denounced, recorded on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage!
The unit is set for the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the unit transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to VDE regulations, the unit is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Impeccable operation of the coinage requires horizontal and perpendicular positioning of the device. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn the machine off briefly (pull the power plug) and on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Pull power plugs before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-bearing parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! At the anode connection of the image tube are approximately 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A blown fuse signals overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced by a higher quality fuse, serious damage may be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Game sequence
By pressing the appropriate start button, the game starts for one player or (with minimum credit 2) for two players. Try to get a lot of space without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game sequence is set in such a way that a minimum area must be covered before the next area (round) can be tackled. At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARXs are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARXs are released. On alert, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you’re trying to map your area, your marker goes into a death spiral, it will be destroyed because you can’t cross or return your own path. If you hesitate and don’t complete your area, a fuse will be plugged and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working correctly. For more information, see “Service Program”. The volume can be controlled at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

It is possible to install a coin counter in the device. One line to 412 V DC supply. One line to J 15 - 13 on the ROM/IC board.
SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing the 4 switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video-PC board are used.
Programming indicator. This indicator selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The “sub-test” button can be used to set the languages. When the desired language - green - appears, press the “test” button to switch to the next program display. Bet programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a “maximum number of credits” that may be before the game starts. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the “Up” or “Down” button. By pressing the “sub-test” button several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached if the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the “Up” button. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. “Test” always triggers the next program display. “Back” [Reserve High Score value x 10 000] is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display up to “High hit rate so far”. This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs to enter their own initials (names) and hit points on the screen. The “Maximum Credit” determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, if there is a coin lock, coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, credits cannot be zeroed if more than 99 is added. A free spin mode can be selected by setting “Maximum credits” to O. Other programming options: “Number of games”: Number of markers per credit
“Threshold”: Amount of % number to be reached in order to switch to the next pass
“Time limit”: allowance for additional savings
“Difficulty”: Difficulty of the game
“Tone of attraction”: at “0” no sound when stationary
at “1” sound also when stationary (animated sound) “table model”: at “0” stationary
for “1” table-top machine
Credits per coin are set on the “Slot Programming” indicator. High-Score Program indicator (highest hit rate so far). The player’s hit points and initials, including the next 10 scores, appear. The values are used to adjust to the highscore selected on the previous display (set from “back”). By pressing the “Up” button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the “Test” button, the next program display appears. The “Overall Evaluation”. By pressing the “Up” button, you can set it to 0. The following values are recorded: Total Credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts again. The total number can only be 0 when the battery or plug-in W1 is removed with the device switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits Paid: Number of credits given for homemade (converted coins). Credits Granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits Granted (Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, extended or won. % Leisure: Minutes won/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/minutes paid + credits granted
High Score: The number where a player had enough high score to push other players out of the high score list. Pressing the “Up” button sets the values to 0. Pressing the “Test” button brings up the next program display.
Insertion slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the display can select a default coin setting or program another setting.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the “Up” and “Down” buttons while the top digit on the screen is green. The values change as the digit changes. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the “Test” button, the setting is applied. If a setting that does not correspond to the default setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the “sub-test” button. After a single press, the upper setting is set to 0, which means that you can set your own setting. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that do not match. Once the setting has been made, any reset value can be selected by pressing the “sub-test” button. The default setting appears when pressed unintentionally. The “Up” and “Down” switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. Pressing the “Test” switch terminates the process. The coin multiplier (“coin unit”) tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units - “credit” shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. “bonus” coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. “mini coin” is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, “0” is not used. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If “Memory Failure - Service Required” appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which dom all programming is stored, is down. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the “Sub-Test” button or the “Self-Test” button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the “Test” button the next program will be displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in auto-test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. If the display “Open Coin Door to Test” appears, the program connector J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If the connector J 19 is removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off = on = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is incorrect, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be inserted as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected via the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing pre-determined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the gossip stops with the above display, an error has been discovered. If the communications-RAMs fail during the video-board test, the fault may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or a fault in the data-board. To locate the fault, remove the data-board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: fault in U 3, U 4 or connected circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After entering values into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits or the decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed and checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, connected multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these inscriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs show the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), the next test will be started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately, disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That’s also the reason for star number one. The second reason that the right jacket arrived without any obvious seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited for this jacket, because the disappointment was even greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to sit so tight and I didn’t want to fight into an S or M with my upper width.... In the end, it would have fit in the length and at the waist... in the rest I could swim. Besides, the feed material came to meet me when opening the parcel and spread all over the place. It’s just a pity.. It’s being sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket looks great. We were surprised at how good it was. It’s good to wear from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, and she’s really excited. She’s usually wearing the 158, and she fits the 36 pretty nicely in this case, and I’m sure she’ll be wearing it next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack, and it’s not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured myself, and the pad doesn’t fit exactly. Which is my mistake. I then slightly modified something to make it fit. The pad looks very robust, and you don’t damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or you can use the whole surface. It worked without any problems. It doesn’t slip anymore. I would buy it right away.
Too big for under 1 year
The product itself I’m okay, but not under one year. Because the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We brought it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn’t use it because of the size. Now at 12 months old we’ve looked for him again and he can use it. Has not yet been able to bite with his already few teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality insufficient / Regrettably goes back
I have been dazzled by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to point out that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important everyday things you take with you. Due to the fact that I have just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now finally too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about the purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment ensued: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can’t say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that’s just not true! I really hoped it would be, but that’s not the case. The upholstered walls are much thinner and do not offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the partitions inside are of a different caliber, much more labby. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not very good either. That is why I have decided that the backpack should go back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, I am afraid I have to pick up the money for a decent backpack. It seems that quality comes at a price here. For someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is a good choice, but it’s not for me. And it’s not like I had a hard choice to make. When I unpacked the backpack, two minutes later I knew it was going back. What I really liked was the color on the inside. I’m sure you can find your stuff a lot quicker than if you have a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is probably a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is like a little child in every fight and gets away?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, I feel, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor’s ex and didn’t believe him when he said Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn’t do it without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping this would be the last part of the series and I think this part is the weakest part and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I’m going to read the fourth part anyway and I hope it finally turns out that Taylor’s girlfriend Sarah is Volt’s ex. That would bring more suspense to the story.
Man destroys everything, doesn’t appreciate anything and doesn’t learn to do it. First of all, the movie isn’t that bad now as many people say. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and it’s conceived in the same F-scheme over and over again. Once you’ve seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and doesn’t learn to do it! And that’s exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times did I think about the movie (even though I know it’s just a movie and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, they often make you tear in your eyes. That’s why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already made really neat. It’s just a pity that people just don’t get the message behind the movie, even though it’s a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and greed and stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living things :Miss. Four stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been five stars in it. Still, well made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a movie à la 8 Mile. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn’t want to be. This movie is above all “French” - it’s also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don’t expect anything from it that it doesn’t want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, of orange, but that doesn’t matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My abdomen has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, in spite of immediate discontinuation the diarrhea remains for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller package size only 2 stars (unfortunately only seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5 ? That is very very strange!
awful smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint to a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I used it, I immediately noticed that it smells awful! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I didn’t get my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if I didn’t get a satisfactory result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn’t make any difference, my hair looked like it did the first time. Worst of all, it still smelled weeks after the application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn’t go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for some time now because of my work, not enough exercise and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only by eating healthy foods, but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not perfect !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems to “connect” with the mobile phone. This means that it is no longer charged even though you pressed the “Power On” button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and installing it again will solve the problem in 70% of cases, but it will create a new deficiency. 2) Due to frequent removal and re-installation of the phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times already. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore, for the cost of 30€, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don’t know how all these good reviews come about. After all, it’s actually a glasses cleaning towel, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very thin. Since I used it I can not exchange it anymore I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far too much more than 2 euros you should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a freebie, got broken. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell shcon in the shower), gives bass as well as bass, Bluetooth works great... You have to irrigate the suction cup, of course, otherwise it will come loose... it can play sound very loud... yeah... what I’m critical of is the frequency response of this little speaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, that causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just enough audible. My old loudspeaker didn’t reproduce bass as well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, that’s not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to take a star off. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places the color was chipped off and if you just went over with the hand the color went the same in some places. We wanted to let them pick up for free because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would exchange only the damaged parts but as if both dresser was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and sent us the money back. KUDOS to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. It comes with individual parts that you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox some stencils were damaged. I didn’t blame it, because I needed this product urgently. The adhesive provided hardly lasts, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which doesn’t get hard. Already one day after gluing almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to stick everything together. The stencils are partially punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I’m not dissatisfied. The cupboard looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic lock + nice look + stable when it is set up + shelf can be positioned arbitrarily
- Doors pop by magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some dirty places
- the included dowels are much too small and wobbly (did not have any other and did not have a cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobbly a bit (wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn’t look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Besides, I find it a little too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me .... but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately the coffee doesn’t run evenly (if at all!). Also the extra plastic waste (separately packaged see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this and collect full points soon.
Gets on my alarm clock
The alarm came quickly, and everything is easy to set up. But the natural sounds sound terrible, and they’re very loud. I couldn’t turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me, and I immediately fell out of bed. On top of that, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I used to wake up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was tomorrow. But when it happened, and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately you can’t dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so you don’t have to re-enter the clock and the wake-up time in case of a power failure. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without sockets - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me here ... There was nothing in the box either. “Pay 6 - get 4” is not a good deal. I’m sure Amazon would have dealt with this quickly and compassionately, but I didn’t find out until after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Still, it’s not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for a two-star rating. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color is more toward cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living rooms I would personally resort to warmer light. Compared to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do that and possibly I can also get intact copies according to the order. If my review is helpful, I am happy about a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I’ve received gestures and I’d like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I’ve been thinking a lot about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially convenient to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They don’t pass on the heat either, so you can touch them directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after wiping, they’re gone. Finally, I have to say that I’m very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods Sold as virgin
Amazon Prime Shipping easy tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we found significant scratches, abrasions. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the wash basin (Unfortunately). Only now we saw that also on the chrome-plated faucet itself there are scratches / streaks. This part was probably delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn’t matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get ordinary goods. Just find it sad that customers are so fucked up!!!
Product in itself top, external sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be mounted either on the wall or like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use the device measuring the values on the outside seems to be broken. However, the thermometer seems to be still intact, here still plausible values are displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably dead, because it always displays completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity. That’s a pity, because the device has been installed on the outside in a protected place, and it’s also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery Stand is still happily driving Hermes around the Republic today without finding a way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon’s service of triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is powerful, and the result is a nice cross-section. The volume is not very low, but okay. The big drawback is the catch basket. For one thing, it’s made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you put it down just briefly, of course, it’s compressed, and some of the contents fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red when the basket is half full. This would not be so bad if the mower didn’t lose large parts of the cut material from then on. Emptying the basket when it’s half full on a large lawn is not the solution. So I cleaned the mower as well as I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket it becomes unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate through the app. Very good is the plug-in sensor cable that comes with it, which can be extended if you need to. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to protect the battery only once or three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed with some fiddling. - One of the two devices is in a room with pretty thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every one or two weeks. Unfortunately, the device doesn’t reconnect on its own, even if you put it close to the router. You have to take the batteries out, put them back in after a short break, and then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There’s always an alarm if the connection is lost. The alarm tone might be a little louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the front right the screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight as well as the table too. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it’s impossible to print anything. About the setup: The setup was quite easy you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send back. I had expected something more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old gauge, unfortunately, gave up after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one looks very robust, and it’s just as accurate after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the gauge is simple, but it really serves its purpose. Otherwise, the valve leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full points for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old valve. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and didn’t wear it for the time being because it had a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly “ventilated”. When it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from Purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this necklace are a little too big for me, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I like again very nice. However, the necklace is very easy to work with, so I have already cracked the clasp twice. So far, I’ve been able to repair it again and again, but I don’t think it’s going to last long. But you can’t expect anything really high-quality for the cheap price.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can’t open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, that makes it even softer and smoother. But if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connect only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn’t work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it didn’t last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were located next to the base station. Also the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, there was no use for me! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase anyway, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted off. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction pipe and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport defect, the plastic casing was cracked and the ventilation vents were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a bit better than just using a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic casing did not affect the pumping performance.
You could have thought it through better. Since I deal with a lot of different keys, I thought an organizer like this would be more comfortable than walking around with a huge set of keys all the time. Initially, everything went pretty well. But then the paint came off pretty quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It’s nice that you can do this with a penny coin, but only with a penny coin. I couldn’t find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn’t have ruined the whole screw right away. Now to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths by the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need pliers to pull the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys to itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Finally, the third time I mounted the screw in the thread broke off and the whole thing was unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not fully correspond to the stated dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks sturdy and all this in feather weight. Since I don’t have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. I can say in advance that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment, I can’t really imagine packing everything there, e.g. for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really big pieces can be put directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8 pieces were delivered, but 10 pieces, because in the round cosmetic bag there were two smaller bags/bags. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn’t bother me personally. I regard the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that’s ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn’t. Battery? Swapped. But it still doesn’t work. So I could have thrown the money right in the trash can.
Maintenance is always good! It is easy to use, but you should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I couldn’t hear an improvement in the sound of my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. With them were two black cables. The battery life is long enough. Definitely sound enough. I liked that the headphones don’t hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also the weight is kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
Fancy dress
Very nice dress, which is well wearable for different occasions.. Price-performance agrees completely here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I’m glad I didn’t order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn’t so deep, and the sleeves could take a little more fabric (if you don’t have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
It doesn’t get any worse. I really, seriously didn’t expect this kind of junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. The USB ports are supposed to provide enough power. However, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are detected at most unreliable. The discs have to be inserted several times, after that it makes noises like you have heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90’s. After a few minutes you can either restart the computer because it doesn’t work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must never press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything else. This immediately leads to an irreversible freeze. In addition, of course, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it’s supposed to do, but it’s not pretty. First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually eye-catching, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other connector is only there to charge any device, so it’s relatively useless. I didn’t know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port, and if I only needed a nasty extension, I certainly wouldn’t have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB-Stick doesn’t just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad purchase, but my euphoria stays within tight limits :-).
Small but oh! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back already couldn’t. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn’t fit with the adapter. Well it also holds so secure and has contact from there... All in all a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. Also very small the whole thing and made in an aluminum piece sturdy. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. Not exactly light or quiet but has a lot of power. I find the middle setting of the temperature (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on stage 2. Has also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location is felt to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters which is not disturbing. I would buy him again any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently he lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a great solution which would manage 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery doesn’t have to last and we find it impractical to change it every day. You should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing. Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, after only a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. The last pair of shoes in normal use did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for class. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, at first glance, these are poorly made. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and very probably won’t last five years like my previous ones. I’m curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on good luck. In the scope of delivery were the mattress and a car air pump included. Regarding the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn’t reappear again. In the pumped-up condition a lie test was carried out directly. It fits nicely on it, and it’s a great fit for the festival. Of course, this mattress can’t replace your own bed, but it’s a luxury for days at the event. It fits nicely in my car. Before, we took out the back seats. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the plug was broken (somewhat at the soldering point). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked brilliantly and pumped up the mattress in zero comma nothing. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I am looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope it doesn’t lose air and last a long time. I also hope it doesn’t turn up mold again. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is ripped open by several doors on day 1. On the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts because they were already coming to his liking. The parts often come out messed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car in order to put the parts in place. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all, the windscreen. It is also very difficult to reinstall.) As such, I would not buy this calendar anymore, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and make it better. :\
a real drone
I’m really excited about the drone. My seven-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, it flies really well, and five minutes of flying time is usually enough. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and that the drone would break down very quickly, given the price, but falling from the ceiling to the floor, whether it be tiles or carpets, is not a problem. Nice contact if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable by force to Steam. Didn’t see when I bought it that it’s not a game CD but just a code to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you’re forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been hanging up all the time, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. The big hitch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery when not used. When a lot of news came in the day, the battery was already out at noon / early afternoon and then you can no longer even read the time. So for, me not usable. Very bad.
Noble sleeve with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it’s really important to get a sleeve. The last thing I liked was a sleeve that you can also put your credit card in. This is the sleeve here. If you put your cards in all three compartments, it’s too much, so the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case looks sturdy and looks good. It looks classy. Unlike many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, only the ports have recesses. Otherwise, you can operate the on-off switch and the volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the leather QI charging station from TORRO it is not possible. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality cover with armored glass foil
Sturdy case with a real armored glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can be easily put on. The material is comfortable to use and does not dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some footing. It’s not too bulky and it’s firmly attached to the phone. Overall, a good buy.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of foetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to high levels of HLA Class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T-cells in maternal circulation and fetal cells in affected skin tissue has been demonstrated in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism may induce SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like reaction.

Still’s disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease only begins in adulthood, and is referred to as Still’s disease with onset in adulthood (“adult onset Still’s disease”).
Diagnostic criteria include characteristic rash, joint discomfort, fever and leukocytosis, as well as hepatic dysfunction, sore throat with no detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and lack of rheumatic factor or anti-nuclear antibody titers.
We report about two adult patients who were ill for some time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still’s disease.
The rash of M. Still is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply limited maculae, which are very volatile.
By slight friction, erythematous Köbner phenomena can be triggered in the rash, which, as we describe here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the rash.

The examination of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
For the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma or a differential diagnosis of melanocytic nevus, uniform and reproducible histological criteria should be required.
The tumor parameters of prognostic relevance and importance for the therapeutic procedure must be fully and uniformly recorded in the histopathological report for malignant melanomas.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanomas are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children are a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Infections with a large number of pathogens are possible, the main ones being the usual bacterial pathogens Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses.
However, in 25-30% of cases the respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
Medical history, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often of little help in finding a diagnosis.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage provides a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%; the remaining cases have to be diagnosed by an open lung biopsy at the appropriate hospital.
Most women affected are younger to middle-aged.

Based on pre- and postoperative CT scans of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbal vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to test the efficiency of direct repositioning of stenogenic posterior edge fragments under intraoperative sonographic control.
51%) compared to those without neurological disorders (reduction of ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is farther than between Th 11 and L 1, and thus tolerates greater constriction.
In fractures without neurological symptoms, fragment repositioning promises to avoid late damage of the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudicatio.
A preliminary investigation should be carried out to determine whether there is evidence of ultrasound analgesia as a function of the prescribed power density (LD) in patients with non-radicular back pain during serial administration.
An overview of the literature shows that complicated and difficult to replicate mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, whereas simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal part of the mandibula can also be successfully treated by monocortical mini-plate osteosynthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a ranking value for the classification of trauma, seems to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between the two therapeutic concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for the description of lower jaw trauma that all studies carried out so far with their low number of cases can at best provide a rough differential indication.
As long as no prospective multicenter study is available, which could help in the choice of the osteosynthesis procedure, functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications should be preferred in the fluid range between “easy” and “difficult” fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that allows the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representation of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, a software was developed that allows the objective recording of the location and type of the changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these studies is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the aid of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of anatomical bone structures created from the tomography data of a patient.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robotic systems can help with the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned and with spatial orientation in the operating situation.
After the successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction of laboratory analyses are increasingly leading to a new re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed close to the patient outside of central or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and transport problems, and the need for only small sample volumes.
Although these benefits are often highlighted, they do not translate into clear clinical benefits.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/or maintenance of analytical equipment by untrained station staff, lack or lack of calibration and/or quality control, cost due to multiple equipment and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also evident.
According to the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Considering the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes should be:
Haemoglobin or haematocrit, Activated whole blood clotting time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety considerations is a prerequisite.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still in the early stages of development.
It is possible that MR tomography may become an important tool in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Characteristic skeletal abnormalities occur in chronic renal failure patients.
The aim of the present studies was to comprehend the changes in the bone mass of the spine during long-term hemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, the spine was completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed in addition to the histological picture.
Vertebral body height (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular linkage (TBPf) were quantitatively evaluated.
The spine deformity index (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution over the spine known from the skeletally healthy control group.
However, the plateau-like curve decreasing from HWS to LWS is 5% lower for ROPs.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding pelvic crest biopsy.
Cases with prolonged haemodialysis have higher BV/TV values regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological crosslinking of spongiasa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis of ROP shows a much greater restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be deduced from the 2-D section planes and trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of groin hernia which, due to the course of the disease and the dissection findings made by Littré himself, did not correspond to what had been known to date.
One hundred years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bursting of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the fracture of the intestinal wall in a scientific paper on “fractures” and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the “Richter-Littré-Hernia” in the German-speaking world.
The history of this form of hernia is examined on the basis of a case report.
Asperger’s syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the disease received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disorder is unknown.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger’s syndrome is presented, with epilepsy and internal abnormalities at the same time.
Possible comorbidities of Asperger’s syndrome such as epilepsy are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections usually manifest in childhood as febrile gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
One child has been reported to have manifested the yersinia infection as tumor-shaped lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was made by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against different external yersini membrane proteins.
Only after 16 weeks of treatment with ciprofloxacin did all clinical findings return to normal.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been prospectively investigated among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were investigated which conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and which consequences arise from these findings.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of resuscitation in a large percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of Sudden Infant Death (SID).

At this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented, demonstrating the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy, followed by septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis, in the second propionibacterium acnes, could also be detected in this autologous conserve.
The source of contamination in the canned food was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous haemotherapy also carries a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and that retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a severe infection by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association who developed fungal bezoar in the renal pelvis after Candidasepsis, leading to hydronephrosis with onset of postrenal renal failure.
Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine as well as direct flushing with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy resulted in normalization of the excretion function.
In case of increasing frequency of systemic candidiasis infections, especially in neonatology, consideration should be given to the possibility of bezoar formation in the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to initiate early and effective therapy.

In the meantime, it has been shown that a proportion of patients do not respond adequately to this treatment, or do not respond adequately.
In this retrospective study, two groups of 20 responders and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the following parameters:
skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, the non-responders showed a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and of specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, non-responders were found to have a higher incidence of colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and of the intestine with Candida albicans.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized by a particularly severe atopy syndrome on the one hand and by complicating superinfections on the other.
The latter finding suggests that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal therapy may be of benefit to these patients.
Lupus erythematodes profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
Two typical case studies show the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus as well as systemic lupus erythematosus.
Clinically, subcutaneous nodular and platelet-like infiltrates are present, which may lead to ulceration and scar absorption.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is present.
A positive direct immunofluorescence test (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal boundary and the vessels is another diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance, as deep lupus erythematosus may precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81 year old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis over 45 years.
The patient died with clinical signs of low-output cardiac syndrome as a result of chloroquine-induced vacuolar cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicology.
The pathogenesis, morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been an intense research interest into the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapeutic methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies concerning the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse forms for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific advances in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, in old age, with impaired cardiac pumping function, after previous cardiac operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires a risk stratification that divides the operational risk into “low”, “medium” and “high”.
Pr‰-, intra- and postoperative patient, structural and treatment-related factors can be distinguished.
Based on this prediction, the perioperative course must be optimized by means of individually tailored, pr‰-, intra- and postoperative, multi-professional and interdisciplinin‰r organized management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, especially spinal tumors and basal tumors.
We report about a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, one spinalioma and one lymph node metastasis of malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of Xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complementation analysis, which assigned it to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with breast, thoracic wall and/ or abdominal wall malignancies that have remained untreated for years will require large defects after tumour resection.
The use of silver-containing activated charcoal tissue (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn) prevented infection after flank replacement by omentum surgery during the resection of an extended basalioma.
After secondary mesh force coverage, fibrosation and calcification of the omentum led to a stable fuselage wall even without the use of plastic netting.
The 2000 health reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health system.
The monopolies of hospitals providing inpatient care and of private doctors providing outpatient care are not affected.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, compulsory catalogues for outpatient operations that may not be performed in an inpatient setting will be specified.
The obligation to ensure quality assurance is clarified and strengthened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multi-organ failure is a complex immunological process, influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurring throughout the system and the activity of which is only minimally reflected in the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibit the activation of NF-B and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and system-wide.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
Symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually non-specific.
Radiological studies often show only lightening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities.
Root apex resorption may be another important finding.
After a brief historical outline, based on the currently valid WHO classification, the current state of knowledge is briefly presented for each individual type.
The current therapeutic concept is then developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
Generalized cheerfulness disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness often recognized only late in the day, characterized by a uniformity of emotional experience in the face of circumstances such as those that are usually the cause of depressed mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusation or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the patient’s quality of life and prevent adverse long-term individual and social consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a treatment regimen that specifically interferes with the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and save the life of the patient.
In this article, the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy is presented with a special focus on molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental-CT/denta-scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandibula and maxilla.
It is particularly useful in distinguishing bone lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows an accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In the absence of knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is not currently possible.
The majority of the currently available studies of oral IC therapy were not randomized, double-blind or placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, therefore, there is no uniform standard for the oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple verrukous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinical and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin changes and are clinically similar to Dari follicular dyskeratosis, seborrheic keratoses or planar warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective cornification.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin abnormalities and must be distinguished from severe congenital cornification disorders, which show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic agents are often used in procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in cardioanesthesia.
However, there is concern about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECZ should be compared.
The diagnostic imaging of manubriosternal arthritis in psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
The involvement of the manubriosteran joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized for endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic in Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.
This retrospective work should examine the functional results of the surgical treatment.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of Pseudologia phantastica as a child.
The determinants of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this paper.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in early and late forms of chronic juvenile oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect as a function of the characteristic HLA B27.
In this study, the medical history of a patient with severe compulsive symptoms since the age of 14 is presented.
This is not an independent obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
When treating exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms in 31 years of age with clozapine, there are no psychotic symptoms or significant compulsive symptoms in the one-year catamnesis.
While the literature increasingly points to compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication mostly in the area of indications of chronic schizophrenic psychosis, here - as far as the author knows - the rare case of compulsive symptoms improved by clozapine in schizophrenia is described.
The importance of the differential diagnosis of compulsive phenomena for an adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of the individual case.
An isomorphic stimulus effect (Koebner phenomenon) is called a disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli.
The induction of such a Koebner phenomenon has been reported in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by a UV-B light test with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
It also describes the case of a 28-year-old patient who developed new psoriasis in the viral efflorescence after a varicella infection.
Since the patient planned to spend several months abroad in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was made on the exclusion of oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, on the question of genetic risk factors to develop such a disease, and on the question of whether rheumatic factors can occur as a vaccine response;
First experiences and results are reported with 13 single-stage reconstructions of large complex defects in the head-neck area with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis-major islet lobes.
Complete flap losses did not occur in any case.
The free forearm graft produced better functional and aesthetic results, but the surgery times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major lobes are the poor modelling ability and a limited rotation radius.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
Whereas up to now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was primarily regarded as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, recently there have been indications that exogenous factors can cause endothelial cells to become inflammatory even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules may be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically acting shear forces.
Endothelial cells are thus not only subject to the control of tissue mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, are an indication for local administration of rTPA.
We report our results.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of myofibroblastar cells arranged in palisades (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin), their diagnostic criteria include peripherally accentuated hemorrhage zones and the presence of characteristic asbestos structures (“amianthoid fibers”), which correspond ultrastructurally to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor identity is important for the differential diagnosis of primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasia.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel internal rails, obstruction and kinking could be reduced and the congestion of the proximal cavity system could be reduced.
Furthermore, in addition to the flow of urine within the rails, this technique allows an increased flow between the rails, which is considered to be the decisive mechanism of urine passage in the case of lying urethral rails.
In cases of extrinsic urethral compression where insertion of a single internal splint does not provide adequate reduction of ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J urethral splint should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication alternative that may prevent some patients from inserting a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive procedures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis), intradiscal application of chymopapain is the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful consideration of the indications and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis allows an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy, closing the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
A prospective study should evaluate the value of diuresesonography compared to the diuresenephrogram (“gold standard”) in children with urinary transport disorders.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic method in the treatment of basaloma.
The method has been developed and modified over the past 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same objective:
radical removal of the tumor while preserving the non-infested tissue of the surrounding area.
However, there are significant differences in the technique of tumor excision, the attachment of histological sections and the histological assessment of preparations.
A methodological stocktaking is carried out and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency between primary trauma and malignant transformation is approximately 30 years.
The “Marjolin ulcer” is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with a lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiotherapy and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after correspondingly broad local excision was covered with a retrograde stalked A. radialis flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic adverse reactions than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anaesthetics in postoperative pain management is presented, including in the context of patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCA).
The intrathecal mode of administration has several advantages over the epidural mode.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
The neurotoxicity of opioids appears to depend on different forms of administration.
There is no clinical advantage of thoracic versus lumbar injection in terms of the quality of analgesia, serious adverse reactions, amount of opioid administered or postoperative pulmonary function.
There is evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with high preoperative risk and is also cost-effective.
Thanks to the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutant tests are collected centrally at the participating centers in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, perubalsam and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
In addition, differentiated lists of allergens for defined patient groups (by sex, age, eczema location, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and specific questions were compiled for 1995.
For nickel, fragrance mix and perubalm, men showed markedly fewer positive reactions than women.
Younger patients were more likely to respond to thiomersal, older patients to medical externa.
Medical allergens were also commonly positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found in hand eczematics.
Nickel and fragrance mixed allergens had higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve quality in the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
Approximately 95% of all people infected (contacted) with M. leprae do not have an overt outbreak of the disease.
The clinical appearance is not so much determined by the direct effects of bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
This review article takes into account current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinical response, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies were presented for the quantitative investigation of the Tyndall phenomenon in the aqueous chamber (KW) by means of lasertyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BCS compared to the tyndall intensity in the KW in uveitides of different localizations, the extent to which the tyndall increase is actually caused by a BCS disturbance should be investigated as an example.
The present experimental study investigated the influence of acamprosat, a glutamatergic modulator and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on neurological deficiency after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubing, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The strong immune response against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are essential for neurite regeneration.
Positive animal experimental results do not stand up to clinical review, since in animal experiments poor regeneration performance may occur despite the impaired regeneration pathway.
Morbidity from acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term consequences constitute the greatest gynaecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of HIV-infected women developed symptoms of urogenital infections, one-third cervical dysplasia.
A quarter experienced chronic complaints and late sequelae of ascending genital infections over the course of time.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea have been observed in an increase.
Pregnancy complications include premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth.
No progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy has been observed.
Risks of peripartal transmission to the foetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with delivery such as premature birth, premature labor, amniotic infection, duration of bladder jumping and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternal-foetal HIV-1 transmission can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8 %), primary low-contamination Caesarean section (4-6 %), and most effectively by primary section and concomitant prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2 %).
Dendritic cells play a central role in the initialization of the immune response, as they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system able to activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies in patients with treatment-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized with tumor antigens can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since little basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumour tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis was investigated immunohistologically.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, are detectable mainly in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with clinical parameters, patients with low carcinoma dendritic cell counts (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor for the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered to be a major factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure patients.
In the present study, in patients with renal insufficiency, in addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways were determined: transulfuration (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methylmalonate and 2-methyl citrate).
We report two cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on a history of cat scratches and typical findings of lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the prevalence and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients treated in a university polyclinic or dermatologist’s practice in the years 1984-94 was carried out on the basis of patient records and partly also by follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was 0.05%.
Out of a total of 56 affected patients (31 females, 25 males), 49 had the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years and the mean duration of illness was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of patients were atopic and 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests have been positive only in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, mostly with moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 MIU for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracyclines 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10) 13 patients experienced a complete remission and 8 patients improved.
Spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) for a follow-up period of 6.5 years.
The surprisingly good treatment successes with antibiotic therapy underscore the need for further elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary A 56-year-old patient presented primarily with low back pain is reported.
Laboratory chemistry, radiology as well as histopathology showed the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeated sample excisions, histologically the picture of a non-specific inflammation was found.
A highly malignant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma could only be detected histologically during the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal.
CHOP chemotherapy and radiotherapy were administered.
Spinal lymphomas should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, particularly in progressive cases.
Nasoethmoidoorbital complex fractures (NEO-fractures) are associated with midfacial and/ or frontal base fractures in more than 90% of cases.
Accompanying cranial base fractures pass through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa in up to 70% of cases.
There are different approaches to treating isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and skull base fractures in midfacial fractures.
In the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midfacial fractures not involving the base of the skull, repositioning and care was performed via a subcranial route.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extra-cranial and transcranial treatment of fractures of the os ethmoidale involving the base of the skull and the middle face is presented.
However, there is a high risk of bleeding both intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and mainly phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be surgically treated.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden decrease in the terminal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and a cardiovascular arrest.
Resuscitation was immediately initiated with cardiac massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In mainly fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed under continuous cardiac pressure massage.
After 21/ 4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/ 2 hours after the start of lysis moderately stable hemodynamics were achieved with continuous, high-dose catecholamine administration and volume replacement.
Mass transfusion was required as a consequence of lysis and loss of coagulopathy.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of “pulmonary embolism” was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with continuous resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were dispensed with.
During anaesthesia with the new inhalation anaesthetic, sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total intake is metabolized.
The magnitude of the resulting serum peak values of inorganic fluoride determine, in particular, the rate of hepatic defluoridation, the total amount of anaesthetic administered and the solubility of the anaesthetic gas as expressed by its blood-gas partition coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, no increased renal risk of fluoride exposure to sevoflurane has been demonstrated in animal studies, routine clinical use or prolonged anaesthesia, or when used in patients with renal insufficiency.
The recently documented low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane, in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane, is considered to be an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol still used in the literature was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anaesthetic gases sevoflurane, enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those found after anaesthesia with sevoflurane, are therefore to be classified as clinically safe.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischaemic heart disease, the choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance.
The best results are the base-parallel lamellation of the heart ventricles after fixation and the transverse lamellation of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if postmortem coronary angiography cannot be preceded.
In this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarctions, their age and subsequent conditions can be better understood and assigned to the respective coronary care area than in the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the bloodstream.
In the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque haemorrhages, parietal and occludatory thromboses can be assessed intact, as well as the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in cases of acute cardiac death and only briefly survived territorial ischemia.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can be detected in correlation with coronary morphology and coronary supply area.
However, recent prospectively randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection does not provide additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as well as for adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus, the esophagastral transition and the stomach are inconclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumours, several phase III studies did not demonstrate convincing predictive gains from preoperative radiation, chemotherapy or combined radiation/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival benefit with this multimodal approach is expected only in response to pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radiotherapy improves response rates, at least in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but also results in increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out in the context of prospective studies in strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Childhood carpal tunnel syndrome is a rarity.
This disorder is unusual for childhood and is usually only associated with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or “hysterical” symptom formation can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescence experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, deerealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Unassimilable memories of trauma have a retraumatizing effect and have to be warded off by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behavior or social “acting”.
Against this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements the experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a secure inner space and contact with inner helpers is created in the imagination resource-oriented.
The actual trauma work consists in a dosed, stable confrontation, but as little retraumatizing as possible, introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and leaving oneself behind.
In the final phase, the focus is again on the resource-oriented approach to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record developments in a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the past 20 years in terms of diagnoses and the proportion of multiple impaired persons.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have many causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women (“pseudotumor cerebri”), venous drainage obstruction is possible as a cause.
The extent to which visual acuity remains stable in the long term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy was investigated and the causes and risk factors for visual deterioration were identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by most disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the port of entry.
After inoculation, HIV may start to multiply after 24 hours and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can detect HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, and the antibody response is weakened during therapy;
with nuleic acid tests, the detection is achieved from around the eleventh day.
In almost 100 years of development, countless natural, foreign and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadruple tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
The use of corpse grafts is also justified, subject to certain limitations.
Individual transplants show specific differences in biomechanical properties, primary fixation and bone canal healing.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of any of the above-mentioned transplants could not be verified.
The graft selection must take into account the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament.
Careful preoperative planning is required in the treatment of complex ligament injuries and in cases of revision.
The rare course of the development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
In the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed 2 times in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
Histological reprocessing revealed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, proportions of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
Clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and histological features are discussed taking into account the literature.
Coronary lime is indicative of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately by electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance of calcium screening in patients with known coronary artery disease or in asymptomatic patients varies as primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically important part of coronary artery disease.
Frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects with regard to ergometrics are presented, as well as guidance on prognostic evaluation and practical implications are given.
We report about 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, both disorders occurred in the context of type II autoimmune polyendocrinopathy.
In contrast, we have not observed a case of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Therefore, patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus should exclude other diseases from the array of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
Securing the airway after upper airway operations may be problematic in some patients.
Safe reintubation should therefore be ensured if necessary.
Two patients with recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma have been reported with severe intubation difficulties and therefore high risk factors for intubation and, if necessary, reintubation under general anaesthesia.
A fiber-optically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and grading of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucous tumor propagation pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for stage classification and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive examinations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity of both methods is lower than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two section imaging techniques is important from a clinical point of view, as it makes it possible to exclude neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucous tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable indications of possible etiology, the extent of submucous growth and the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators (ICDs) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with end-stage renal disease have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.
There are few cases of myocardial revascularisation by PTCA in patients undergoing chronic dialysis, suggesting a high overall rate of peri-interventional complications and a high rate of restenosis.
We studied the restenosis rate in 23 patients with end-stage renal disease (17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primary PTCA success, all patients underwent recoronal angiography within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic monitoring, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginal symptoms.
In laboratory chemistry, patients had hypertriglyceridaemia (265 +/- 160 mg/ dl) and hypercholesterolaemia (258 +/- 53 mg/ dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/ dl) with a marked increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/ dl).
It describes the case of a 64-year-old patient who experienced complete pelvic instability within one year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.
The triggering event was retrospectively assumed to be a minor trauma to the pelvis.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthrosis, the diagnosis was based on the suspicion of a malignant event.
Hip pain in childhood is caused by a broad spectrum of different conditions.
The main focus is on non-traumatic causes in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, a diagnostic imaging algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand and to avoid missing necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Exemplary examples demonstrate some common, but also rarer, diseases.
The iatrogenic rupture of the trochanter major in the prosthetic care of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called “rear access” could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early-functional conservative treatment is recommended for isolated traumatic trochanter detonation, even in the case of significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care remains controversial.
The present thesis presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
The ZUF-8 examines relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patient utilization patterns and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This shows that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
In further utilization behavior dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic work relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the work relationship.
The effects found are relatively large, but in absolute terms these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after treatment.
Changes in male aging are similar to changes in younger hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels decline on average with age, correlations between discomfort in middle and older age and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men and multiple influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnoea for 5 days received ultrasound prior to planned lysotherapy following nuclear medicine evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
A right atrial, floating thrombus was found.
In case of acute vital risk, ultra-high dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus completely resolved and the thrombosis of the leg largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with a mean age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in road accidents.
A single fracture was observed in 50% of the patients and the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
The average duration of hospitalization was 17 days and the average use of crutches was 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid healing process.
The majority (85%) experienced no complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) patients with open fractures and only 2 (0.4%) patients with closed fractures, which is within the normal range.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femur diaphyse with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and shows comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastatic diagnosis in head and neck tumors remains controversial.
In this retrospective study, 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were evaluated to determine which factors influence the incidence and location of remote metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary cancer diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastases was positively correlated with the initial tumour stage (p<0.00001) and with the manifestation of local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or second tumour outside the ENT region (p<0.0005).
The parameters ’primary tumor localization’ and ’histopathological tumor grading’ did not have an independent predictive value, but reflected essentially different frequencies of tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for remote metastases in tumors of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to an X-ray examination of the chest.
Further diagnostic procedures consisting of abdominal ultrasound, skeletal scintigraphy and/ or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax are indicated in locoregionally advanced tumors, in recurrent tumors and in second tumors outside the ENT region.
However, one should always ask the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article gives a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the late 19th century to the present day.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small group of early psychoanalysts who worked enthusiastically and in “productive orthodoxy” for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he founded the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and the first psychoanalytic hospital (“Sanatorium Schloß Tegel”) in Germany in 1927.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be seen as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions in the professional societies.
He is a credible professional political identification figure for all generations, especially for the new specialist in “psychotherapeutic medicine”.
Nevertheless, Simmel’s emphasis should not mean that the 60 or so other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish ancestry, are no longer duly remembered.
Basically, four post-traumatic states of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femur head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of the leg bingeometry is of central importance.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to an individual problem.
The aim of the study was to provide a meta-analytical review of all available randomized controlled studies in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in a number of systemic diseases.
In some cases, subjective symptoms and visus-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term by systemic immunosuppression.
Disorders in the movement of the vertebral joints lead to a one-sided compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs in more than 80% of cases on the compression side, a causal relationship can be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the case of a herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, designed for malignant changes in the area of the pancreatic head, is very extensive and burdened with high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation was performed in the patients in a blood-saving manner and almost without complications.
At a median follow-up of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were free of symptoms, and in one patient who underwent surgery for a gastrinoma, elevated gastrin values were observed late postoperatively.
Compared to the preoperative function test, the endocrine and exocrine function were only slightly impaired by the operation.
If strictly indicated, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can be treated adequately, sufficiently radical, with minimal complications and without permanent impairment of exo- and endocrine functions by means of duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered to be a safe and reliable method for the treatment of symptomatic and/ or prognostically significant bradycardiac arrhythmias.
Approximately one in six patients subsequently dies after pacemaker implantation due to sudden cardiac death, which is predominantly due to the progression of the underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrostimulation of the heart may carry the risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Particularly in advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-induced R-on-T phenomena, “short-long” sequences and cognitive defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-induced secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding and awareness of the pathomechanisms involved should be the best precondition for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but, above all, safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. determining the extent of the disease, serves to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with a curative objective, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and who are given alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), ultrasound of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for the staging of bronchial cancer.
For specific questions, e.g. after thoracic wall infiltration, and in patients with a contrast agent allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to CT.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F]2-flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) for assessment of lymph nodes and remote metastases, in-111-octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical value is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor necrosis, could play an important role in the staging of bronchus cancer in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdominal cavity, the retroperitoneum and the small pelvis, the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs may be damaged.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, the prevention of these side effects is particularly important in the treatment of tumors.
Impaired erection or dysfunction of ejaculation may occur after surgical, radiotherapeutic or drug treatment of various tumors.
Thanks to an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now largely preventable.
If damage to the corresponding neural pathways cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunctions are a significant limitation of the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction can be treated by a number of therapeutic modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavia artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the cervical vessels at different cannulation locations.
There is a report of a truck driver who developed atypical heparinduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) following bruising of both legs while undergoing medicated thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
in addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in thrombocytes with positive antibody detection against heparin:
During our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically cleaved in the left lower leg.
After the exclusion of other possible causes for these reactions, antibodies to heparin (heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient developed a full-scale anaphylactic reaction which was immediately reversed by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, otherwise characterized by HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the different forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Types I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody response without thrombocyte drop and type IV is the antibody response with general allergic symptoms.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the second edition of the “Histological Typing of Salivary gland Tumors” of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991.
It was first described by Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant salivary gland tumors.
The gl. parotis is the site of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
Therapy consists of surgical tumor removal with an adequate safety margin and histologically controlled tumor clearance of all resection margins.
According to current knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma has a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastatic rate of 10% up to 10 years after first manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present study, a modified animal model of renal xenotransplantation was developed in which the course of a hyperacute rejection response is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs to Wistar rats as recipient animals, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta or V. cava and urethral drainage using spines to monitor diuresis.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation with the help of soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenotransplants.
A total of 24 xenotransplants were performed and treated randomly with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
Soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival time (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was observed in the sCR1 group due to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
Histologically, only 10 min after the start of reperfusion, large amounts of platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates were detected in the control group.
In contrast, renal grafts treated with sCR1 showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombin formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed a similarly reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the treatment group.
Up to now, 52 laparoscopic procedures have been performed in our facility on the gall bladder, stomach, colon and hernia using the optical guidance robotic arm controlled by the operator’s voice.
The field of view is determined directly by commands of the operator.
During all interventions, the control of the robotic arm was precise, the voice recognition accurate and without any technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by one surgeon alone as “solo surgery”.
For a further 20 procedures, only one assistant besides the surgeon was used.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications by DSA in kidney and pancreatic transplantation requires invasive intervention in mostly diabetically pre-damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents may have nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitides should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation between the trauma surgery and the medical clinic of the Klinikum Minden.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows the targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and anti-tuberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapeutic result and a review of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both in terms of local recovery of the infection and in terms of functional results.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electric cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor an interruption of the underlying wavefronts of atrial fibrillation.
Thus, the mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the mechanisms of cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicular fractures are rare.
They occur as primary lesions, more often than secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with constriction of the costoclavicular space.
The observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus following a clavicular fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported casuistically.
Diabetes mellitus type I belongs to the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The purpose of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patients of the Diabetes Outpatient Department of the Pediatric Clinic of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of absorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgery has been reported, resulting in a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiological evidence showed osteolysis in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was a sterile inflammation with detection of foreign-body giant cells.
Prim‰re plasmocytomas of the kidney represent a gross rarity‰t.
So far, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in whom an operated renal tumor was histologically proven to be a plasmocytoma.
Based on this case, the management of this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement due to plasmocytoma is unclear.
In a multicenter, prospective, clinical study from 17 German hospitals, 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults were treated according to the fracture type or an appropriate therapeutic procedure.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by establishing a practice-based score.
So far, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known to follow the pattern of Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired striped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We report another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are a striped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without inflammatory pre-stage and without subsequent sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We suggest the name “Atrophodermia linearis Moulin” for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be carried out safely as home training.
In group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movements and basic knowledge of anatomy, osteoarthritis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors are imparted.
The efficiency of the “knee school” as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was demonstrated in a prospectively randomized study.
The correct alignment and size of the implants is of paramount importance for successful and permanent knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are presented.
In the context of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow-VEP has been shown to be suitable for the separation of confirmed patients from confirmed controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of the air rescue, the out-of-hospital primary care of 274 acutely injured (58%) and ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 was evaluated on the basis of the emergency medical documentation, the timing of the emergency response, the age and gender distribution, severity, causes of trauma and injury patterns, the type of acute paediatric disease, pre-hospital emergency diagnosis and treatment as well as the means of transport and the target clinic.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopaedic University Clinic Mainz has been examining which diseases can use low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for interpreting patient studies in disorders of the haematopoietic system, age- and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in this study in volunteers.
Therapeutic control is currently not possible in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion condition due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without an actual propensity to relapse may be unnecessarily exposed to an anti-arrhythmic regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A precondition for P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
A P-shaft detiggering must be performed, the filtering of the P-shaft must be done bidirectionally or with an FIR-filter.
Standardization of the method is highly desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P-wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic drug does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In summary, the P-wave signal averaging after optimization of the method allows the identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
Knowledge of the genesis of pain is a prerequisite for effective pain therapy.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferences are channelled through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is based on injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain.
Treatment algorithms are used to describe the treatment of nociceptive and neuropathic pain.
In addition to classical non-opioid analgesics, coanalgesics and opioid analgesics have an important role to play, especially in chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain management standards must be observed.
Blockades with local anaesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
In post-traumatic pain, however, a defined series of peripheral nerve blockades or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockades are of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically sustained pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic outflow pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, additional irradiation of the paraaortal lymphatic outflow pathways compared to irradiation of the pelvin lymph nodes alone does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term adverse reactions are only available from studies with obsolete radiation techniques.
Radiotherapy of the lymphatic outflow pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be carried out in the context of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
Due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, however, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be permanently supplied by thin-caliber drainage.
In contrast, a large-caliber blue drainage is indicated in a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical hospital, e.g. in patients on ventilation, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
A hematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be rapidly treated with a blue drainage and, if necessary, surgically treated because of the risk of severe blood loss.
A spontaneous hematothorax also requires drainage and internal examination.
The doctor in an ICU must master the diagnosis and treatment of pneumo- and hematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 ICU patients was whether routine procalcitonin (PCT) determination in ICU patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology and radiology.
The fatality, overall injury severity, the probability of bleeding complications and the proportion of concomitant pelvic injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. the pelvic injury with accompanying peripelvinic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions are in the foreground of interdisciplinary therapy.
As joint fractures, acetabulum fractures present a special challenge.
The surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation shows the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome worsens.
The primary accidental cartilage damage appears to have a major influence on the long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
Isolated calcifying atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused symptoms typical of aortic isthmus stenosis in a 56-year-old patient.
Remarkable in the case described here is the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of the calcification.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or an expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids is via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
With reference to changes in educational and social structures, medical habilitation has recently been questioned as an academic qualification.
In the discourse on the use and development of reproductive technologies, the experiences of those affected take a back seat.
Many seek help outside of medical treatment only at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastatic sites in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
For receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the treatment of first choice.
Chemotherapy is indicated in receptor-negative breast cancer, failure of hormone therapy or detection of liver metastases.
Chemotherapy should generally be administered in the case of small cell lung cancer.
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinomas are accessible to radioiodine therapy.
In metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy tends to be cautious and is mainly limited to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in the imaging of the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for determining bone degradation products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and treatment of childhood back pain with radical symptoms or nerve elongation should be investigated.
The risk of contracting HIV occupationally is often perceived as high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, for example, there is a clear recommendation to vaccinate hospital staff against hepatitis B.
Injuries with HBV-containing material should be administered post-exposure with a combined active and passive vaccination.
There is no post-exposure prophylaxis of medication for hepatitis C.
Early treatment with interferon for detection of HCV RNA appears to have a high success rate.
A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis in preparations from a videothoracoscopic lung biopsy.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive responses in both the muscular tissue of angiomyolipoma and the smooth muscle proliferates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of an asymptomatic intracerebral malformation of up to 5 cm in diameter in the left frontal brain.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in kidney, lung and probably also in the brain led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international debate on euthanasia, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to a growing tendency to give preference to medical assisted suicide over active killing, not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 1994 on assisted suicide by a psychiatrist gives grounds for examining this problem from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) were investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
A differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostate glands, the stroma and the vessels could be detected both by the NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemically.
Compounds with obstructive hyperplasia appear to show a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation, but due to the small number of compounds, no quantitative evaluation has yet been performed.
In the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of NOS depending on the vascular section could also be demonstrated by the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemistry.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional blood circulation and secretion of normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse ileus causes, it is difficult to standardize the surgical indication and choice of surgical procedure in small intestinal ileus.
A uniform procedure for the intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of an intestinal spine) and the abdominal cavity closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Small intestine surgical techniques continue to be used (in a significant minority of clinics), whereby the Noble operation has largely been replaced by Child-Phillips and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no established indications or contraindications for plications, long probes and other surgical procedures.
Given the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of the small intestinal tract, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public’s demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results obtained by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can make it possible to increase social acceptance of reproductive medicine as a safe and successful form of treatment and, at the same time, prevent misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for providing reliable advice to the couples concerned.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle strength of depressed individuals have often been described in the clinical literature, but have not been studied empirically so far.
We measured various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework that is essentially based on classic clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized depressive subjects were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which measured stride length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed and 3 min walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The study was repeated after 3 weeks of hospitalization and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were demonstrated in the knee and elbow extension and in all gait parameters studied.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric research in this pilot study are suitable for the reliable and low-burden study of relationships between depression and motor function and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of subluxed lens.
This may result in an acute glaucoma in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or a chronic glaucoma.
YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We report on the results of cataract surgery in subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased plasma substance P levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol).
VIP plasma concentrations were not significantly different from normal except for occasional variations (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol).
We describe 2 unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of multiplex dysostosis and storage phenomena in lymphocytes up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.
L-fucosi-ase activity in white blood cells and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (<3% of normal).
To date, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombus in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We’re reporting a 4.6-year-old girl who came to hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and elevated CSF protein were detected in the CSF.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
This routine test gave strong positive results for ketones in the post-mortem of three persons who had died clearly as a result of frostbite or hypothermia, without at the same time increasing urinary glucose.
Headspace gas chromatography revealed elevated acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg in all three urine samples.
A strong positive Keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal urine glucose findings may thus serve as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study of 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the underlying bleeding source and thus provide indications for therapeutic action.
Infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is associated with several infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, papules and papulovesicles erupted symmetrically at the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, whereas serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
Jaw joint luxations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the chewing muscles.
Previous classifications are based primarily on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated maxillary joint surfaces such as luxation, subluxation and discus luxation.
Etiologically, traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations are distinguished.
A number of neurological disorders have been reported as complications.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent jaw dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic jaw dislocation.
Fiery paints can lead to significant psychosocial stress.
The present study investigated a) coping behavior, quality of life and body experience of patients with fire paints and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
As part of the treatment with flashlight-pulsed dye laser, 70 patients with fire paints were subjected to a psychological test on the areas of disease management, quality of life and body experience.
The clinical target was the degree of flame lightening during the course of therapy.
Patients with fire paints exhibited similar levels of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the firemark.
With regard to helplessness and anxiety-depressive mood, the patients were significantly less exposed to fire paints.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
Body experience is differentially influenced by disease management.
Since lightening in the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stress, flash-pulsed dye laser therapy in fire painting can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most frequently affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is a distinct disease, as its biological behavior, prognosis and treatment are different from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and in the categorization of stages of the PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological features and a wide spectrum of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had a Naevus sebaceus in the area of the right temple since birth.
Histopathological examination revealed 2 lesion-associated adnex neoplasms:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q-zags, newly occurring left hamstring block) and elevated levels of “classical heart enzymes” creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementia.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years of age.
At present, it is not the psychopathological cross-sectional picture that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia accompanied by hypothyroidism and secondary dementia caused by hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, a near-discharge aneurysm of the left subclavia artery was successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graph.
The one-year follow-up showed a very good long-term result with free perfused stentlumen and completely eliminated aneurysm.
A control computed tomography showed a fully thrombotic aneurysm sac.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
The Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a separate entity by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O’Leary in 1930.
Nevertheless, as early as the first half of the 19th century, illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie almost inevitably suggest a Pyoderma gangraenosum.
Devergie’s “Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique” contains not only case studies of different forms of syphilitic disorders of the skin but also individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy used at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as a side effect of the extensive mercury therapy, as they spontaneously healed upon discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and images of Pyoderma gangraenosum can already be found more than 100 years before the first naming.
However, the etiology of this disease has not been sufficiently clarified to date.
The theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of Pyoderma gangraenosum persisted in several publications well into the 1960s.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the main selection criteria for anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
This study examines whether recovery of cognitive function is faster after TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/R) than after sevoflurane/ fentanyl (S/F) balanced anaesthesia.
Consistent oestradiol concentrations are reached as in the early follicular phase.
Oral oestrogen replacement therapy requires a dose of oestradiol 40 times higher than that of TTS to achieve effective but highly variable drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high oral oestrogen doses are necessary because of extensive oestrogen metabolism during hepatic passage.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the foetus and newborns in diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis?
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vititium cordis, small intestinal atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia and psychomotor retardation with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The objective of the present study was to measure the exercise capacity of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exertion-dependent changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions and tumors of the urinary bladder was to better reflect the biology of the different lesions and to make a clearer distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically considered.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms with low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Shallow urothelial lesions include shallow hyperplasia, atypes (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this division is justified.
The present study attempts to establish relationships between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation in patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by sympathetic nervous system intervention.
One then speaks of sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back problems.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdomen spiral CT and a thoracic X-ray.
In case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI may be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with an absolute or relative contraindication to non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients with compensated (not yet requiring dialysis) renal insufficiency, and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common childhood eye injuries are corrosion, burn, eyelid injury, corneal erosion, corneal contamination, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants per year.
As such, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Known risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (<5 Jahre), das Geschlecht (männlich > female) and parental care.
The prognosis regarding visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with visual aids or gluing the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis) in addition to rapid and adequate therapy.
Deficits and imbalances of the spinal stabilizing muscles are considered important somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back complaints.
Therefore, the maintenance and restoration of the full capacity of the muscles which stabilize the spine must be the aim of prevention and rehabilitation, in addition to the training of coordination skills and the learning of spinal-appropriate behavior.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, the physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including neurophysiological procedures, the physico-balneological measures and the supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important method in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy encompasses the application of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In their phase structure, different therapeutic goals are presented, especially the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation course.
Indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in collaboration with physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The indication for surgery in vertebral gliding is pain, progressive gliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radical dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity remains and in spondyloptosis a plastic deformation of the ossary spondylodesemass may occur with further progression of gliding.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now possible to reposition heavy gliding processes and to restore a normal spine and trunk shape with justifiable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed which, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at the anatomical repositioning of the sliding vertebra.
Depending on the extent of the gliding, repositioning and stabilization should be performed in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
Dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
In Grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this paper, is to assess the impact of a gerontopsychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and elderly counselling) on the transformation process from “intramural” (inpatient) to “extramural” (day clinic and outpatient, mainly home-supported) regional care structures called for by the Federal Government’s Expert Commission and explained in detail.
Based on extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional sub-structures of gerontopsychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and care for the elderly (subsystem C) are analyzed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (without GZ).
With regard to subsystem A, the investigation shows that a GZ has a significant influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extra-mural care without segregating its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
One effect of the GZ on the system of care for the elderly (subsystem C) may be expressed in the fact that in the care region of Gütersloh the rate of hospitalization after hospital treatment is significantly lower than in the control region of Bielefeld.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis in the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive movement restriction in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to an edema of the skin and adipose tissue, extensive fluid accumulations around the deep muscle fascias, in the interstitia and - to a lesser extent - in the shoulder joint were detected by sonographic and computed tomography.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, the skin lesions quickly healed, and subsequently the mobility of the shoulder joint was restored.
In the case described, the involvement of structures close to the joint in the context of an eosinophilic cellulite was demonstrated for the first time with modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide allows breast-maintenance treatment in larger tumours that are not primarily suitable for breast-maintenance treatment.
Tumor recovery can be monitored by mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
Mammography is supported by good reproducibility and availability.
Mammographically indistinguishable tumors can usually be monitored sonographically.
In MRI the tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammaparenchyma.
It also allows the recording of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited by all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially non-invasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not reverse even when the invasive tumor recedes and typically indicate intraductive, non-invasive tumor residues.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
This report discusses the treatment of pronounced GBS in intensive care using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Stent implantation without pretension appears to be able to induce dissection immediately in case of morphologically suitable stenoses.
Neurosurgical therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PK) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, based on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-pronged functional model clarifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei were successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - In the clinic, lesional as well as restorative and stimulative procedures are currently used.
Previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to improved neuroradiological and physiological targeting.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigors, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, while the latter has proven to be effective in the treatment of tremors.
Only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a new sprout of dopaminergic neurons and an increased striatal dopamine secretion documented;
However, the process raises ethical and immunological problems.
Continuous high-frequency stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest method and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamus nuclei to treat tremors;
Animal experiments include xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual methods are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol-related disease along with more common disorders such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal spasms, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic lateral sharp potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted with a suspected diagnosis of encephalitis after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body.
Laboratory studies have shown elevated values for gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-fold anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and worsening of the general condition have continued to be observed.
Several EEG studies revealed periodic steep left parietookzipital stressed waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basaliomas in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell naevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, organoid naevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (86 cases in the world literature so far).
Etiologically, it could be an abortion form of the BZNS or the consequence of somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Mechanisms of repair of UV-induced DNA damage have not been studied in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basalioma of the right infraorbital region is reported.
Neither the medical history nor the clinical examination indicated a genetic predisposition to produce basalioma.
In 604 patients with chronic myeloid leuk‰mia (CML), an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed using pelvic crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Based on the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursor cells, and fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was observed in approximately 28% of patients at diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+-nucleated erythropoietic prol‰bank cells, which may be related to the incorporation of this cell line in iron metabolism, H‰moglobin synthesis and degradation of the extensed normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expremant) pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 30% of pre-treatment biopsies.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis could be calculated with clinical parameters such as H‰moglobin level, the proportion of myeloid and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood and Milzgrˆfle.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric analysis, a classification into three different histological subgroups was made:
Appropriate ha‰matological data were associated with this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies of 173 patients receiving monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main‰ cell lines during treatment were best illustrated by calculating indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated sampling and the associated temporal differences.
For example, in patients with complete h‰matological remission after IFN, regeneration of erythropoiesis was observed along with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups were able to detect a ‹transition from both a (non-fibrated) granulocyte‰ren and megakaryocyte‰ren subtype to a myelofibrotic group in approximately 40% of patients.
This ph‰nomen was in contrast to a numeric reduction of the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients under HU therapy, in 17 F‰llen (36%).
Taken together, the striking heterogeneity‰t of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 patients admitted consecutively to a medical geriatric ward should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination as well as the results of the mini-mental-state examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as uninvestigable.
The remaining 74 patients were clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia may have been detected or ruled out by neuropsychological tests.
Mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found in 41 patients, in more than half of them the disorder was relevant to the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used have proved to be reliable and can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains to be seen how the required treatment of the mental disorder in the setting of a medical-geriatric ward can be ensured for every 5th to 6th patient after this result.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis are considered problematic in the early stages because the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are investigator dependence, lack of standardization and still relatively high costs.
For this reason, the “Diagnostic Imaging Working Group in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Center Berlin”, which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of sacrilitis, in which not only the clinical background but also technical details, radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmune globulin E syndrome (Job’s Syndrome, Job’s Syndrome, Buckley’s Syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that may show characteristic manifestations in the ENT region.
The disease is characterized by recurrent urticarial rash, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Highly elevated serum IgE concentrations in the absence of evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases are diagnostic trends.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was highly tolerated and effective.
More than a year after the single treatment, the symptoms have improved continuously.
The current state of knowledge and available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, IVIG therapy should be an option of first choice.
The present paper presents the results after laparoscopic “floppy nissen” fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual subdimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
More than 98% of all patients rated the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new anti-reflux operation if necessary.
Persistent but not quality of life adverse effects of surgery were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required re-treatment with anti-reflux medication.
Laparoscopic refundoplicatio was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 months of surgery due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic “floppy nissen” fundoplicatio can be documented and proven in the longer term not only by objective findings, but also by means of the patient’s subjective assessment and by the measurement of quality of life data.
Significant are the clinical symptoms of neuroglucopenia, demonstrating inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appear to be superior to selective tumor removal.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolisation and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable according to § 216 StGB;
It is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
The manifold tendencies to make “killing on demand” punishable under certain conditions, as in the Netherlands, also in Germany does not change this.
Nutrient proportions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished from immunologically active cells of the intestinal-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and a major supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in the severely ill.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are particularly important for the eutrophy of immuno-competent intestinal cells as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are fermented bacterially in the lower intestine sections into mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These exert a trophic effect on the colon mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the nutritional substances, the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological well-being.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual evaluations of situational factors influencing care and, on the other hand, stress-promoting factors in the care process.
The results show large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors as well as their effects on physical and psychological well-being.
Successive fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the ankle area.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term outcome.
Computed tomography (CT) is indispensable for the definitive diagnosis and the indication of the therapy to be used.
Displaced fractures lead conservatively, as described in the literature and according to our own experience, to pain and restriction of movement and thus to long-term arthrotic alteration of the subtalar joint.
However, the scant literature indicates that large fragments should be anatomically re-fixed in order to allow a seamless healing.
Debris fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, but the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unexplained, there are a number of new insights into the underlying pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
For example, a proliferation of dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in serum, indicating a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in indolent mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to common assumption, acute urticaria is infrequently caused by IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies to foodstuffs (73%) and, more rarely, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-lasting responses to avoidance (diet) or elimination of triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are primarily secondary and not disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a life-threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports should show the variability of the possible injuries together with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
Diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which is usually treated only in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the temporal sequence of the polytraum management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of treatment.
Reports from previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small patient population show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus to define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, whereby cross-references are made to the management together with the mostly polytraumatized and consequently vitally endangered patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-Cadherin in papillary thyroid cancer was analyzed.
Of these 78 patients, the postoperative course of 2 months to 35.2 years is known (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-Cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found in higher T-stages, there were more synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In the statistical analysis, the e-Cadherin expression (<= 20 %/ > 20%), a synchronous remote metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1) and the radicality of the procedure (R0/R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant.
Our data support a prognostic significance of e-Cadherin expression in papillary thyroid cancer.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a threat to adults due to the postponement of the peak age.
Combination MMR vaccination is an effective method to prevent this disease and its sequelae.
The 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make rubella embryopathy a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and tolerability.
The regional comparison showed differences in personality in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness as well as in subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region resulted in openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement and physician judgement.
More than 80% of intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and occur mostly after abdominal surgery.
They are divided anatomically into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Sonographic or CT-controlled percutaneous abscess drainage is today a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approx. 80 % for defined indications.
Liver abscesses are predominantly interventional, pancreatic, spleen and crohn abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amoebiasis) are diagnosed late due to their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics.
Since the mid to late 1980s, different research groups have tried to improve the prediction of premature birth by means of immunological diagnostics - in particular cytokine detection.
The disadvantage, however, is that this prenatal diagnosis is so far only convincing from the amniocentesis, i.e. amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytocine diagnostics is the high variability of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
The detection of cytokine from the cervix of pregnant women by means of PCR technique may be a viable path for the future.
The load of the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for different activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured when sitting than when standing.
So there is little objection to allowing patients whose spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
Additional ventral stabilization with bone shavings often significantly altered the load on bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often substantially higher after ventral stabilization.
A corset or bodice did not reduce the implant load.
Therefore, it is not necessary to use a brace for patients who have undergone mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningoma is one of the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningeoma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO Classification for Tumors of the Central Nervous System in 1993 and is intended to denote meningeomas with an increased propensity to recurrence compared to usual meningeomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningeoma as for the anaplastic meningeoma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
Using the morphometrically determined core area-based Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningeomas of all 3 grades (N=160), which proved to be valid compared to the “relapse”-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningomes are characterized by a little structured, “syncytial” growth pattern and large prominent nucleoles.
Optional nucleic pleomorphy, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, apart from the typical loss of chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningome showed distal loss of chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of cases.
Histochemically, we showed that the tissue-specific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structure is at 1p, can be used as a progression- and relapse-associated marker enzyme in meningeomas (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningeomas).
Instead of the term “atypical”, which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and may give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose that this group of tumors at risk of recurrence, which lies between the usual and the anaplastic meningoma be called intermediate-type meningoma.
Due to their special anatomical situation, joint progression fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures.
Computed tomography and MRI have greatly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment is in severely dislocated or luxated fractures.
The preauricular, sub- and perimandibular, retromandibular and oral approaches have been established as surgical access.
For fixation of the fragments, only functionally stable methods, such as the mini plate or pull screw, should be used.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with primarily focal liver lesions prior to liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basalomas as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing CSF Fowleri (Fowler’s);
Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as a side finding.
Background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely insufficiently represented in the established basic health services.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care system on the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The objective of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single primary care hospital.
Due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities, the PhotoDermVL allows a large selection of individually selectable treatment parameters.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential teleangiectasia, Naevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis collis, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, to identify risk factors related to the occurrence and to evaluate the benefit of early treatment of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in the acute relapse.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often difficult to control.
In addition, during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants, numerous treatment-induced adverse events occur.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which could hardly be controlled with high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
Both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to immunosuppression.
In both cases, the initial high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) were eliminated to minimal maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained immune to minimal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone for a follow-up period of 1 year.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is one of the most common symptoms in childhood.
However, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyria and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood light has been applied by the addition of fluorescence markers in the application control of topicals.
If hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced by programmed ventricular stimulation, endocardial mapping is possible.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circular excitation by means of stimulation maneuvers (“entrainment mapping”) and analysis of the “post-Pacing” interval.
In case of clinical occurrence and induction of single chamber tachycardia, an acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in approximately 60-70% of cases by radiofrequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is considerably lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
Recurrence is expected in about 20-30% of cases.
Early catheter ablation is indicated in incessant ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia following cardioverter defibrillator implantation.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is complementary to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method will be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rates was studied retrospectively in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma after conventional surgical interventions and R0 resection of the tumor.
In the univariate analysis we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, with a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
In the total population and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction of local recurrence rates in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of more precise tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically influenced factors, in particular total mesorectal excision for locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, there is a lack of uniform standards for documentation of findings.
However, these standards are necessary to allow comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings in order to meet the quality assurance requirements of echocardiography.
Declining incidences of active tuberculosis in developed countries have pushed the disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains the world’s most deadly infectious disease.
In developed countries, factors such as immigration, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, particularly as a result of the HIV epidemic, are helping to maintain a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Scarring pemphigoid (cicatricial pemphigoid, CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests itself on the skin and mucosa.
Ocular involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
As with other diseases, asymptomatic events in endocarditis are known (18, 19, 20, 21), but no clinical asymptomatic abdication has been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since it was first described increasingly affects areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 emerges in particular in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge to make IL-7 an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells and lymphoma cells in the upper skin layers.
In this overview, molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for possible applications of IL-7 in dermatology are outlined.
The suitability of high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, omniscan) for contrast-assisted magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumours was investigated and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present thesis aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, the first part outlines six research streams with relevance to everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative concept of everyday competence is presented, which integrates aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two models of everyday competence.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment could therefore potentially lead to significant advances in radio-oncology.
In a short overview the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
An inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during radiation therapy by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumour angiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its efficacy in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only method currently assured is to carry out radiotherapy in as short a total treatment time as possible, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned interruptions of treatment.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We studied 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within 1 hour of intake and at an interval of 4-24 hours for TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were observed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or re-acute coronary syndrome.Results:
The cumulative event rate in CRP and TnT positive patients at 42 days post-discharge was 62.5% compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
Logistic regression on the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (both at 4-24h), age, sex and diagnosis showed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, Odds Ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, Odds Ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for diagnosis AMI were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24h period.
In addition to Troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little use for acute infarction diagnosis.
However, the assessment of the prognosis of the patients by TnT is significantly supplemented independently by CRP 4-24h after intake and thus substantially improved.
A 51/2 year old girl with optic glioma and resulting internal hydrocephalus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content could be detected in the CSF and in the ascite fluid.
For the first time, the cause of the elevated CSF protein by CSF protein electrophoresis was found to be a disturbance of the blood-CSF barrier.
The ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary discharge with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, in liver damage with portal hypertension, the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion-dependent duct bleeding is increased.
While diagnosis is simple, different treatment options are available.
Usually the source of bleeding is in varicose-like enlarged vessels in the stoma, so local sclerosis with 3% ethoxysclerol or inhibition of the bleeding vessel is advisable.
Resection of the varicose conduit portion is an option in case of life-threatening bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, consideration should also be given to terminating the conduit.
A malignancy must be ruled out as a cause of every bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningoma and glioma are among the best genetically characterized solid tumors:
Species-specific, a number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known to be associated with clinical parameters such as the propensity to recurrence of meningeomas or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression, particularly in gliomas, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumour cells, which are also determined iatrogenically by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) 6 years earlier for mitral stenosis III.
Three years later, valve thrombosis occurred, requiring valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting single steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of cancer cells from the epithelial association by loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
Intravasation of tumor cells is facilitated by angiogenetic factors that may lead to degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastatic process.
Furthermore, a tumor cell will survive when it enters the circulation only if it evades the immunological defenses.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, and rarely in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
This gene is thought to belong to the tumor suppressor genes whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasms.
Tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus may metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 is most commonly manifested between the ages of 20 and 35, mainly by hyperparathyroidism and/ or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have addressed the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different donor tissue preservation methods.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic, since very variable follow-up intervals were summarized despite long known dynamic cell loss.
The aim of this study was to perform a long-term endothelial diagnosis at the same time, taking into account two different conservation techniques.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a different risk of perioperative thromboembolism, which requires continuation of prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of coagulation inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective surgery, the coumarin administration is stopped 2-3 days prior to surgery, in case of emergency surgery a vitamin K or Fresh Frozen plasma substitution is necessary.
Surgery in patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic, as the heparin effect resolves within a few hours upon discontinuation.
On the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany, results are available from various epidemiological studies.
When the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies are applied to the total population of Germany, estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients result.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient identification, epidemiological area and population structure.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by means of a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is that it is not possible to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent aggregation of the results of the survey of the individual physician groups revealed a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range of Poser et al.
127 excluding the diagnostic category “MS in question” and 170 including this diagnostic category.
The study examined how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
In order to achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which consequently produce more growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be seen as a promising new technique of in situ tissue engineering, with clinical application expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the family doctor.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of decisive importance for diagnosis and treatment.
While in the 1970s the conversation style of the doctor was regarded as a personality variant, recent empirical studies of doctor-patient conversation suggest that the conversation behavior of the doctor is understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversation behavior.
Training programmes to improve basic psychosomatic competence in general practitioners often show little success, as they do not sufficiently address the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is the focus of the Düsseldorf training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
The training concept as well as experiences with it are presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All of these sources have limited applicability to day-to-day clinical practice.
Programming the speech processor of a cochlear implant (CI) in young children, especially the determination of the stimulation volume corresponding to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation should be avoided as it may have traumatic effects on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and auditory thresholds established during postoperative speech processor adjustment in 27 patients of three different implant types.
It was examined whether the ESR threshold provides a practicable, objective tool for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants irritated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as a percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level over all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed in some cases large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometric method.
Therefore, a reliable and simple calculation of the MAL and the hearing threshold was not possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold may, in addition to an intraoperative functional check, contribute to a numerical limitation of the area to be checked.
However, the exact MALs will have to be determined by a different, for the time being, behavioral audiometric means.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red portions of a multicolored decorative tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was impressive, which could be distinguished from a true lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological studies.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be a consequence of dermal-allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
Therapy of choice is a surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the kidney by means of rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a chicken-egg-sized supernumerary gland protruding the skin had developed in the left anterior axial line during 8 years.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic surgery, damage to adjacent arterial vessels to the joint may occur.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complications are described as well as the applied therapy.
Vascular status of the extremities should be assessed before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
Delusions are intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency towards subjective certainty, which lose their alienating character as the object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusions arise are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to update, which weighs on the imagination and is increased in psychotic states, is a prerequisite of madness.
Added to this is the failure of de-actualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Reflections explained by a casuistry, which originate from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusions, are extended to other forms of delusions and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor is usually singular and is a benign tumor first described in the lung.
It describes the case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal respiratory impairment due to a thickening of the anterior septum.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was shown in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Based on an overview of the relevant literature, differential diagnoses are discussed.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we present possibilities for examining finger arteries and fingertip arteries in healthy subjects with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we used.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all subjects (n=10).
Furthermore, in a patient with endangiitis obliterans, it is shown that pathological variations in vessels of this magnitude can be detected with the appropriate equipment and examination technology.
The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the need for re-implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the lifetime of the first implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracal visualization systems allows the performance of operations on the mitral valve via a limited right anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role.
Preferred localizations are the stem and the limb proportions close to the stem.
By combining different imaging techniques, besides determining the size and extent of the tumor, the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to a few.
Whereas surgical resection had a monopoly position in earlier years, the importance of adjuvant therapy such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy is increasing.
Mutilating interventions and interventions resulting in loss of function are only justified in the event of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological baseline therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-oriented anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, system therapies are often used to support a rapid and effective response of topical therapy or to achieve a remission in treatment-resistant cases.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
An exacerbation can often be successfully countered by phototherapeutic measures, in particular by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutics such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can generally be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or is a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with a watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-focused nasal respiratory obstruction in the ENT department of the BwK Ulm for examination.
Clinical examination and CT of the sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently originated from the middle nasal duct.
The tumor was resected by midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological analysis revealed the diagnosis of a neuroma.
Based on this case study and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and treatment of this rare nasal tumor are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than during surgical therapy of lumbar disc prolapse, but they sometimes lead to significant impairments.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding and transverse myelitis.
This should be taken into account when indicating chemonucleolysis and when educating patients.
Six patients with eosinophilicum faciei granuloma, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
The granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low-stress treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative therapy to systemic treatment with Dapson.
Starting from the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counselling/liaison services, the effectiveness of psychosomatic dermatological counselling was investigated in greater detail in this study for the first time.
The degree of compliance by treatment recommendation was assessed and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as frequency of contact, pre-conception and satisfaction with consultation, and clinical and demographic characteristics was examined.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent out and medical records were evaluated.
A total sample of n=69 patients with a recommended course of action resulted in a compliance rate of 78.3%, compared to the subgroup with a recommended psychotherapy a rate of 69%.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic features, nor did the frequency of conversation contact influence.
In 70.5% of cases, only one conversation was conducted.
Compliance was promoted by a positive pre-attitude towards consultation and a pleasant experience of conversation.
Overall, high efficiency could be achieved with relatively little time and effort.
A 29-year-old patient with an unusual facial pigment mark has been reported.
Clinically, the pigment lesion corresponded to a Naevus spilus, histological diagnosis confirmed the existence of multiple blue Naevi, a weak lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cells showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change is thus shown to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require much more intraoperative fluid than would be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in Starling forces - in particular vascular permeability - may play a role here, but these have not yet been studied in detail.
Discussion of the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, especially on surgical complications, e.g. the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has in the past led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc windowing or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 1970s.
Results in patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results depending on the author and the study.
It is striking here that prospective randomized trials with comparator groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patients - are very rare.
Here, the results of intradiscal treatment procedures are often evaluated more critically and with lower success rates than the sometimes retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers but are not able to withstand rigid scientific criteria of the study design.
Overall, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can treat only a part of the lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At the present time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures need to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgery procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four locking systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their importance when used after coronary interventions.
Published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU ranged from 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
Hemostasis times are 5-13’, 2-4’, 11-19’ and 4-14’ with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems showed a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all of them documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of patients is mainly due to the removal of the lock immediately after coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by reducing the length of stay.
For the treatment of pervasive macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula of the presumed intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also removed the membrane limitans interna (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina for some time.
Clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomised studies comparing thrombolysis and Prim‰r dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left thigh block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, Pr‰hospital time >= 12 h, or unknown Pr‰hospital time.
To describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and Prim‰r dilation, we examined the data from the Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died 5 days after the onset of first symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis in liver coma.
The serological diagnosis revealed a cured hepatitis A, a persistent hepatitis B, a hepatitis C and a superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis was only detected postmortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (over day) in the pulmonary stream with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
The tau protein in the cerebrospinal CSF was measured in 40 Alzheimer patients, 5 patients with other dementias and 36 cognitively unremarkable controls.
Of the Alzheimer patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (sum score of 25 to 28 points in the mini-mental state test).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these patients compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer’ s patients, there was no quantitative association between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficiency as measured by SPECT.
The results indicate that tau may also be elevated in the pre-demential stage of Alzheimer’s disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
Over the past decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustular dermatitis, especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophil pustulations were imposing.
This paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosization remains a major problem after reconstructive vascular procedures.
Proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) may also contribute to restenation by prolonging intimate cell survival resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples from 25 primary and 14 residual arsenic lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were tested using the TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with Re than primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
The main finding of this study was that hypercellular residual nase tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological characteristics for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
However, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two types of platelets (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data point to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying form of cell death with differences between the two lesion types in significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimate hyperplasia, as is usually detected in human restenoses after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T-cell and natural killer cell lymphomas that may manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
The clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphocytes are described in detail.
The current incidence of microbial (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is estimated at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been rising steadily for years.
The prognosis depends largely on a rapid confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the most diagnostic clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the termination of ill-targeted antibiotic therapy and a review of the blood culture techniques used, or the use of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potentiating toxic effects are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetation at the mitral valve is associated with a high risk of thromboembolism and is usually an indication for surgery in its own right, especially when the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg/ml.
In the first three weeks after manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolism is associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolism is not a contraindication to cardiopulmonary surgery if a primary cerebral haemorrhage has been excluded by a cranial CT scan and the surgery is performed early before the development of post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hrs).
Significant improvement in prognosis by early surgical intervention is also demonstrated for disease progression complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially in the wake of acute valve insufficiency), the occurrence of acute renal failure, a replicate infection of primary aortic valve vegetation onto the anterior mitral sail, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
Transvaginal ultrasound is particularly good for examining the embryonic brain, since the large, “cystic” ventricles of the brain can be imaged relatively easily.
Sononembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of abnormalities.
2. Changes in the appearance of the cerebral ventricles with a disproportion of the areas of the brain in which there is either an increased or decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act puts the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
Certain illnesses in case of suspicion, illness or death have to be reported (mainly by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates the information to be provided by the persons obliged to report.
It also specifies what information may be forwarded by the public health authority.
Particularly in the case of reports of suspicions or reports of detection of pathogens, not all the information to be transmitted is already available in the notification, and the public health authority must therefore carry out its own investigations in order to be able to transmit the relevant information.
The health authorities are also responsible for consolidating incoming notifications from doctors and laboratories and for forwarding them as individual notifications.
For this purpose, case definitions have been developed.The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which facilitates the compilation of mandatory data for the public health office.
The transmission to the RKI is then made via the competent regional authority designated by the Land.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumor cases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer sufferers usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions, which lead to a significant loss of quality of life if treatment is inadequate or absent.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his/her family members.
Although various organisations have therapeutic concepts for an adequate treatment of pain, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a decisive cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the retikoendothelial system, liver diseases lead to decreased values of hepatic synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis.
Compensated haemostasis disorders do not usually require symptomatic treatment of the haemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by different noxes, clinically usually bleeding occurs with more or less consumption coagulpathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like conditions and only exceptionally thromboembolism.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after seamless corneal cataract surgery.
As part of fall prevention, a routine review of medication is required.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age, the frequency of prescribing medicines that may increase the risk of falling through the possible induction of dizziness was investigated.
Between the individual cardiac centers, the amount of bleeding differs up to 8-fold from the same mediastinal drainage after cardiac surgery in adults.
Excessive post-bleeding results in an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the rate of transfusion of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
The use of allogeneic transfusions will be reduced by avoidance of preoperative anaemia, tolerance of low haemoglobin, use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol.
The perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this objective in 1989 with persistent dedication and great effort.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussing the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Today, at the end of the 20th century, MCT surgery is recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with approximately 3800 specialists.
Otomycosis, especially after topical antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, the transfer of fungi to the middle ear can lead to serious complications.
Therefore, preoperative rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is absolutely necessary.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous Miconazole solution.
Three comparator solutions, “E 153” (3), a full electrolyte solution for intravenous infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), two balanced solutions developed for eye surgery, were evaluated for their possible influence on the postoperative inflammatory course after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The median age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilatative cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and surviving ventricular fibrillation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
Twenty-five patients received implantation of a subcutaneous patch or array system, two patients received an epicardial patch system, 92 patients received implantation site abdominal and 248 pectoral implantation site.
Thirty-three patients (9.7%) experienced a total of 34 probation-related complications.
Eighteen of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of tube-related complications was 3 times higher for dual-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators (12%) than for single-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators (4%) (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray, a quarter (24%) were diagnosed clinically (inadequate treatment delivery, pain) and a fifth (21%) were diagnosed by electrical parameters.
The efficacy of radiosynoviorthesis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, particularly chronic polyarthritis, has been evaluated.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not mechanically rotate an X-ray tube around the patient. Instead, an electron beam is directed to targets arranged semicircularly around the patient, where the actual X-ray radiation is generated.
With this ultra-fast technique, it has become possible to generate axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to accurately map all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution of <0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cross-sectional images (layer thickness 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient’s heart.
The detection of coronary lime with EBT must be regarded as the most sensitive non-invasive marker at present for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen under the assumption of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artefacts as well as overlapping of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive images of coronary arteries have already become possible with EBT, which may be further optimized by further technological advances.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become established over the past 25 years as the vessel of choice.
In addition to the established method of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for examining this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients showed a consistent test result compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile according to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle is dominated by a high systolic proportion, a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial current bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flow proportion.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracal duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularization result postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male hypertensive patients over 60 years of age, characteristically with cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmatic dissections of intracranial arteries are a distinct rarity.
Young patients with or without a history of immediate trauma predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the A. cerebri media in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmatic dissection of intracranial arteries are discussed.
The article shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old people’s homes and nursing homes.
The adaptation should strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and accelerate the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposedly ideal models; rather, it is up to the governing bodies to develop and implement solutions specific to their home, taking into account the respective framework conditions.
It is reported that a phenotypically female newborn of the 37th SSW died under the picture of renal insufficiency on the 14th day of life.
The child had a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis of Drash Syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been one of the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality in Western industrialized countries.
While accidents in older children and adolescents usually occur on the road and are consistently recorded and documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and toddler age, which mainly occur during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the efficacy of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accidental hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
Two cases (females, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoidal cysts have been reported, resulting in long-term lumbar complaints.
In both cases there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
Clinical use of this method is delayed, on the one hand, by the difficulty of image analysis and, on the other hand, by the fact that conventional techniques are capable of imaging only one layer per heartbeat.
New developments in both magnetic resonance tomographs and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion across the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echoplanar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results presented in an infarct patient.
The clinical benefit of MRI-assisted determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is enhanced by the variety of MRI methods used to determine cardiac function parameters.
Since the circulation conditions in ligament ruptures are an important parameter, especially with regard to the prospects of success of surgical care, the present study should describe the vascularization of the knee ligament.
The special blood circulation situation was examined by microangiography on 21 cadaveric specimens.
There was a proximal supply of 1 or 2 main vessel strains, which were preferentially located in the ventral portions of the band.
Vascular density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal parts of the band, we would recommend the reconstruction of the band by means of fibrin bonding, which allows an atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture-related vessel strangulation.
Every year, approximately 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease (approximately 75% of all cardiac operations) are treated surgically in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, predominantly the vena saphena magna, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive venous removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, yet today saphenectomy is mostly performed by means of continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for the open preparation of the vena saphena magna.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up after coronary surgery and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive harvesting techniques.
The presented technique (modified “bridge” technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only slight limitation caused by the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal part of the major pectoralis muscle, an ipsilateral symbrachydactylia and occasionally associated further defects of the thoracic wall, breast and breast.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of joint occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described.
We’re reporting another patient with this rare combined malformation.
The purpose of this study was to assess whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels can predict sepsis at an early stage and the severity of sepsis.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the different journals and publishers vary considerably in quality and quantity.
In contrast to traditional publications, online publications offer many advantages, such as low production costs and fast availability of information regardless of location or time.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the printed versions, but will be a useful addition to the existing information offer.
We report about a 61-year-old patient who had developed the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a “police assault”.
The present case study describes the case of a 52 year old patient who developed a second‰re aortoenteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The pr‰operative diagnosis was made by an upper endoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography.
The value of pre‰operative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical therapy methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not currently performed in Germany.
According to opponents of the PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents are of the opinion that, from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude a PGD.
In view of this situation, a PGD has not yet been implemented in Germany.
The debate, which has been raging in Germany for some time, is difficult to communicate in academic circles abroad.
On the basis of case studies it was assumed that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracal pus focal point.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective clinical study.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unclear origin (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C on at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of hospitalization.
A quarter of these cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden abscedations, endocarditis lenta, and tuberculosis.
In this thesis, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
With the help of a fast-curing plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, impressions of the skin are made that correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent metrological procedure the “roughness” of the skin print is measured with the “Profilometer” and the result is recorded as a diagram.
Measurement data can be analyzed, stored and compared by means of a statistical program.
We tested this method to detect possible improvements in the skin surface after the application of estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The ratio of water distribution between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the Guidelines for Blood Alcohol Testing for Forensic Purposes for the Conversion of Serum Alcohol into Blood Alcohol.
In a large multicenter study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the population in which blood samples are ordered in connection with offences under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases, the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. In 96% of cases, the difference in the ratio was less than 3%.
Paradoxical embolism is well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right-atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect is typically underlying.
Polymorphic diseases of children that change during growth through reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A meaningful comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible by the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
Vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission by palpation of wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity and Doppler signal derivation via wrist arteries.
The emergency operations performed in all 10 children involved the first step repositioning and fixation of fragments with crossed K-wires via a track-side access.
Subsequent assessment of blood flow revealed a recurrence of pulse (transient, dislocation-induced vascular occlusion) in 2 of the 10 children.
In 8 of the 10 children the pulse remained absent, so the vessel had to be explored as a matter of urgency.
Intraoperatively, we observed a vascular spasm with functional vascular closure in 1 of these 8 children.
In adventitious strangulations (2 of these 5 children), pulse transfer to the hand occurred immediately after separation of the connective strangulating tissue.
In the case of intimate injuries (3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with venous patch plastic.
Combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) was observed in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination, wrist pulses could be sampled in 9 children, color duplex sonography showed a physiological signal, 1 child showed a pathological, monophasic signal above the A. brachialis, A. radialis and A. ulnaris.
Ischemic late damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not observed in any of the children.
Assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and a lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The supporting joint axis was normal in all children in the side comparison.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to paediatricians, as the pathogen is cultivated only in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced deep-lying tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--tocopherol acetate) against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg) was evaluated in hospitalized patients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and diclofenac (n=43) showed a marked improvement in all clinical parameters studied.
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90 min to 68 min with vitamin E therapy and from 68 min to 30 min with diclofenac.
The Ritchie joint index decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac), respectively.
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E and diclofenac groups.
There was also a marked reduction in pain severity in both groups, as measured by a 10cm visual analog scale.
The overall judgement of the physician and patient on the treatment success was similar for the two medicinal products.
Especially in view of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high doses of vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even overblown if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the neonate is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary anterior anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicyst pulmonary processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal pulp and by a Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic was repeatedly exposed to severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol) as a result of intoxications with synthetic drugs (“ecstasy” and “speed”) within a few weeks.
In patients with decompensated diabetic metabolism (initial HbA1c 11.7%), insulin injections were not administered under the influence of drugs.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours without adequate hydration at a techno-party at the time of manifestation of the first ketoacidosis.
In addition to desiccosis and tachycardia, the clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms;
Disturbances of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and delusions of persecution are mainly related to drug intoxication.
Treatment consisted of intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The course was straightforward.
A case of ball variance of a smeloff cutter prosthesis in aortic position is reported 24 years after implantation.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone-rubber ball of the prosthesis showed pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, grooves and cracking with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal dysfunction of the prosthesis with complete valve thrombosis.
In a prospective study, 36 patients were treated for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus roll by outpatient arthroscopy and monitored according to a standardized protocol at 4 and 12 months.
Conventional preliminary radiological examinations were found to provide information on the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the herd were located in the dorsal portions of the talus roll, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, puncture of the tibia or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy in concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes at the anterior tibia edge.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation duration and the objective and subjective good surgical results make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle.
Acute heart failure includes decompensated chronic heart failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former should be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while pulmonary oedema should be treated with greater therapeutic effort.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, different mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
However, the mortality of cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study of 31 subjects, cognitive impairment following a single oral therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam was quantitatively measured using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT).
The disorders were, in part, consistent with the clinical picture of moderate to severe transient syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia with no tendency to brighten occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident in the evidence of a coarse rotary hystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after administration of midazole.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and diagnostic distribution and videoconferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a high-quality representation of the extracranial carotid current pathway in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be displayed without contrast agents.
The use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) allows first-pass carotid imaging from the aortic arch to the base of the skull with intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium in less than 30 s.
In this paper the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-assisted MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast agent (KM) injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively fast blood reflux from the venous sinus into the jugular vein must be considered.
First, the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries was determined using a model and a computer simulation.
It was found that 90 % of the contrast is defined in the middle 16 % of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By stepwise variation of site resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on test subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid current pathway.
The best qualitative results were obtained with a double-dose technique at a 2 ml injection rate.
The temporal reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further studies on the optimal application of KM at the very early state of the art are still pending.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Post-operative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, early initiation of a programme of exercise and regular clinical monitoring.
Based on the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after anterior cruciate ligament operations can be largely avoided if these measures are taken into account.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasia, surgical treatment options play an important role.
Restoring the passage, ensuring the discharge of secretions and reducing pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative therapeutic options.
In many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospitalisation can be avoided.
The present thesis describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the sick elderly is one of the most common and under-reported diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population studied, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60 % is reported.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, to a lack of energy and, in combination, to general malnutrition.
For an accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is useful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These allow a customized nutritional therapy.
The main deficiencies in the elderly are protein, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, causes enormous health costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
The rapid increase in the number of elderly people will exacerbate the problem of malnutrition.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention by taking it seriously as a disease in its own right and integrating it into the curriculum of the training of doctors and nurses.
The Cox multivariate hazard analysis shows ELND as an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor localization and gender of the tumor carrier.
According to Kaplan Meier, the observed survival curves “with” and “without ELND” differ significantly in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, thorax and acre;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization and >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of arms, legs and abdomen (except acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the risk range with a prognostic benefit can be further defined by testing specific risk constellations taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Applicants for driving licences are required not only to have adequate eyesight, but also, legally, to “reliable use”.
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, adopting a head-gazing posture or using other compensatory mechanisms.
According to the applicable investigation guidelines (Appendix XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO), these are precisely not permitted.
Eruptive cellular cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retined cellular hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retinated keratin and numerous velus hairs.
In spite of some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent disease patterns.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be imaged histologically using Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, partly ulcerated nodes.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen may also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA with multiple cutaneous nodes and bone changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in resolution of all symptoms of the disease.
Stabilisation and spondylodesis of the ventral column were performed by thoracoscopic technique in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries.
Due to increased experience, surgical times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open-label procedure.
Our own experience proves the basic feasibility of a minimally invasive treatment.
Significant advantages over the open method are a reduced onset morbidity, a reduced need for painkillers, an early functional recovery and a shorter inpatient stay.
Surgery goal Exercise stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid, intramedullary interlocking marrow nail in a non-drilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to constriction of the subacromial space is considered to be a possible cause of the supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumereal distances and for the assessment of the acromion shape in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
Acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion form was compared with the Bigliani classification in conventional X-ray imaging.
The term “primary chronic osteomyelitis” is used to summarize a number of diseases which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, no pathogen can be detected in the second group.
Particularly the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to relapse, have a long course and may also show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumors and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
Histological differentiation between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis does not exist.
Social work for older people is not justified per se in a demographically ageing society, but must prove its usefulness to society in the changing conditions of the changing age structure.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and has triggered the search for a consensus-based and more attractive performance profile in the fields of social work for the elderly.
Using the direct immunofluorescence method, we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L chains, an early component of complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along the elastic fibers obtained in the dermis, especially in the papillary stratum, at the dermoepidermal boundary, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands, and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this respect, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extremely exposed in daily use and thus also exposed to a high degree of injury.
The manifold functions of the hand require vitality and sensitivity as well as undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of severe injuries, only residual or replacement functions can often be obtained.
Complex trauma of the hand results in a combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
Basically, the aim is to provide comprehensive primary care.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is in the foreground.
As far as possible, the destroyed tissue is primarily reconstructed.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced by a stalked or free micro-surgical skin flap.
In the case of long ischemia, this concept is abandoned insofar as blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented clearly.
In the healing result of a complex hand injury, every function of the hand that has been recovered or created counts.
It is therefore unreasonable to provide such a serious injury to a specialized department without the necessary knowledge and staffing and local conditions.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large randomized trials with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, under PTCA, the number of re-interventions is significantly higher.
In the long term after the BARI study in diabetic patients, lethality was lower in the surgical group.
The individual treatment recommendation by the treating physician has also been shown to be an important factor in the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of newer techniques (stents) is being investigated in further large-scale randomized studies.
A 34-year-old patient with rare disease history of variegated parakeratosis has been reported following acute lichenoides and varioliformis pityriasis after a period of 4 years.
We performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases and their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the T-cell type.
While both diseases exhibited characteristic histological changes and a predominantly lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor could not be assured within both changes.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without reference to the low malignant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement of the location of a suspected tumor lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resecta edge (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and unambiguous as possible.
We report about 2 technical aids which, according to our experience, are particularly useful for breast excised products:
1) Radiopacic filaments, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
Contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthetic circuit produces compound A, which may have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been carried out in volunteers to investigate the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
Three studies investigated the effects of 8 hours of anaesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3 vol.%, using fresh gas fluxes of approx. 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from renal tubular cells in the urine of subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent studies then found either no or no changes in renal excretion of these renal function parameters.
Another study also investigated 3 vol.% sevoflurane administered for 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min in volunteers.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In any event, the application of these results to clinical practice must take into account the experimental nature of the anaesthesia carried out in these studies.
Although the subject of low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, studies in volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical investigations, suggest that renal function after surgery under low-flow conditions is similar to that of isoflurane.
So far, there are no published experiences in the treatment of paraphilias (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in the German-speaking countries.
In this study we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate during a 12-month study period.
During the treatment period, there was no further sexual aggression and patients reported significant reductions in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
A patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its potential carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we investigated five different intraoperative heat measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and colleagues first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapuls CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
Today, the diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is possible by phlebography as well as by duplex sonography with almost 100% certainty.
It is linked to the high level of qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both methods are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has become extremely important due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography is indispensable.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the use of the two procedures is a “golden partnership” when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
Chronic rejection is the most important unresolved problem in kidney transplantation today.
The objective of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we investigated 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in-situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromer-specific DNA probes for the human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which consist primarily of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the double sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Association as one of the methods that shortened the waiting time for the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey should be conducted to determine the extent to which Doppler Sonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision aid to determine brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positives had occurred, “yes” was ticked 5 times.
The meeting revealed that the examiners deliberately reported borderline situations where the conditions were sometimes not fully met.
In none of these cases was ultrasound used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not insignificant number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially for the further confirmation of the diagnosis, less often than the sole method to shorten the waiting time.
Only the microsomal hemoxygenase (HO) is responsible for the endogenous formation of CO, which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducing isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
Therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducing isoform of the enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was investigated.
Glycerin leads to the transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the horny lipids into liquid crystalline states.
Particularly when used in O/W emulsion, it improves the horny layer hydration to a considerable extent and clearly exceeds the urea effect.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and hence the depletion of the horny layer.
particularly during long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be increased by glycerin.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerol-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerin also has a protective effect against surfactants and lipophilic pollutants.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerin leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers the barrier regeneration.
Finally, similar to urea, glycerin can lead to improved drug penetration.
Operational objective Operational objective Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by means of a posterior bone block and capsule plastic.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to prolonged surgery times and increased surgical trauma when multiple arterial grafts are used, these have only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletalization of arterial conduits-graft configuration).
Materials and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multi-vascular disease were completely arterially revascularized in our clinic.
All surgeries were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic arteries, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracic artery and radial artery, and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%) both arterial grafts were implanted in T-configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels per patient were anastomosed.
The hospital fatality rate was 2%.
Star wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
There were no complications following removal of the radial artery, except for temporary paraesthesia.
In the angiographic control 1 week postoperative, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenosis >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-Graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment procedures for periprosthetic thigh fractures following endoprosthetic knee replacement are discussed.
A new method of treatment of such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has acquired a key position in neuromonitoring, although the brain pressure does not allow the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron to be registered directly or only with a time delay.
A prerequisite for reliable brain pressure measurement is the specific properties of brain pressure probes, which will be investigated in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functioning and measurement properties.
Partial sphincterectomy is performed as part of cataract surgery with very narrow pupils (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosation ring of the sphincter pupillae muscle.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly being researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In this thesis, published papers on the topic of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to research priorities and methods.
The overview shows that empirical studies are scarce so far, and the available instruments for measuring the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are needed in order to be able to use the measurement of the quality of life of children in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
Seven of these patients were assessed during the last 5 days prior to onset of acute renal failure and compared to a control group.
In 1957, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasio due to skin changes, which must be considered as incipient rhinophymal based on the available biographical material.
Throughout his entire creative phase, the artist’s preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the nasal area, can be demonstrated.
As a founder of Pop Art, Warhol’s body of work significantly shaped modern society and influenced our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen) developed especially for the 3D visualization of the liver was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extended liver resections and live liver donations.
Experience with the program is available so far for >50 volumetric data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After active non-specific immunotherapy has positively influenced the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves gene transfer, which may be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, there are:
Vaccination with tumour-specific HLA-associated antigens using peptides or naked DNA, vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells in vivo with a tumour suppressor agent whose dysfunction is central to melanoma.
The influence of distortionary tendencies (“defence”) of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results could not be accurately assessed.
In 309 patients hospitalized with conversational psychotherapy and re-examined one year later, the extent to which CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES can be influenced by patient defence attitudes as measured by the validity scales of the MMPI-K, FPI-R and casting tests:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light (“social desirability”) and the tendency to appear unobtrusive-normal.
Their relative improvements (strength of effect rating scales) are smaller as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient conversational psychotherapy strengthened the defense in aggravating patients and reduced it in dissimulating patients.
In spite of early conservative and then timely surgical therapy of the congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported about 25%.
The main cause appears to be lack of concentric repositioning and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual clump feet (patients < 10 years) the age-dependent surgical procedure is presented.
After the 8th to 10th year of age, metatarsal osteotomies, the correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator and as the ultimate ratio triple arthrodesis are used.
Nevic cell nevi show marked variability in their clinical morphs.
We report about a 77-year-old patient with a stilted lobular intradermal nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-shaped appearance we suggest the expression “Nevus corymbiformis”.
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (explosion of costs in the transfusion system, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine is a challenge for anaesthetists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anaesthesia procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and automatic autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow to avoid transfusion of allogeneic blood even in patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Birth House and the Midwifery Institute, is regarded as one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He directed research and teaching to the empirically tangible.
His main work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determining the pelvic dimensions and inspecting the Michaelis rhombus named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
His research was characterized by honesty and conscientiousness:
Self-critically, he published medical failures and critically examined new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm the doctrine of Semmelweis on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
In 1848, in despair over the death of many patients in childbirth, he chose suicide.
In one case, the tumor is probably responsible for a long-known excitation conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can induce temporary stimuli in circumscribed cortex areas in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions concerning language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and experience to date, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and safety recommendations are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that occur mostly in the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow extratemporally and are then noticed extracranially as a space requirement.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial palsy.
The patient suffered from diffuse dizziness, progressive acoustic disturbance on the left and mild peripheral facial palsy without deficiency in tear secretion.
The neuroma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Using an extradural “middle fossa approach” the tumor was removed without injury to the motor facial nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neuroma of the N. petrosus major without affection of the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) occurs when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures between which the patient fails to regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients; if not, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
The treatment-refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternatively active substances.
For the treatment of an outdated rupture of the tendon of the anterior tibialis muscle, either a tendon transplantation or tendon transplantation is recommended.
A case study describes the surgical treatment with an augmented reversal plastic;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively free of symptoms with good functional results.
The reverse plastic has the advantage that there are no functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance conveys valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies in many diseases.
To measure this parameter in intensive care patients, the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies, serve primarily.
On the other hand, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis of chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the significance of these diseases.
Sepsis and MODS, which are particularly relevant for intensive care, are also associated with impairment of autonomic function as measured by reduction of heart rate variability.
Limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is indicative of loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction (“uncoupling of biological oscillators”).
This idea seems to be gaining in attractiveness in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report about 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the head hair.
The medical history showed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
Examination of the hair using atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
On the basis of our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic association of this exogenous hair discoloration with the uptake of copper by swimming water in indoor swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different points in time after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint sheet, assessment of the global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measurements were presented as median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of patients with terminal heart failure rated their quality of life as very poor;
6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of the transplant patients felt their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and their state of health (80%).
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients showing a high level of satisfaction with their health condition and 51% with their physical performance.
Although patients rated their mental health as good before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 months postop.
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure time activities improved in only about 28% of patients after HTx.
90% suffered from one or more symptoms after transplantation, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with end-stage heart failure, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental health, are significantly improved as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant patients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated skull-brain trauma (SHT) after a bicycle accident with a base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and a bruised hemorrhage [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-demanding hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values necessitated a barbiturate coma for 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic lung failure on the 8th day after trauma.
The patient showed a prolonged course and could not be transferred to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive restriction of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction/ adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
Ankylosing heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV) was shown in the pelvic overview and computed tomography.
Two years after the accident, the HOs were removed twice via a Smith-Petersen access.
HO recurrence prophylaxis was performed by a single preoperative radiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/ day) for 3 months.
The extent of movement at the hip joints is 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/ adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO.
The patient can work as a farmer for 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers “TR1” and “TR2” flank a 581 bp sequence within the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
PCR was used to amplify the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, as well as those of some yeast and mold fungi.
Hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides allowed the identification of dermatophytes and candida albicans.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the dermatophytes to be distinguished from the yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of the PCR for fungi was tested using human DNA from 42 dermal and epidermal samples as well as selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routine skin and nail samples were analyzed using PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected by PCR in 35 and by culture in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of decisive importance.
Injuries to the ulnar discus and the scapholunary ligament are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis has been increasingly used in forensic medicine, archaeology, evolutionary and population genetic studies over the past decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special attention to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biology studies is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work with the aim of obtaining mitochondrial DNA from soil-based teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases that could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis are presented.
The aim of this paper is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as our own observations.
Microperimetric examinations after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The surgical effort has to be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging intraarticular structures and surrounding soft tissues of joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labral lesions of the hip joint.
The MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows the direct representation of labral lesions by distending the joint space and marking the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow the assessment of the crucial cranioventral sections.
The labral lesions can be classified into different clinically relevant stages using the MRA.
In addition, the representation of accompanying lesions (intra- and extraossary ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
In the more than 100 arthrographs that have been performed, no complications have occurred so far.
Based on these experiences, the MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labral lesions.
In this review we present the technique and results of our MRA method.
It was found that the varicose wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the wall below a still intact venous valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the summary of the mechanical experiments and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and the subsequent varicose transformation of the vein cannot be confirmed, rather the first result is a change in the vein wall and thus also a valve insufficiency.
Injuries to the arteries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be missing in the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries.
Hypothenary hammer syndrome represents a closure of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually creeping and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven therapeutic recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the mid-term regulation of ocular pressure after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combination of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol results in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anaesthetic agents or techniques.
This article shows how the advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol can be best exploited.
The possible effect of propofol on the cerebri cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in terms of reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined maxillofacial and prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless maxillary by a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants is rarely included in the preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept for 23 patients was determined on the basis of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging with special attention to the anterior aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results achieved.
Profile prognosis with video imaging is a useful decision aid in planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors such as the extent of maxilla forward displacement, the insertion direction of enossal implants and the type of superconstruction.
Large-nodal multicenter juvenile xanthogranuloma has been reported, which was initially undiagnosed due to unusual clinical and histological aspects.
Spontaneous regression lasting more than 2 years with the change from the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells and the lack of detection of specific cell organelles confirmed the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations are offered on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of diseases of the rheumatic circuit.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with flawed and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as studies that do not allow scientifically substantiated statements due to the short duration of the study and the small number of patients.
A medically justifiable treatment recommendation for thymus preparations in rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be derived on this basis with a sufficient, positive benefit-risk assessment according to the current state of knowledge, taking into account the potential risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the A. hepatica dextra in a 64 year old patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhages had occurred up to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to identify in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising treatment option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insults have shown that optimal conditions exist when early symptoms of stroke are recognized quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 hours of the onset of initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
Symptoms are not noticed or minimized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number is to be achieved by intensified training, taking into account both the general public and emergency medical personnel.
The standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, management of blood pressure, and treatment of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance treatment with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine tablet form was compared with oral methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a 24-week study period.
In the randomized study, retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the study program over the entire duration and completed the study as planned), add-on use and duration of stay were defined as endpoints.
At a mean daily dose of buprenorphine of 7.3 mg and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a trend in retention rate (p=0.06) in favor of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) tended to be higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
There was no significant difference between opiate, benzodiazepine and cocaine add-on use during the course of treatment.
Methadone was the more successful drug in terms of duration of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional therapeutic failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal cancer for the likelihood of occurrence of haematogenic metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined for clinical parameters, reflex allergy, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
Twenty-nine patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients a radical neck dissection was performed following the completion of radiotherapy according to the treatment concept.
10/ 139 patients were subsequently treated with “opération de rattrappage”.
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%), the condition was controlled locoregionally.
The tumor was uncontrolled in 62/ 139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumours, were similar in Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and number of concurrent chemotherapy cycles.
Tumour control was significantly influenced by reflex totalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time for patients with locoregional treatment failure was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of locally controlled patients were still alive.
Remote metastases were detected in 23% (14/ 62) of locoregionally uncontrolled patients, compared to only 4/ 77 (5%) of locoregionally cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and remote metastasis, most commonly pulmonary metastases, reached a plateau at 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indication of the likelihood of distant metastases.
Failure of therapy has its root in the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume detection and spatial and time resolution in CT is reached.
However, the new technical capabilities of MDCT require a redefinition of investigation strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated for symptoms and current treatment of viper bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening oedema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of serious poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive procedures on the distal stretching apparatus of the knee.
The MPT fixator was applied to 44 patients in assembly form A and 23 patients in assembly form B.
In 4 patients, a deep infection occurred, in 2 cases due to the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator carried the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patelectomy and transossary refixation of the lig. patellae in caudal rupture fractures and 12 patients with transossary seam fixation of the lig. patellae in tear and tear at the lower patella pole or suture adaptation of the lig. patellae in case of intraligamentary rupture in which no other restorations were performed on the knee joint other than the stretching apparatus operation.
In 2 patients the outcome was considered normal, in 10 patients almost normal and in 4 patients abnormal based on the IKDC score.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a force deficit of 10-20% in the stretch muscles of the operated leg compared to the opposite side.
In conclusion, the EPTT with the MPT-fixator has proven itself in continuity-restoring interventions on the distal stretching apparatus of the knee joint and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial crushing with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic disorders of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Today, newer diagnostic options as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies that have been tested in clinical trials.
Based on the case history of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous hemorrhagic vesicles recur acutely into adulthood at the beginning of the light-rich season and recur into adulthood.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central type of image in the X-ray diagnostics of oral, maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic layer image.
Further reductions in dose requirements have been made possible by developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or storage films.
Diagnostic shortcomings of conventional imaging methods make imaging by means of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in many clinical problems of oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery unavoidable.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suited for soft tissue diagnostics, due to the shortening of the measuring times, it now also allows the imaging of changes in the cortical system.
For certain questions, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures allow imaging-assisted functional analysis.
Today, body-oriented psychotherapy is used both inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are particularly important for patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are emotionally restricted or, due to character resistance, who are hard to reach in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with short examples and other methods are indicated.
Among the factors mentioned are the connection of the affect to the vegetative and arbitrary nervous system as well as the close connection of psychological and physical processes, particularly at the beginning of life, which is linked to the form of interaction experienced in each case and has psychobiological effects.
In the further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important importance for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are highlighted.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideals and family reality, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
Role and function in one’s family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic activity leaves a lot of scope for individuals to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still difficult for psychotherapists in particular to implement a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one’s own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention in their education and training to their personal relationships as to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
Advanced heart failure is gaining increasing importance in the cardiovascular patient population with a prevalence of 0.1%.
The probability of survival for 6 to 12 months is significantly reduced at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice for drug-refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive list for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical therapeutic approaches have developed.
Conventional drug therapy was improved by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anti-congestive beta-blockers.
The surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assist hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastic, cardiomyoplasty and multi-site pacing.
These treatment options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
Treatment success depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registries.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Bochum, the availability of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapeutic procedures in the period of one year.
In contrast, 122 manual therapeutic handles were performed at HWS, BWS and LWS by the respective ward physicians with completed further training.
While TLA focused on the primary site of the disease (pseudo-radicular HWS and LWS), manual therapy focused on adverse events in other levels of the spine in patients with the above-mentioned diagnoses or with post-discotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated mandible tooth from the site of its implantation to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of migration of a retinal lower premolar to the muscular process documented over a period of 14 years.
Migration along the ascending mandible rust to the muscle progression took place after completion of root growth, after the patient’s 20th year of age.
There were no specific radiological or clinical reasons for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer as well as cases that can be treated by means of radical prostate veiculectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the classification of stages and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Due to the lack of a standardized method for processing the preparations internationally, the comparability of different scientific studies is difficult.
The well-defined and rational classification of preparations that we are proposing is intended to remedy these problems and to help improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The surge in requirements for documentation, performance measurement, efficiency and quality control, necessitates the use of computer tools in the clinic.
In the Orthopaedic Clinic of Justus Liebig University, Giessen, a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the statutory requirements, particular attention has been paid to the clinical-scientific requirements of clinically active physicians.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, surgical planning (termination of procedures, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinical communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server into MedXS, content and functions can be accessed simultaneously from the intranet or the Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
The use of the application has significantly simplified clinical procedures and created far better conditions for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by nonspecific neurological symptoms and especially facial dysmorphia.
However, the presence of congenital leukodermias (Piebaldism, Partial Albinism) is considered to be relatively typical and usually trend-setting.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is an important cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially in young patients.
Treatment of ventricular tachycardia and prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death are at the forefront of therapy.
Individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM have manifest heart failure and are treated with medication according to standard treatment guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method for examining a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary replacement of patella in the context of total knee prosthetics is still very controversial in general.
In this context, we need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in the prosthetic environment than only compared to the prosthetic patella.
The fact that we have been performing patella replacement only in special cases for almost 5 years has provided us with a patient record on which to study this question.
On the basis of 30 fully prosthetic knees documented with a 2-year follow-up, we carried out a targeted elevation of the patellash lift and tilt, first focused on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patella placement bearing, and compared the results with the range of motion achieved after 2 years and the persistence of pain symptoms.
Regularly an adaptation of the bony patella silhouette to the prosthesis plain bearing was observed with compaction of the peripheral bone contact zone with or without fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were assigned to a “residual problem group” based on their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or motility of only 90//0 degree flexion/ extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift greater than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt greater than 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility correlated with a severe preoperative shift, also with a significant difference from the problem-free group.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial loosening.
After an axis-corrective change of the tibial components, this patient again became pain-free and well-movable, without any surgical measure having been performed on the patella and despite the fact that a considerable residual tilt remained.
Thus, it is obvious that for the re-centering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm a greater effort seems justified:
In addition to common surgical steps that favorably influence the course of the kneecap during implantation, a high quadriceps displacement or medially staggered refixation of the detached tuberositas may be required.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the non-prosthetically supplied patella exhibits an astonishing ability to adapt to the prosthetic plain bearing by remodelling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative malposition, in which we had not performed a replacement due to good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized kneecaps.
Whether in such cases there is an extended indication for the replacement of patella remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the quality assurance publications of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
By introducing comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be increased measurably.
Improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing hospital structures.
Up to now, measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes have been in the foreground.
To increase employee satisfaction and qualifications, rehabilitation-specific training series were conducted.
New forward-looking perspectives were developed together with other partners.
Operational objective Avoidance or elimination of compression on the nerve structures.
The present thesis gives an overview of oncytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that defects of the respiratory chain occur in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unexplained.
Oncocyte metaplasia is expected to be pathogenetically different from oncocyte neoplasia.
There are also organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly found in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient with long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes of this patient are also due to a zinc deficiency of the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic dermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 subjects were compared for their sexual behavior.
As test methods, questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used.
The skin patients studied differ significantly from healthy skin patients in terms of an impaired sexual life.
The exchange of tenderness is significantly reduced in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatics feel more impaired than patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with atopic dermatitis have never been discussed by their doctor.
Despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the skin and venereal disease doctor should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
The conventional X-ray image must still be regarded as a basic examination in clinical cases of inflammatory-rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bone-inflammatory destructions, but also allows us to assess their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image can indicate a clinical relapse situation via the collateral phenomena and show the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths directly and indirectly.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed depiction of cortical bone structures - complementary to MR - provides highly specific information on some specific problems, especially on the stem skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for the definitive diagnosis and partly for the planning of surgery.
This applies, among other things, to the sacral joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper HWS.
The treatment of open lower leg fractures II and III degrees with simultaneous soft tissue damage nowadays includes a wide range of surgical options of primary osteosynthesis.
Via the external fixator, the undrilled marrow nail up to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this occurs under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
It was only because of the associated successes that it was possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the previously high rate of invalidating amputations and infections.
Although initially only individual cases were observed, the signs increased that these patients often had soft tissue problems on the lower leg ranging from the recurrent swelling tendency to the cruris ulcer.
A clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and compared to 50 healthy subjects showed that more than 50% of all patients suffered clinically significant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of the injury ranges from a simple swelling tendency to the cruris ulcer, and their clinical relevance increases with increasing time to the event of the accident.
Strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required to prevent further, even iatrogenic, damage, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Aim of surgery Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal malpositions of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of the shape and function of the limbs.
Muzines are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that exhibit a variety of carbohydrate and/or peptide sequences of antigenic determinants.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry has provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent findings also suggest that mucine-associated antigens play an important role in tumour biology, e.g. in metastasis and as predictive markers.
The present thesis provides an overview of gastrointestinal muzinantigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
The establishment of rheumatic centers in Germany has made it possible in recent years to network the outpatient and inpatient areas with the practising general practitioners, internal and orthopedic specialist rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists as well as the acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatological control centers can contribute in the long term to further improve the cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatological patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care for chronic rheumatological patients in terms of comprehensive rheumatological quality management.
Despite the increasing incidence of medicolegal problems, knowledge about the nature and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is low.
An analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from 1975-1998 in the area of the Medical Chambers of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the period under review.
In 36 cases (16%) the review committees identified treatment errors.
95% of the complaints concerned the surgeon, 2% the anaesthesiologist, 3% both disciplines and one ENT doctor.
Of the complaints, 90% were related to complications following routine thyroid surgery.
Surgery-typical complications such as recurrent sparsity (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), post-bleeding (3%) and delayed recurrence (1%) together accounted for 63% of treatment errors but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodes (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of the allegations but 70% of the treatment errors.
Only 11% of the identified treatment errors had clearance deficiencies.
Treatment error detection was particularly common when re-surgery was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by a follow-up error (p < 0.001).
The field of “Environment and Health” is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high demand for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes significant problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform in this field.
Recognized indications are bilateral renal tumours, renal tumours in patients with functional and anatomical solitary kidneys and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis following tumour phrectomy (imperative indications).
Improvements in surgical strategy, such as hypothermic perfusion and work-bench surgery, can also prevent more than 95% of patients with multiple and advanced renal tumours from undergoing nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving renal tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers recommend the extension of parenchyma-sparing renal tumor surgery to selected patients with a contralateral healthy kidney (selective indications).
However, at an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears small.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrences is in most cases poor.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has been most commonly described in small cell lung cancer to date.
We report about 3 patients with CAR in the presence of a breast cancer or a carcinoid of the cervix uterus.
Background and question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterial skin diseases was assessed.
Combining UVB therapy with topical administration of vitamin D analogues is an accepted standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but also has little side-effects.
Below is a report of a patient who experienced pronounced long-term hyperpigmentation in the healed psoriatic herds with this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard treatment of urolithiasis.
Using largely the same technical principles, different lithotriptors have been developed.
The so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence are currently being discussed, which make a corresponding metaphylaxis useful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in addition to other forms of therapy are still pending.
Isolated acute clinical corneal calcification has been observed following treatment of fibrin reaction in the anterior portion of the eye with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).
The previously unknown pathomechanism led us to the following investigations.
The concomitant occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease may have far-reaching and life-threatening consequences.
In our case studies we present the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
different possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, which were first described in 1901 by Karl Landsteiner, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and displayed after restriction digestion on a polyacrylamide gel by silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwest German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 examined subjects (3.57%) a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype was shown with the analysis method chosen here, which takes into account only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703, as it is not possible to differentiate between the A and 02 allele.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic examination.
The fact that exceptions must apply is demonstrated by the following case history.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patella facet after a football match.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, nodule-shaped, transformed hematoma into connective tissue, which could easily be combined with a haul :
During the football match, there was obviously a bleeding due to contusion or patella subluxation.
The boy was discomfort-free after the arthroscopy, the muscular atrophy quickly resolved.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
In the short and medium term, glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation.
Data are presented that suggest a longer-term effect (more than one year).
Recent studies clearly demonstrate a delaying effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammation from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these newer studies provide additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical studies support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are loosely linked by the underlying causes of RA, but develop independently to some extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids may relate to different mechanisms, as discussed elsewhere in this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenic cells express - and -chains of 1-, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and interindividual variation as well as different localizations on the sperm surface.
The nested polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether AM has functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or whether they represent only “biological redundancy” or only the very last binding protection (final insurance).
The labelling of sperm AM was modified by progesterone, human follicle fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of -adrenergic receptors.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an evening increase and nocturnal peak between 2:00 and 4:00.
In addition, melatonin has strong lipophilic properties, independent of the receptor system, the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and to act as a radical scavenger in the extra- and intracellular space.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical administration, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the development of UV erythema.
Some information is available on the penetration properties through the skin and on the oral exposure, which may be supplemented by further studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies, on the one hand, in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals that allow the localization of a source of inflammation when the focus is unclear, because of the possibility of full-body scintigraphy and SPECT technique, on the other hand, in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals that allow the detection of leukocytic infiltration, for example.
Both methods are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which lead to an inflammatory scintigraphy if the result is unclear.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method for the treatment of capillary infant hemangiomas.
Surprisingly, however, there are no detailed studies to prove their effectiveness in tumors that regularly undergo spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial space demand due to post-traumatic bleeding and oedema, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated SHT and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory “system reaction” (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single- or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and dysfunctions are usually survivable, but can be fatal in their combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic states after SHT are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of SHT on the rest of the organism must be contrasted with the effect of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized person on brain function, whereby shock-induced perfusion disorders may cause prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized “whole-body inflammatory response” influences blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the currently applied therapeutic measures, are still insufficient and require further clarification.
Finally, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions which are not directly life-sustaining and which result in an additional burden on the patient due to the trauma of the operation must also be reconsidered.
This paper attempts to summarize important aspects in this field.
The molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human Kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proved to be valuable decision-making aids to better distinguish between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for the early detection of prostate cancer.
Children with facial cleavage have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 completers and evaluated for abnormal personality traits.
They were also asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for discontinuance.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin has been described as an early childhood manifest, dominant hereditary dermatosis with partly circinar reed erythema particularly in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal attachment to the winter half-year and the characteristic histological multiforme findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamic diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient, which fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies of the efficacy of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the papers reviewed reveal clear shortcomings.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether visual acuity decreases with performance time and whether normal subjects and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the driving assessment.
Sudeck syndrome affects an extremity after microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to an injury or surgery of an extremity.
His theory did not find support, since most of the medical profession believes that Sudeck syndrome is caused by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We carried out a number of clinical and experimental studies and also investigated the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, procedures for the application of fast multi-layer spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
In addition to the radiological examination procedures commonly used in dentistry, computed tomography enables a superposition-free imaging of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proved successful in addressing other questions.
If the examination is performed with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the retinated teeth can be assessed so as to enable early treatment.
If the periodontal gap of the retained tooth can be defined, an orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone breakdown should be accurately determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space demands can be measured with CT.
Prior to intended implant treatment, therapy may be optimized by careful consideration of the remaining bone and the location of the nerves and foramina.
If an implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be specified.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of patients with sepsis.
Case studies describe the symptoms of the SE.
The main symptom is a loss of consciousness to the point of coma.
The cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, a generalized brain edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the magnitude of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense responses of the organism to bacterial products as well as the bacteremia itself are important etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte disturbances, hyperthermia, hypoglycaemia, shock and ischaemia, as well as hepatic and renal failure, may contribute to the development of encephalopathy.
Since early and adequate treatment of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE as a possible initial symptom of sepsis is of particular diagnostic importance.
In spite of modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy, endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has an ‰extremely poor prognosis.
Movies tell stories.
Particularly suspenseful are the scenes in which people are confronted with conflicting decisions.
Conflicts about medical ethics do not only appear in medical series or depictions of diseases, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romances, gangster and crime movies.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time act as seismographs for the social relevance of medical-ethical issues.
However, in the film, ethical principles of decision-making may fall prey to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical ethical case review and is a useful complement to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the restenosis rate compared to conventional PTCA has resulted in stent implantation becoming the most common initial intervention.
Therefore, in-stent restenosis - especially the long-lasting form - is a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the rescue service.
In particular, the initial care of the amputee in the event of amputation injuries, in addition to the initial care of the injured person, often determines the success of the rehabilitation measures.
The primary objective of imaging diagnostics of the larynx is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible for laryngoscopic assessment.
Consequently, the general rule is to make the imaging of the larynx in the knowledge of the findings of the endoscopic diagnostic.
The topographical-anatomical conditions of the skeleton, the internal structures and the environment of the larynx will be presented synoptically.
By means of transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system, the instability was eliminated with segmental function preservation.
In recent years, new insights have been gained about post-traumatic changes following skull-brain trauma (SHT) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
In the context of this study, the recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the basic pharmacological intervention possibilities are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in different stages of experimental and clinical trials.
Background and question.
Melanoma patients in stage IV with progressive disease progression represent a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease of melanoma patients who have not been treated with therapy.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had taken Minocycline prophylactically for over 3 years for pulmonary silicosis before symptomless facial black spots appeared.
The other patient developed grey-black patches on both lower legs after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis.
Trial treatment with ruby laser resulted in a reduction of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The different clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed on the basis of case studies.
Operational objective Removal of the deformity of a Digitus quintus superductus et varus.
In recent years, microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
A key factor is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
In this study the sensitive regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve after partial resection and reconstruction with the vascular-stemmed thoracic longus was investigated.
Pressure and pain sensations could already be felt for 3 months, touch and vibration for at least 5 months and thermal stimuli for at least 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly stalked thoracic longus is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in cancer patients.
The use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of deliberate drug overdose in the United States and the United Kingdom, but only a relatively small number of overdoses lead to serious complications.
Severe liver toxicity is to be expected in any patient exceeding the standard dose and the minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg/ kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets for a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, any patient for whom the magnitude or timing of overdose is unknown should receive complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be continued if liver function deteriorates.
In case of onset of severe hepatotoxicity, specialist advice should be sought to ensure optimal treatment or immediate transfer in case of acute hepatic failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has considerably improved the fate of a hitherto incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be achieved by closer cooperation between referral hospitals and specialist liver institutions.
Background and question.
Itching is a difficult to treat side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the paprika plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment.
Capsaicin blocks unmyelinated polymodal C and A nerve fibers when applied topically after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a diagnostic and therapeutic problematic urological picture.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for refractory testalgia.
12 patients were surgically treated by seminal cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnosis:
The cremasteric muscle is severed by bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of the testicular A is removed under microsurgical conditions over a distance of 2-3 cm.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are free of symptoms.
No intra- and post-operative complications have been observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical seminal cord neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indications are precise, so that an exact environmental diagnosis is indispensable to rule out a specific genesis of testalgia.
In neurosurgery, too, there is a trend towards less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, minimize preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves, and thus minimize the risk of neurological and psychological disorders.
Hospital stays and incapacity for work can often be shortened.
The essential “minimally invasive” procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, the brain chambers and the subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is the occlusive hydrocephalus.
But also arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and small intraventricular space demands can be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
Using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
The DW-MRI measures the tissue-specific ADC, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumour tissue with multiple intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e. diffusion barriers), a low ADC is expected, in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is expected.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanotic lung tumor that had completely blocked the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumour was classified as malignant melanoma.
There was no history of previous removal of skin, mucosal or eye abnormalities.
The targeted examinations of the skin and the eye also revealed no evidence of a localized primary tumor.
Thus, the neoplasm is considered to be a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
There is no experience of twilight vision after LASIK.
Therefore, we examined twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has become established as a standard method for non-invasive ischemic diagnosis.
Using ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacological stress protocols as currently used in echocardiography can be performed.
Corneal HLA-DR antigens are lost during organ culture storage.
This study investigated whether it is a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans (LZ) cells.
DNA cytometry has developed into a routine diagnostic technique that is preferably used in breast cancer to assess plloidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry due to its less meaningful power.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodically flawless technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for the determination of S-phases.
The parameters obtained, in the first line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in the second line also the plloidy, represent prognostic and important factors for therapy planning.
Precise knowledge of the method and possible errors is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for the determination of proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information has to be considered unclear at this stage.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric investigations and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
Injection therapy is important for cervical syndromes.
This paper discusses both the general requirements and the various practical procedures for injecting.
Summary The coverage of the costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in HIV by the statutory health insurance is unclear, but the issue of coverage by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical care (§ 23 SGB V) and health examinations (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
PEP is health treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as appropriate recommendations from the Federal Committees are lacking.
It would be desirable to adopt recommendations in the near future in order to remove the legal uncertainty in this area.
In some cases, an obligation to bear costs may be considered in accordance with the principles of the legal status of the so-called new methods of examination and treatment.
However, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP need to be made more specific in terms of indication and method of application and be cleared of ambiguity.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, as there are still too many uncertainties from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present paper investigates the importance of a prolonged corneal storage time for the success of a perforating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experience with 3dimensional echocardiography, we tried to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanel studies 3dimensional and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent adverse event in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report about a 37-year-old patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation, developed heterotopic ossification of 5 large bodily joints with almost complete stiffening.
Intensive therapy was initiated by duplicate lung transplantation in severe pulmonary hypertension.
Resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints allowed restoration of mobility.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatic, after spinal cord injuries, after SHT, during intoxications and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, it is assumed that mesenchymal cells are transformed into osteoblasts and chondroblasts, which then cause new bone formation.
Diagnosis is made with the help of imaging techniques.
For prophylaxis, drug treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both may be performed.
We report about a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) in whom we used the argon laser for the first time for local therapy.
The patient had long-standing skin changes that could not be influenced or only marginally by established treatment strategies.
After the use of the argon laser, a complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of the treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
In the context of these case descriptions, the efficacy of argon laser in the treatment of treatment-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is demonstrated for the first time.
Overall, complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
This is often the only life-saving option for the affected patient.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by human polyclonal antibodies to HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Hepatitis C reinfection occurs regularly in all patients and has a better prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis in hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for transplantation after reinfection is less favorable, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable with other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity on the basis of a case study and the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception are rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in preexcitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative claims.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodrome or antidrome reentrytachycardia of varying incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitation conduction system and the detection of other paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident heart disease should be evaluated prior to the intervention by echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of the procedure with contrast imaging.
In 300 patients with various variants of preexcitation syndrome, individual results of catheter ablation are presented.
Standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary in order to obtain a better quality record of complication events in orthopaedics and to have comparable statistics over years.
The Heidelberg Orthopaedic University Hospital Foundation has been keeping a complete, consented register of all early complications of all inpatients since 1.1.1997.
Complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature and the information is checked, corrected, supplemented and classified by the quality management department of the clinic.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard for the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopaedics with the aim of building consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the occurrence of blisters in the area of the acre in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, impairment of dermoepidermal coherence, which is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of bulging bladders, is likely to be the underlying cause of the treatment.
Acrobullous photodermatosis must be differentiated by differential diagnosis from phototoxic reactions caused by excessive UVA irradiation or excessive psoral concentrations.
The clinical, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this disease are presented on the basis of two cases.
Apart from autoptically confirmed findings of a fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology developed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological characteristics, which have been divided into primary and secondary criteria.
The following study on a group of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, will test the validity of the established criteria.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle according to the main criteria were detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography or echocardiography.
Four patients (16%) had only minor criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of right ventricle segmental kinetic abnormalities.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be detected histologically.
T inversions in right-precordial derivatives as a secondary criterion occurred in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS broadening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis using signaling-mediated ECG was available in only 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of adverse criteria.
Left thigh block ventricular tachycardia, classified as secondary criteria, was detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died with no documented arrhythmias due to progressive right heart failure.
A family history of unexpected sudden cardiac death as a secondary criterion was observed in 3 out of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for diagnosing ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, but the importance of a secure histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without the inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favorable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more possible.
There is clear evidence that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia in cerebral ischemia is controversial.
The conflicting results of the clinical and experimental studies can partly be explained by considering different types of stroke separately and by taking into account the time course of the blood glucose level during the acute event.
Hyperglycaemia appears to magnify neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischaemia if inadequate collateral care is present.
The risk of haemorrhagic transformation is also increased during this period.
In contrast, an acute increase in blood glucose by improving substrate supply may protect nerve tissue from structural damage if there is only a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow.
This situation exists in the area of the Penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
Therefore, we hypothesize that both the positive and the negative effects of acute hyperglycemia depend on the local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy diagnostic surgery according to which 50 out of 173 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsies have undergone resective epilepsy surgery.
The localization of findings from non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), interectal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) formed the basis of the focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients were seizure-free or had very rare seizures.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with drug-resistant focal, especially temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG derivations are sufficient for pre-surgical diagnosis to avoid the risk of invasive EEG examinations.
History and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented in an outpatient hospital with a new onset of tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiography initially revealed the suspicion of an intracardial space demand, which should be further clarified by transesophageal echocardiography.
In the Ekg a tachyarrhythmia absoluta was found with frequencies up to 146/min, intermittently a sinus rhythm was also documented.
This could also be confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large space requirement in projection to the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal edge laterally protruding.
Due to the displacement of the cyst resulting in atrial rhythm disturbances and to safely exclude malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in the sinus rhythm and complains only of isolated “suspensions”, most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primarily harmless atrial rhythm disorders may also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intra-cardial space demands, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cerebral nerve palsies can have a variety of causes.
A rare cause of paresis of one or multiple brain nerves is a dissection of the carotis interna.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even in atypical symptoms, is important, as early anticoagulatory therapy can prevent a stroke as a result of dissection-related embolism.
We report about 2 patients with lesions of the parakavernous brain nerves (Raeder syndrome) and of the caudal brain nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotis.
In addition to the cranial and caudal brain nerves involved in our cases, defects of the middle brain nerves (VI-VIII) have been described, so that any painful sudden brain nerve failure must also be reminiscent of carotid dissection.
The dysfunction of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic into old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis was made by chance in the context of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The surgery consisted of transplantation of the coronary artery malfunction without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases due to coronary stiffness and associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joint offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result due to low, surgically induced soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least an exercise stability, even in comparison with the standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the minor surgical soft tissue trauma, arthroscopy makes the exact intraoperative assessment of joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intraarticular concomitant injuries particularly advantageous compared to conventional procedures.
From a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures, arthroscopically supported osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients in the period from September 1993 to January 1998.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed overall good results based on the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In selected patients, we consider arthroscopically supported minimally invasive osteosynthesis also suitable for fractures with AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report about a 72-year-old patient who developed bilateral hypoglossus paresis without other neurological deficits after moderate cranial brain trauma, which resolved clinically within 3 months.
Since no cranial base fracture in the posterior pit could be detected by computed tomography, we discuss a two-sided distortion of the hypoglossus nucleus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped sufficiently from the veins of the legs under the conditions of everyday life.
The backlog spreads from the large conduction veins through the smallest venoles to the area of microcirculation and ultimately affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical characteristics are best used as a basis for classification principles, which can be confirmed by a simple objective measurement procedure.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the floor of arteriovenous short circuits.
In the area of the lower extremities, unilateral skin changes reminiscent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi’s sarcoma) occur.
These are accompanied by oedema, often severe pain and rarely hypertrophy of the limb concerned.
The disease is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerating nodes with a tendency to bleed and infect.
Causal therapy consists of elimination of arteriovenous shunts.
Due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas, a surgical procedure is rarely feasible.
Superselective embolization is more appropriate, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
Successful embolization treatment in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome has been reported.
Until now, the precise diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin has been based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology at the freezer section (CD1a), in addition to the clinical and histology at the H&E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffing-carrying markers now allow a (also retrospective) analysis and precise classification of these diseases, even on formal-fixed material.
Antibodies against S-100 protein and the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) allow the classical cells of Langerhanscell histiocytosis (LZH) to be distinguished from other histiocytic cell systems.
In the so-called non-Langerhanscell histiocytoses (non-LZH), there were no uniform electron optical and immunohistological characteristics.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are important for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their responses to the corresponding paraffingent immunohistological markers may vary considerably within the different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown in the example of xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in juvenile xanthogranuloma) appear to be diagnostic for the delimitation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with epitheloid cells typical of the disease.
In the following we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of administration of allopurinol and after re-exposure of this drug.
Verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner ulcer for 10 years.
Seven case reports of the non-bilharzia-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of verucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verucous carcinoma appears to be the chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhaustion of conservative therapeutic options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urine discharge were performed.
NoToX Histological Fixative is offered as a substitute for formalin for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examination.
Intraoperative tissue and autoptic organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistological staining, especially for tumor diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these investigations, which were carried out independently in 3 different establishments, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX did not differ in any way from those fixed with formal tissue samples in terms of reproducibility of conventional stains or visualization of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven to be a useful substitute for formalin.
Dose parameters such as the Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI), the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and the axis dose are commonly used to describe the patient’s exposure to radiation in computed tomography.
The CTDI and derived from it the MSAD are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but they say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axial dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose, which allows an estimation of the risk.
The provision of an upper axis dose guide should take into account the dose requirements of the study region in order to ensure acceptable image quality and to avoid unnecessary risk.
As physical variables, all 3 variables are useful for characterizing and differentiating different examination programs and instruments with regard to radiation exposure.
According to a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been added to this definition.
Consequently, a number of infectious pathogens, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and ventricular dilation.
It seems sensible to assign shame, as a general human emotion, a place in its own right, to distinguish it from guilt.
In addition to the defense character, the “self-preserving” function of shame should also be considered.
The occurrence of shame always indicates protection of the sense of value, even if it should not be evident in the patient at the moment.
The signaling character of shame is discussed and the question whether shame symptoms have a disease value is considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics expands the view to potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides an overview of the literature on the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very inhomogeneous in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as in terms of professional competence.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder- and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the past 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Atherosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show an increase in inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined by immunohistochemistry (TUNEL fragmented DNA assay) and electron microscopy.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events and to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.
In an in vivo study and on specially fixed corpses - according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - the positional relationship of the transversal fascia to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated was investigated.
In TEP, the fascia can only be used laterally to reinforce the back wall of the groin canal or as an abutment to fix foreign material (network).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin changes.
The detection of numerous mites in the scalp crusts led to the diagnosis of scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be excluded in both cases.
It is assumed that the treatment of eczema in the sense of immunosuppression, which lasted for months, led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions in O2 transport and in particular the effective delivery of O2 to tissues has been demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme haemodilution and haemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically viable intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
The remaining adverse reaction of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today is some vasoconstriction.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important member of the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured patients.
It is expected to be introduced in the coming years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, HBO therapy has a number of generally accepted indications for which it is either the only causal, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive, therapeutic component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lung, special attention should be paid to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication, and the ability and ability to safely control emerging complications with intensive care or emergency medical interventions.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthetist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this paper, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for acoustically accessible tumors due to its good depth-focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for “online” monitoring of ultrasound-induced high temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive MRI temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
In a group of extremely small premature infants, the long-term effects of preterm birth on ophthalmologic and ENT status should be demonstrated.
At the Orthopaedic University Hospital Homburg/Saar, a computerized system has been used since 1993 to document surgery and outpatient procedures as well as to support the general organization of the hospital.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS- or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnostics and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its launch, the system has recorded data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 operations.
If the software is flexible, the requirements of both the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through a further, clinic-wide networking, the University Hospital Homburg also offers the opportunity for interdepartmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks and the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey at German epilepsy centers about the usual pre- and post-operative medication treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The objective of the study was to determine whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupil response.
Non-medical reasons for the (mostly innocent) victims’ dissatisfaction with the current compensation practice are also mentioned.
In this study on sheep it should be clarified whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans correlates with the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether a temporal correlation can be established and whether the results suggest the use of GAG as prognostic criterion or osteoarthritis marker.
21 sheep are randomized into 3 groups of 7 animals:
The controls are the knee joints of the contralateral side and the knee joints of animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological scores between the TD vs. ME and MV groups differed statistically significantly (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, HA was significantly increased in the ME and MV groups.
In the case of CS, both 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial separation, a significantly increased level (p < 0.01).
Clinical consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - to some extent a description of the degree of osteoarthritis.
The concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic Long QT Syndrome may present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures.
Treatment with blockers is considered standard of care for symptomatic patients.
In case of treatment failure, a pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockade may be considered as an option.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
Supplements and use of an epidiascope, which after minor modifications is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ discs in the courses of general and special pathology and avoids complex video installations with additional lighting etc. are described.
Narcissistic problems are common in later life and of far-reaching importance.
These problems are here related to the instance of the ego-ideal and examined in the light of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego-ideal in old age.
In three aspects, pathological exacerbations of the aging process, which often occur in older patients, are shown.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are described and options and objectives in the treatment of older patients are discussed.
The treatment results of Muscle energy technique after Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with muscle energy technique.
The therapy is highly successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to impulse chirotherapeutic techniques.
We report about a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhoea and Sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy reveal the diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different diseases has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement of clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the real disorder in the structure of the individual immunological symptoms.
In industrialized countries, it is medical conditions rather than lack of food that contribute to malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly prevalent among older people, occurring in 5-12% of those living independently, 30-61% of those hospitalized and 40-85% of those living in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial character of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
Increased medical awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important for the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
A light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
Digiform radiary outcrops, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like border zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
However, specific light microscopic phenomena are still unknown.
Therefore, a diagnostic assessment of melanocytic tumor malignancy is based on several single, combined, suspected malignancy features.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy techniques in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Commonly related vector transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical trials in which such a gene has been transferred (IRAP) are an important step forward in the clinical gene therapy of osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for the correction of hypoplastic mandible.
We report on our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral application in 4 selected patients with hypoplasia in the context of syndromes.
These included 1 boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral lower jaw hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with rodent syndrome and 1 rare case of midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The distraction duration ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm.
Older people interested in continuing education are increasingly aware of the many opportunities offered by the Internet in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and institutions for the education of older people are called upon to provide them with better access to the world of digital media, support them in acquiring media literacy and create attractive virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on the experience of the information campaign “Senior-Info-Mobile”, it describes ways to give people over 50 access to new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European Learning in Later Life (LiLL) network and other projects, it further demonstrates how the spatially and temporally decoupled ’research learning’ of older adults, in the form of virtual workgroups and networks, could become the engine of a ’new learning culture’, including those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or training institution or who are unable to take part in local courses for health or other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by noninvasive MR angiography.
The rapid technological development of MR tomography in recent years has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods.
Cardiac MR tomography is characterized by the combination of simultaneous recording of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, Cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
The MR tomography is the only diagnostic method that offers the complete clarification of heart disease in a single examination, both as an initial examination and as a follow-up.
Due to the rapid progress of development, remaining limitations, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be overcome in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and IT at the Orthopedic University Hospital of Heidelberg is given.
Since its creation in 1967, four phases of development can be distinguished:
initial medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, implementation of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of performance.
Planning and implementation were carried out in accordance with the framework plans and concepts of the university hospitals of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
We report the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of an extracorporeal cardiac pressure massage.
This is the first published case.
We report a bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyema and development of an infected spurial aneurysm.
Contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus must be presumed to be the cause.
Treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with one-sided split foot type II with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current state of the controversy surrounding the indication for the back surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described as well as design features of the different implant types and peculiarities of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar back surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for the replacement of the back surface is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patellar back surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overloading of the boundary layers due to changes in stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be excluded.
Arterial hypertension is commonly observed following organ transplantation in adults following treatment with the hypertensive medicinal products cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
Little research has been done on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term “occult fracture” denotes the absence of visible signs of fracture in the conventional radiography performed for initial diagnosis when a fracture is still present.
The diagnosis can only be made during the course or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations performed for this purpose have only a moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that allows the early diagnosis of the “occult fracture” as well as the diagnosis of possible concomitant chondral and ligamentary injuries.
In the present study, we reported about 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, in which the diagnosis could be made with MRI after negative X-ray results.
Athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon described early on.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Due to the highly variable clinical picture and the need for invasive or post mortem diagnosis, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical procedures or catheterizations of the aorta.
Anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with stilted and movable thrombes originating from circumscribed plaques.
Embolic recurrence was prevented and regression of the thrombi was observed.
A 62-year-old patient with pronounced valgus malposition and elongation inhibition of the right knee joint as a consequence of a supracondylar femur fracture was treated osteosynthetically with a dynamic condylene screw 2 years ago.
Here the indication was made for a varying and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis using retrograde femur nail.
Within the 1st postoperative week, the patient was able to fully load the right lower extremity with axial adjustment.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method for achieving good and load-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective surgeries.
Tear-way operations at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from 1987 - 1992 were examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspect, but do not themselves prove a carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nucleus size, hyperchromasia, nucleoles, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratines must in any case be critically evaluated and may at best confirm or exclude a cancer diagnosis (in case of positive basal cell detection).
In this review the different diagnostic criteria are compiled and their relevance for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 14 days 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. was compared to a monthly dose of 50mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study received an initial dose of 100 mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed rapid and marked improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, despite continued administration of the test substance, an increase in inflammation parameters occurred.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
It is reported that a 13-month-old patient developed Kasabakh-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal haemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
Even the healthy newborn is entitled to optimal care, so that any disorders of postnatal adaptation can be detected in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of increased resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used for many years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging is performed in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aquajogging is used as regeneration training and as a “low-impact alternative training” in endurance and endurance.
In rehabilitation, aquajogging is ideally suited for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and post-operative phase for musculoskeletal disorders as well as for endurance and light strength training for internal disorders.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular or prosthetic in nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery is the only causal therapy for a selected patient population.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classical risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
In contrast to initial short-term results, the long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to about 53-55%.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic decline in long-term success (less than 40% on average).
Penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90 % long-term survival rates of the implants and a patient satisfaction rate of 89 %.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapy option to be the last in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the device type, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations may occur with 5-year implant survival rates of 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by a perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limb grafts, which are, however, highly immunogenic.
We report on our 3 years of experience with the homologous central limbokeratoplasty method developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is relatively commonly used for bladder instillation and significantly reduces the nocturia frequency, while daytime micturia frequency was unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also decreased the frequency of nocturia in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are practically free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, and this is also true for applications in radiology.
Thousands of web sites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, competing with commercial offerings.
According to the first experiences, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a medium for the distribution of radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal responses of parents after Sudden Infant Death (SID).
In the following we report from a psychiatric and forensic point of view about 2 cases in which the mothers reacted to SID with exceptionally severe depression and accused themselves of having killed their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of concerned parents are given.
A review of 110 children admitted with Burkitt lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, over a period of 7 years showed that male patients were overweight (1,9 :
1) and a peak age of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is suggested that an interrelationship between malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumor.
The most important drug is cyclophosphamide.
Combining this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in initiating the recovery of the disease, but is better than the individual drug at preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up studies of patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has been a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun’s life’s work.
Zwickau Surgery provided important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and the organization of hospitals, as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures.
After a short literature review, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the backdrop of former fears of abandonment, the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggression lead to a renewed threat of abandonment.
The symptom, which until now served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and anxieties, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamic skin disease with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%.
The skin changes, which are often difficult to treat, sometimes respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, may cause pustular dermatitis as an undesirable effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report on the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after the administration of a dithranol preparation which is 50 times too concentrated in the magistral formulation in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascul‰ren hypertension is of particular importance because it is a secondary form of hypertension that can be successfully treated and partly curated in many F‰llen by interventional radiological or gef‰flurgical measures.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications following LASIK should be evaluated.
One andrologic patient has been reported for whom the initial examination resulted in the detection of high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicular size substantially below the normal range indicated a pronounced testicular parenchyma damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate swab may be considered as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After combination antibiotic therapy with doxycycline and 3 months of recovery under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E as well as the trace element zinc, a marked improvement in spermiogram results.
After another 2 months, intrauterine insemination resulted in a pregnancy followed by the birth of a healthy daughter.
At that time, the patient had only mild teratozoospermia.
As part of quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different established standard anaesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy should be described during systemic corticosteroid therapy.
The X-ray image of the pelvic overview is still an indication for diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy, in addition to sonography.
The toddler’s legs should be kept in a central position.
Side rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
A look back at 150 years, including 50 years of personal experience of the development of septorhinoplasty, which last took a backward development in the 19th century in the “open approach” with the opening of the nose tip.
This technique should not be used again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
Sublabial access to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the diagnostic imaging of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the thoracic X-ray is of primary importance.
A thorough understanding of the normal thoracic image and the possible physiological peripartal changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of neonatal thoracic imaging.
Paediatric pathologies:
A large number of congenital and acquired abnormalities encountered by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnostics of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or may affect the quality of life later in life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here, an overview of the most important pathologies that the radiologist may encounter in his daily routine is given.
The primary tumours were breast carcinoma (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric carcinoma (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinoma (n = 6 each) and 14 other tumours.
Extrahepatic tumours (including primary synchronous tumours) occurred in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, and of the 120 primary resections, 51% (n = 61) were extrahepatic tumours.
Of the 120 first resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
Median overall survival after first resection was 20 months, 28 months after R0 resection, and 8 months after R1/2 resection.
After second resection (n = 14), the median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumours at the time of first hepatic resection, the median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and after R1/2 resection was 7 months.
The available results show that the resection of noncolorectal nonneuroendocrine liver metastases also promises a prognostic benefit.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic relapses may even benefit from second or third resections of the liver.
In some cases, impressive long-term trends could be observed even when the initial situation was rather unfavorable.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
A 32-year-old man is accused of attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed as to the unidentified act, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in prison, he suffered a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the A. communicans anterior.
For the purposes of assessing guilt, this course of events, in the context of the attested behavioral abnormalities shortly before the offence, therefore makes it possible to take into account the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the offence.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also been proven for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated in the vitreous body.
Due to the high specific weight of PFCL, the IOL is swollen and can be repositioned in the anterior part of the eye, where it can be refixed e.g. in the ciliary sulcus.
It is not clear what kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL.
Since PFCL is likely to be biotoxic with prolonged intraocular exposure, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
Rare cases of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma have been reported.
Metastasis occurred after a seven-year postoperative interval.
Further investigations did not reveal any clinically measurable metastases.
Taking into account the cases described so far, however, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas annulare) of the two attachments.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas annulare can ultimately only be secured by a visualization of the pancreatic duct.
Congenital diseases include genetic defects, in which other organ systems are usually affected and in which the extrapancreatic damage is usually in the foreground of the disease.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes of the organ, which can be detected with modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain more than just the material written by the author.
On the basis of the panels of Bärensprung and Hebra, it is explained that at second glance they also reveal some other medical-historically relevant facts.
Approximately 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragm hernia/ defect are asymptomatic at birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presented congenital diaphragm defects, namely the association with primary funnel breast and a fatal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The ability of ultrasound to detect bacterial coxitis was evaluated.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), fugax coxitis (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes’ disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined sonographically.
The ultrasound image can be used to assess the joint capsule, the hip head surface and the periarticular structures in the standard DEGUM incision levels.
An intraarticular spatial demand (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as articular capsular distension.
This capsule detachment has been detected by sonography in bacterial coxitis, fugax coxitis, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and early perthes disease.
Since the joint capsular distension does not differ significantly between the diseases, the sonogram does not allow differentiation of these diseases in the presence of capsular distension without bone changes.
Consequently, bacterial coxitis cannot be reliably distinguished sonographically from coxitides of other origins;
Capsular distension is considered to be a non-specific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, immediate diagnostic puncture may be required under sonographic supervision.
Due to additional bone changes in addition to capsular distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be distinguished sonographically from bacterial coxitis as well as from coxitides of other origins.
The diagnosis of the rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made on the basis of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since both cases had unusually high levels of decifferentiated tumour cells for gliomatosis cerebri, atypical findings such as contrast imaging in MRI and clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure complicated diagnosis.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly described.
Different trial designs such as cohort study, case-control study, and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are noted.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and presented as the only way in which causal relationships can be established in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements of clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical procedures, but that good clinical research depends first and foremost on careful study design.
The possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has so far been assessed in different ways.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost ignored in examinations.
This retrospective study was conducted to investigate a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclic.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with atherosclerotic symptomatic infarenal aortic stenosis were treated with transluminal angioplasty and primary palmaz stent implantation.
Simultaneously, in one case a thrombotic arterectomy of the A. iliaca externa with deep aplasty was performed, in another case angioplasty with stent implantation of the A. iliaca communis was performed.
Technical and clinical success was evident in all cases.
No occlusion or clinical restenosis occurred during a median follow-up period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation in segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a somewhat invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary There is a report of a patient who underwent sterility treatment for several years and became pregnant despite not wanting to have a child.
The different species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous as pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has historically been classified as rather apathogenic to humans.
We describe the case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in the tracheal secretion after an aortocoronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit.
The serological tests performed, indirect haemagglutination test with antigen and (Author:
is “monoclonal antibodies” correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibody-covered latex particles were multiple negative.
A postmortem Aspergillus test with a newer method, antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiographic findings.
The patient died before the use of antifungal therapy, the post-mortem showed a disseminated fungal infection of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay may facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
Due to the correct assessment of the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even in the case of a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
Epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in developed countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high perforation rate in young children and the elderly demonstrate the low diagnostic safety.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a definite conclusion on the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
After refractive surgery on the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular imaging errors ( aberrations) may occur which cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal-induced visual acuity is often not reached despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image errors under clinical conditions would be an important first step in documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive techniques.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been carried out experimentally.
Ecke and Hofmann came to the conclusion that a comparable stability was to be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that ankylosis was to be preferred because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis for prophylaxis.
By simultaneous-multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire straps and PDS bandings were compared.
Symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire strapping nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, although these procedures allowed symphysis mobility beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, instability was increased by incision of the Cerclagen and Bandings in the bones or breaking of the Wire Cerclagen to the point of complete failure.
In the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, however, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the bolt anchor.
With primary over-tilting of the screws, plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic loading.
With primarily stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55 500 load changes with a load corresponding to half the average body weight.
For clinical use, it can be deduced from these results that neither the bridging tension strap with wire circllagen nor the PDS banding stabilize the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for an early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If the DC plate or the reconstruction plate can be used primarily to stabilize the ruptured symphysis by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with “open-book injury” can be mobilized with partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs) have been implanted for years with good success.
Due to the light distribution over several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
Additional reduction in light or stray light effects due to capsule fibrosis may lead to early visual impairment.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm, moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumor was initially misidentified as a primary anaplastic thyroid cancer.
Only 17 months later, a 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected by duodenopancreatectomy.
The re-evaluation of primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of thyroid tumour as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later from an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local administration of pharmaceuticals.
The only currently approved oral substance with proven efficacy is yohimbine, a centrally active alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with central targets are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine significantly better than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, has also shown encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous administration are available for local administration.
As a substance used, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has at present largely displaced other pharmaceuticals.
Currently, several promising substances with different approaches and different dosage forms are in development as therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient’s state of consciousness and contribute to a therapeutic multimedia flow that is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are in their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemo, radiation and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies, summarized under the term immunotherapy.
Achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40 % of patients experience a temporary stabilisation of the disease, in some cases lasting years.
These are predominantly results from uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy patients over non- or chemotherapy patients.
A survival advantage is assured for patients with objective remissions.
It is currently not possible to define a standard of care.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of current treatment protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in remission rates and the survival advantage reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
It should normally be administered in the context of clinical studies.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, 262 males (about half of whom were 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years of age) and 239 females (about half of whom were 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years of age), laboratory indices were calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and correlations with biological age were verified according to Ries.
The calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters correlate significantly with ageing.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm large cystadenofibrome of the epiploic appendix of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered by chance during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old patient.
It had the same histology as analogous ovarian tumors and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the epiploic appendices and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypes in the peritoneal rinsing fluid.
These findings may be related to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and localization of primary peritoneal neoplasia of the Müller type are discussed.
In addition to an optimized positioning of the patellar tendon graft, it was hoped that this procedure would provide benefits in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique could not be proven so far.
15 endoscopic and 14 open-operated patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
Lysholm and Tegner score systems, ligament stability (KT-1000), surgery duration and proprioception were measured using the angle reproduction test.
The energy dose of spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 head positions using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube performance recommended by the manufacturer of the CT scanner for a dental CT was gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose from computed tomography ranged from 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the radiation channel) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw specimens were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approximately 76% had no effect on the measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of an enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilatative cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of dilatative cardiomyopathy, allows a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy (no detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response, which can be detected by histological and especially immunohistological techniques.
A subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral RNA detection in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy was performed using a combination of histological, immunohistological and molecular techniques.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/post-operative), bacterial endogenous (haematogenic) osteomyelitis can be distinguished from the less common group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which in contrast to the others manifests preferably on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case studies.
For differential diagnosis the primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be taken into account despite its rare occurrence, since it is - according to bioptic diagnostic confirmation - a domain of conservative, medicinal therapy.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Based on a literature review, the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols is examined using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses and, above all, well-designed clinical trials can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman’s disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease in the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative agent, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
This paper presents the in-vitro and in-vivo results of our research on paclitaxel.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was preferred for in-vivo application.
Staining of the cytoskeleton as well as electron optics were used to demonstrate the paclitaxel effect in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
In rabbits, locally administered paclitaxel significantly inhibited neointimal proliferation and vessel diameter widening compared to balloon-dilated controls.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contraction force was demonstrated after paclitaxel administration.
In addition to age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplamsa and basal membranes of the RPE cells (“basal laminar deposits”), different manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularizations and pigment epithelial detachments show a splitting of the Bruchian membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus can be detected.
Recent studies show that spinal arch dysplasia and spondylolysis occur as a consequence of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease as a function of the lesion site and the type of visual ailment in order to enable early surgical treatment with maintenance of hand function by means of improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of the frequent dermatoses, there is a lack of suitable, naturally occurring animal models.
Transgenic technology, established in the 1980s, fills this gap.
At first it was an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented, specifically dermatological basic research.
It made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses using the murine model and gain insights into their pathogenesis.
By targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to investigate the wound healing process.
Transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The presence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues such as posterior cranial cavity processes, spinal abscesses and discomfort in the interior of the knee are better examined with MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect the wearer of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and displacement of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in patients with artificial heart valves appears insufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of the MRI of their respective valve prostheses.
Some companies based their statements on unseen examinations, or shifted the responsibility to the doctor performing the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Based on our survey, we provide an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and requirements for MRI safety standards in patients with artificial heart valves.
In an experimental study, intravenous CO2 or argon embolism was performed with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas in 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml bolus administration respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), none of the animals died or resuscitation was required.
Poorly soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations where there is an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report about a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma anulare with known diabetic metabolic condition.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which caused us to refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole body baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments resulted in a complete reversal of the lesions on the stem and neck and a marked improvement in the skin condition on the extremities.
No side effects occurred.
Balneophotochemotherapy not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes can be therapeutically influenced.
Cat scratch disease (KKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was isolated.
In the majority of cases there is a typical disease with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and a benign lymphadenopathy.
Less often, further organ manifestations occur.
We report about a 47-year-old patient who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbargia after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were temporary and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint involvement have been reported in the context of a KKK.
However, as the incidence of Bartonella henselae in cats is high in Europe, it may be a more common cause of joint ailments than previously thought.
The diagnosis of KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Through continuous therapy optimization in recent years, the prognosis of Hodgkin’s disease has been significantly improved.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a variety of possible long-term complications that the attending physician needs to be aware of.
Due to often long-lasting symptoms of fatigue, cardiopulmonary problems, under-thyroid function and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the quality of life of most young patients is permanently impaired.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia after primary successful therapy is a significant problem.
Starting from attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the aim was to operationalize these patterns in accordance with their original definition, i.e. as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three bonding styles “safe”, “avoidant” and “ambivalent” have been translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
On the basis of factor analysis results, three scales were constructed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the CFCS at the beginning of psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as binding styles:
“safe”, two variants of “uncertain-ambivalent” (“closed” and “clinging”) and two variants of “uncertain-avoidant” (“closed” and “cooperative”).
Discriminant analysis of these clusters yielded discriminant functions similar to those of Collins & Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of progressive inner ear hearing loss, dizziness and the simultaneous radiological evidence of a contrast absorbing space demand of the inner ear canal substantiate the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report about a 57-year-old patient with anamnestically known Sharp Syndrome and the typical constellation of findings.
The presented case study shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellar bridge, which manifested itself with a peripheral brain nerve failure in the area of ENT and initially lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of only peripheral brain nerves preoperatively suggested the presence of lymphoma.
The occurrence of facial palsy within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia with radiation into the ear are rather unusual for acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings such as in the case described by us must, in spite of present leading symptoms, challenge to obtain a differential diagnostic clarification.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellar bridge angle is considered a rarity.
Balneotherapy and physiotherapy are also available to the gynaecologist in practice, clinic and rehabilitation as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynaecology, balneogynaecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a naturopathic procedure.
Balneogynaecological and physiotherapeutic measures should be used predominantly as supplementary measures according to the indication.
Only in chronic conditions as well as acute muscular tension, they are particularly suited for pain reduction and positive tissue influence as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnosis currently requires an average of four weeks to obtain a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent susceptibility testing.
It takes seven to eight weeks for a negative cultural result to be reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps by new methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The worldwide alarming epidemiological situation regarding the risk of infection of tuberculosis makes it clear that there is a need to develop methods which will enable the detection and differentiation of mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity and their susceptibility to antibiotics in the shortest possible time.
In a prospectively randomized study, a non-joint-bridging assembly of the small fixator external to the AO for the treatment of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated women’s milk has a long tradition in Germany.
Modern screening methods exclude the transmission of infections.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, for very premature babies, milk from donors who have children born prematurely is preferred.
Over the past 20 years, a large number of day care centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centers (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care facilities.
The wide dissemination of these institutions contrasts with the lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and the way they operate.
In this paper, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptoms and the viewpoint of the visitors were collected.
Almost all visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
Current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with moderate severity.
Two-thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, visitors mentioned the contact with other people and the structuring of the day.
The most commonly mentioned negative aspect was interference from other visitors.
Visitors to TSn were younger on average and had higher scores on the BPRS sub-scale of anergy.
Moreover, visitors to the two institutions differed little in the characteristics studied.
The results suggest that both institutions are indeed providing care for chronically mentally ill patients with poor social integration, for whom they are designed.
For these patients, they partly compensate for deficiencies in the social network.
Limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods has made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-assisted imaging sequences can be used to capture information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and permeability of the blood-brain barrier using special models, some from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be represented with diffusion-weighted MRI, the temporally resolved markrovasculature can be represented with MR-angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic examinations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissues can be detected in a multidimensional way and metabolic processes can be observed.
Advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional presentation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The already clinically applicable functional methods are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy discovery, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial investigations have shown that the methods are able to sensitively capture pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared objective of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to ensure the highest possible level of health protection in the countries of the European Region, also in the face of constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors that are harmful to health are to be combated internationally by means of concrete measures or better preventive measures.
An indispensable prerequisite is agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health as well as mutually agreed risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It is important to ensure that governments and their populations develop a common understanding of the important environmental health issues.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a “WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health” (WHO-Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health) at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997.
A 30-year-old patient has been reported to have experienced a right-sided fugax amaurosis with concomitant frontobasal fracture following a fall event.
By means of CT- and MR-angiography a closure of the A. ophthalmica due to a dissection of the A. carotis interne with ascending thrombosis could be established as the cause.
There were no further neurological deficits, as adequate blood flow to the cerebral arteries via the cerebri circulus arteriosus was ensured.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amauroses, such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
Suspected acute aortic dissection requires immediate investigation with appropriate imaging techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In this case, an asymptomatic patient was reported to have echocardiographically suspected aortic dissection.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other sectional imaging procedures to diagnose the evidence of domestication of the aneurysmically enlarged thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was hospitalized for acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea and right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In the further investigation by means of echocardiography, a ruptured sinus-Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary sail with left-right shunt into the right atrium was detected as a non-invasive cause.
The cardiac surgery proceeded without complications while preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right heart sections were normally wide, no shunt was detectable in the color Doppler.
Acute cardiac failure can also be the result of congenital heart defects in middle age.
Echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography allowed a precise diagnosis by non-invasive means.
Rodent syndrome is characterized by mandibulofacial and limb abnormalities.
Hypoplasia of the lower jaw can lead to airway obstruction, particularly in infancy, due to the tongue at the back of the throat.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues were stretched by an extension treatment, mandible distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic results are good.
Respiratory obstruction and dyspnoea were not observed after termination of therapy.
Successful thrombotic arterectomies (TEA) of the carotis interna lead to improved perfusion in the current region of this artery.
However, it is difficult to assess cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors on the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
Practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice is largely defined, but it is still unclear whether this independent medical service is adequately remunerated.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
Nowadays there is no doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is debatable.
In the following we present a 38-year-old patient who suffered from progressive effluvium in psoriasis at the capillitium for years.
Histologically impressive were strand-shaped fibrosations instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which spilled over to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles and signs of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important insofar as consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus probably the development of scarring.
Reduced growth hormone (GH) production is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves several clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion may be due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in -adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin resulting in reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficacy of classic neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled studies, risperidone, the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist, also effectively reduced SVV in the longer term.
The aim of the present study was to create an osteoporosis model by ovarectomy.
Before and after ovarectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw using DXA were performed.
A marked decrease in bone density after ovarectomy was observed in both the upper and lower jaws.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic haemarthrosis of the knee joint were evaluated arthroscopically and treated.
The causes of the hemorrhage were manifold:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence for bleeding from arroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
The surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy produced good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by vipers (Vipera berus).
The viper injects a poison consisting of various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Cross otter bites in children may not be symptomatic, but may also cause the most severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their environment can be displayed on a large scale.
This significantly improves the transmission of the sonographic result to the therapist not present at the examination and the monitoring of a result, e.g. a tumor, during therapy.
Viruses have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity around the world.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies means that more and more messages about epidemics and diseases are being received from all over the world in an ever shorter time.
Using four case studies, this paper examines the factors that may influence the early or late stage of initial diagnosis of dementia.
We have provided the indication for surgery in all our cases.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily taken over and thoroughly rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the seam was additionally secured by fibrin bonding or with an omentum plastic.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
On the basis of these own results and an evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions appear to be justified:
If perforation is secured in the early stages, definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Seam closure of the perforation site should also be attempted in case of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resective procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high surgical risk.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently in children with horseshoe kidney.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed-tissue tumors that rarely have larger adipose tissue proportions.
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which could have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous fraction with internal calcification according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different sectional imaging procedures are presented.
Both differential-diagnostic considerations found their correlation in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high mortality rate of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included at an early stage in the differential diagnostic considerations.
It is reported that a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history of blood-pushing sputum and significant body weight loss was referred to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
The diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis was only possible via a diagnostic detour.
This was triggered by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of the complaint were rapidly reversed and ultimately led to the patient’s recovery.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of diagnostics in the differential diagnosis of thoracic space requirements, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors as well as germ cell tumors.
In hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber’s disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic consequences such as hypercirculatory heart failure often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient in whom percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, adjustable hepatic artery banding was tested as a new treatment concept.
After mini-parotomy, an expander prosthesis was fitted around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
As a result, liver perfusion and cardiac volume were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The technique described thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis in biopsies of benign diseases has been made in 3% in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis occurs in approximately 1% of the total number of births today, the different forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore, both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently to be diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a broad range of causes.
Only a small fraction expresses pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), B lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis occurring in endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases where there is no evidence of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and where pathogen-related mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be carried out on the fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in patients who are weakened or treated with antibiotics.
We report about 2 5 or 14 year old boys with Clostridium-difficile-related colitis without the aforementioned preconditions or a specific underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, extends the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of such a protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Daily screening of respiratory function as well as attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the status and ability of spontaneous respiration are documented, the extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged as there is sufficient evidence that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous respiration attempt.
Gradual withdrawal of mechanical ventilation may be undertaken in patients who have failed spontaneous respiration attempts.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to stop mechanical ventilation influences the rate and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip, jaw and palate is expected to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare baseline and surgical results in 30 patients with one-sided LKG clefts.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal scanning photos and the lateral x-ray image.
Deviations of the nasal symmetry, the nasal width and the nasal wingline from the ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between upper lip and Frankfurt horizontal, and the angle between Columella and Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate the air transmittance.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined and the flow of the slit and non-slit side was compared.
Examinations were performed immediately before and 6 months after surgery.
In the frontal plane there is a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nasal wing inclination.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofacial angle and the deep nasal wing was not achieved.
Through the intervention, the total flow could be increased and the quotient of the flows of the slit and non-slit sides could be corrected.
The aesthetically and functionally relevant findings can be objectified by the applied examination methods and thus serve as a quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents following manual spinal therapy from 1989-1996 were examined.
Properly conducted prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with manipulative treatment of the spine are not available in the literature.
Due to its excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle disorders.
Conventional MRI can reliably show normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stage of the injury, however, the joint fluid necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments is often lacking.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, as intraarticular KM administration distends the joint space with improved distinguishability of intraarticular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also useful in assessing the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions, a KM-flushing of the dissectate can be shown more easily.
Finally, due to high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intraarticular free articular bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
Although invasive, MR arthrography provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle disorders.
The therapeutic objective of resuscitation must be the social reintegration of the person after acute treatment, ideally the state before the onset of the emergency.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients resuscitated due to cardiac arrest in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of V. saphena-magna and/or parva-type varicosis.
Ascension may lead to a migration of the thrombus into the deep vein system via the mouths of the stem veins in the groin and knee throat or via insufficient vv. perforantes, which threatens the complication of a pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the stem veins without involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and/or parva and the deep vein system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfasially via insufficient vv. perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicosis is surgically remedied only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation involves the crossectomy, the removal of the stem vein via separate incisions, the exhairesis of all varicose branches and the ligation of insufficient perforant v.
In type III, thrombectomy via the saphena-magna and/ or parva mouth has priority over all other procedures.
Pachydermodactylia is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral parts of the fingers and occurs almost only in young men.
Formal pathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a review of the literature, exogenous factors in the form of compulsive actions seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) is often associated with central nervous system involvement.
Typical symptoms are irritability, restlessness, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological failure.
We report a 52 year old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute organo-brain psychosyndrome with progressive impairment of consciousness to coma.
Initial cranial computed tomography showed a discrete, general brain swelling, which resolved independently of the clinical deterioration.
The cranial magnetic resonance imaging was inconspicuous.
In transcranial Doppler sonography there were generalized increases in flow velocity (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides as well as A. basilaris).
The causal relationship between river velocity increases and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the reversal of river velocity increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
Continuous follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although the gold standard for the treatment of cruciate ligament injuries is replacement plastic, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent option for adolescents.
We report on the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic truncus.
This was preceded by a blunt chest trauma in a traffic accident.
Computed tomography (CT) was not able to diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be requested if possible to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia issued by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
Recently published official recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific evidence and are categorized in terms of their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are considerably more detailed than the official German guidelines and, in some cases, differ considerably from them.
The purpose of this brief description of the American guidelines is to provide clinicians with a sound decision-making aid for their own practical work on many everyday, but by no means minor, problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma received prolonged treatment with iloprost for 21 days.
The dose was 2 ng/kgbwxmin over a 6 day slide-in period.
Treatment resulted in improvements in inflammatory parameters, lung function, especially diffusion capacity and acral dysfunctions.
The elbow joint, due to its central location, is considered the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view.
Bone and ligament injuries in the proximal forearm confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and limited movement, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today there is little doubt that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with precise reconstruction of the joint surface is as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early initiation of physiotherapeutic exercises.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in this paper taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Tampering by the patient with subcutaneous portions of electrode that are palpable through the skin may result in damage to the tube.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrodes and transmuscular subclavic puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already used successfully in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
The present overview describes the mechanism of action and the pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes the current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility to analyze structures in single steps with tomographic precision.
From the electronic memory, image planes that cannot be represented with conventional technology can be reconstructed without problems.
Surface and transparency modes also allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different visualization options and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnostics of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first day postoperative.
After transient paresthesia, burning pain in the legs, associated with motor and sensory innervation failure up to segment TH11, developed as a result of the accidental infusion. The disease was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as the one described are usually based on errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but which can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include color marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions, and the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The examination of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension in dental implantology has been neglected up to now.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of jaw crest height and width, 95 toothless bony upper jaws from collections that were standardized sawn, measured and classified were analyzed.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length) 1076 implants were simulated on 269 cross sections and evaluated according to implant type, cross section position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was performed in 24 consecutive implant patients with toothless maxilla in the clinical part of the study.
Implant insertion on the corpse jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but with sufficient jaw height in a further 4.5% could actually be expected.
Implant length reductions were also required in 6%.
There were dependencies, in particular, to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered considerably more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not present in any of the 24 patients.
Primarily insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times a transversally too narrow alveolar crest was revealed only during the operation.
The results allow the quantification of the significance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar crest dimension.
This importance is primarily related to bone height, although even at sufficient height reductions in implant length are often necessary.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain both on the corpse jaw (12% of incisions with expected implantability) and on the patient (8%), for which the mere height measurement fakes false conditions and a precisely planned surgical procedure may have to be aborted.
The complexity and cost of implantological rehabilitation and the extent of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require in principle extended sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to investigate metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
Since tumors exhibit increased glycolysis, these can be detected by radiolabelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven successful in different tumor entities.
In this study, PET was studied in urinary bladder carcinoma lymph node staging.
In 64 patients, a pelvis PET was performed preoperatively after intravenous injection of fluoride-deoxy-glucose (FDG), so that the PET findings could be compared with the histological findings of the surgical specimen after classical surgical lymph node staging.
In lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67 %, a specificity of 86 % and an accuracy of 80 % are calculated.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and appear to be better than the traditional staging methods such as CT and MRI.
In 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were assessed to detect immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal total immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic sinus infections persist despite conservative treatment, a sinus operation that protects the mucous membranes is indicated, but this alone cannot bring the desired success.
Immune subclass deficiency is an indicator of a dysfunctional immune system.
Transitions into severe immune deficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report about a 64-year-old patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamic lesions on the right half of the trunk and on the right leg in the course of the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a marked decrease in lesions.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the “blashkitis of adults” described for the first time in 1990 - are discussed.
The maintenance of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resections increased after nerve-sparing preparation and complete excision of the mesorectum became widespread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of impaired potency and urinary incontinence are found in the literature between 25 and 67 %.
Materials and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were depicted on 10 corpses and 2 formal-fixed, isolated pelvic specimens.
Their situational relationship and possible locations of damage were illustrated and photodocumented during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are clearly anatomically defined structures with little interindividual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense fiber web around the stem of the A. mesenterica inferior (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillier fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated using the standard surgical approach.
1. The nomenclature of fascias and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly clarified in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably leads to damage of sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close situational relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes a sharp preparation under direct view unavoidable.
4. Fascias and nerves can be used as guiding structures in the preparation.
5. The selective protection of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not possible via standard surgical access.
The early detection of second carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is important for prognosis and for therapeutic planning.
In a prospective study from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the lip were panendoscoped as part of the staging procedure to test whether this method could be used for early diagnosis of simultaneous second carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso-, orro-, and hypopharynx.
The end was the microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspected areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second cancers was 8.4%.
Precancerous diseases could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral, Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of second carcinomas in a Primarius in the “head and neck area”.
Based on the good experience so far and the uncomplicated course, this examination obviously does not pose any additional risk to the patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for the staging of head-neck tumors.
Due to the high variability of the clinical picture, the diagnosis of Huntington chorea can cause considerable problems, particularly at the beginning of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Chorea Huntington, in whom psychopathological changes were the main symptomatic over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
Exceptional and thus decisive for the misdiagnosis were the very early onset of the disease and the significantly earlier onset of the disease compared to other sick family members.
However, the phenomenon of the earlier onset of the disease is well documented in the literature in the event of transfer of the mutated gene from the father.
In terms of differential diagnosis, attention was paid to the initially discreet abnormalities of the patient’s movement pattern and the subsequent detailed investigation of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focus:
as climatic therapy, as (balneo-) phototherapy or in a psychosomtic setting.
Since certain patient groups benefit differently, indications for psychosomatic treatment are identified:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychic origin or with psychic involvement in cases of depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation.
In case of problems in the treatment of the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, the importance of orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses in the event of dysfunction in the area of the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle is described.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influence of athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present thesis deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene pans of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to changes in the shape of polyethylene to varying degrees.
The amount of abrasion is measurable by the displacement of the hip head in the pan.
Within the first years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years it settles to values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Head displacement values exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable for prosthetic loosening.
In this study, the center of the hip head in relation to the marker wire of the pan was determined and the head displacement calculated for a total of 369 hip prostheses.
After an average run time of 77 months, 96% of ceramic heads (n = 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used (protasul-2 and protasul-10), only 71% (n = 260) reached this value (duration 61.5 months).
The polyethylene - ceramic sliding pair reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene - metal pairing.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferred.
If there is an indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients unable to give consent, the consent of the caregiver is required to carry out the therapeutic treatment.
Referring to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had assumed that there was a well-founded risk of prolonged damage to health and had affirmed the permit requirement.
However, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis, taking into account the contraindications.
Use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the incidence and severity of cognitive adverse reactions.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs only very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the dangers of the underlying disease.
According to the authors, a guardianship court authorization requirement under the Child Care Act is to be rejected.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is caused by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine in genetically predisposed individuals with autosomal dominant inheritance.
Due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease, the in vitro contractor test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH Group represents the “gold standard” of phenotypic diagnosis for MH predisposition.
On the other hand, mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition are highly correlated.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) in the RYR1 gene could be detected in an individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the agreement with the IVKT were of interest.
The ultrasound diagnosis of childhood malignant lymphomas is described.
Lymphatic system diseases of the child are relatively uniform sonographically:
Initially there are lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disturbances of the normal echotexture usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
In the parenchymatous organs there are essentially 4 patterns of infiltration observed by sonography:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the “bulcky-type”.
Successful ultrasound can be seen in the normalization of the lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organecogenicity and the reversal of tumor- and inflammatory-related complications.
Differential diagnostic indications are derived from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as from the echogenicity and the dual sonographic analysis of blood flow ratios.
The primary diagnosis should always be confirmed histologically.
Background and question.
In transient acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, clinically usually itchy, oedematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles are found predominantly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
Light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocative factors in cases of unknown etiology.
