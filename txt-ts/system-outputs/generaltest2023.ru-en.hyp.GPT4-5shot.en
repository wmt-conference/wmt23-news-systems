The July issue is traditionally handed in during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: proofreading pages when the soul longs to be at Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will talk about the MMKF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, in the minds of the organizers, the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle, which no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at "Kinotavr".
The July issue's cover is adorned with yet another pleasant face - the lead character of the film "Predators", produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Inception" (the man who, by the way, rebooted "Batman..."), the most - no kidding - anticipated film of the summer.
Also, this time we are publishing the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is definitely not necessary to advertise anything specifically, and it is clear to everyone that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moor Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Olli Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, Londoner Evelyn Solt, despite her brilliant service record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will dye herself in the familiar black and set out to seek the truth herself.
Another action film with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal femme fatale promises to further strengthen the actress's position in the action genre.
She will be causing one accident after another, running on walls à la "Matrix" and tossing around burly men in identical strict suits like children.
This is roughly how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, the native, who exploded and repaired the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero-like guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And yet, all together, it turned out not to be a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but the most charming live carnival.
One doesn't want to recall what Besson was doing for 13 years between "The Fifth Element..." and "Adèle...".
He, to put it mildly, was never idle, but all this script-producing hustle and rare, strained directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly likely.
When you watch this movie, it seems like the Besson we knew 13 years ago was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a cafe across the street, and composed a story about a charming adventuress.
To retell the plot (even in broad strokes), stirring up expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
Here, the incredible thrill lies in the fact that surprises await you around every corner or after every line.
And all are pleasant as one.
Either a girl, or a vision.
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADEL
The most daring adventure film of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start like "Amelie", veer towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin only appeared in three films before Adèle.
The actress gained fame for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not chase after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, decorations or tricks, but draws them in, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Forward, my reader, great deeds await us!"
In doing so, Besson approaches genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, with a carefree and cheerful attitude, like a boy who has watched old movies and read a lot of Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid of risk.
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lellouche
PLOT: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was thrown into chaos by an ancient monster, awakened by an old medium.
The police, a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec are all chasing after the fossil creature. Adèle is more concerned with a medium than the beast itself, as she needs to save her sister.
With the same goal, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASES ON JULY 22
"Adèle..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it on a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they both paid tribute to and mocked him here), and finally, with "The Fifth Element" itself.
Besson's style in this film is composed of verbal trickery, actor's clowning, and plot acrobatics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is as organic and strong as ever).
A few words need to be said about Adele herself.
In her, an undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress is embodied, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by sheer audacity and courage.
In movies, such girls are usually paired with some stereotypical macho man or hairy romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
The only one available is a timid and comical sigher, who just keeps getting underfoot (only his knowledge in zoology turns out to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but cheerfully spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Luke Besson, trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely jaded, showed unexpected creative audacity, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors of mega-malls and high-browed regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sorrow, fear, and reproach.
DEATH ROOM
A hermetic horror with claims to psychological depth and political context, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film in 2002 was panned by critics, but was well received by the audience and did well at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
Thus, the young director ended up at a factory that churns out new horrors based on old templates: Bay set out to remake all the classic horror films and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics cringed again, but the audience liked it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new horrors", focusing on excessive physicality of violence.
In general, his example illustrates how an entire genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways to impact an oversaturated audience: the naturalistic gore of splatters merges with the chase scenes of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut film by Vincenzo Natali "Cube". The film was made not by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room", Liebesman had to take a different approach: instead of a mindless slaughter or monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the infamous bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: unite as a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only do they undergo the check, but also a young ambitious special services employee who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor seasoned in wild experiments.
PLOT: For 250 dollars, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a stack of papers with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
The survival game begins, closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for outright art-house.
He can carry on a worldly conversation, and even hit someone in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can't resist any skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and unyielding in her affections.
She is hurt by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly spies on him as he, seemingly parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls", dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, while the father tempts her young suitor from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the generation gap or the choice of profession, which, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Mger Mkrtchan and Pavel Bardina directed a lackluster melodrama, which they turned into a comedy with Ivan Urgant called "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre.
The fragmented plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who constantly discuss psychology, and themselves, apparently by the director's clever idea, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl mutilated in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, a sportsman-alcoholic played by Sergey Gorobchenko), alas, are only outlined in a dotted line.
It's particularly a pity about the line regarding the business of buying and selling football players, which remained off-screen.
PLOT: What worries the football star sales agent most in the world is the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The most compassionate dad changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must definitely marry a guy "with a backbone".
What a disappointment for the businessman when Nastya, in her struggle for independence and to spite her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
However, the author hit the nail on the head with a potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one". You couldn't say it any better.
Their similarity is simply striking.
In both films, there are squads of tough guys, mercenaries forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and in each company, there turns out to be one beautiful girl.
The heroes practically travel through the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both cases something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the set.
Even villains dressed in expensive suits are not easy to distinguish from each other (in both cases they are played by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in "Avatar".
Sylvain White previously filmed about dance battles - "Stomp the Yard".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that was released in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's simply amazing how they, without any collusion, brought different material to an absolutely identical thunderous denominator, making quite heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films, evoking a lot of images with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If one had to choose between these two films, "The Losers" appears slightly more appealing and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least, here we have Zoe Saldana, who looks great with a bazooka.
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungles, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were betrayed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves have been considered dead from that moment.
But they are alive - and are determined to take revenge at all costs on the villain with the languid voice who orchestrated all this.
All this is cute, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White's painting is worth it only if you have absolutely no more interesting options.
Made from recycled materials, conditionally edible fighter.
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict
In a Romanian low-budget film that won an award at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only this data at hand, one can vividly imagine both the hypothetical content of the picture and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the film promises to be socially poignant.
Undoubtedly, it will be realistic, and quite harsh.
High likelihood of non-professional actors participating.
The film will also feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is particularly poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, one could easily mistake what's happening on screen for exercises by some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s.
The film received the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is particularly sought after by directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
Everything said is also true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - it is not at all derogatory, but rather commendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when its representatives have faith in the methods.
She has not yet wavered in her work.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this belief can one endure a ninety-minute spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose story, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be understood.
Convert into a 70s-style exploitation film, with a cowboy deciding to take a walk from jail, where he is soon to be released, to the nearest saloon.
CAST: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: After serving his four-year sentence, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The intrigue with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the film.
What a load of nonsense this all is!
If you want to watch - watch.
A decent debut, giving faint hope that a respectable direction will someday emerge from Romanian art house.
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the aegis of producer Christopher Meledandri, the grey eminence of American animation, responsible, among other things, for all the "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of its team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch in 3D), especially if you love when different objects constantly try to jump out of the screen into the hall), decently written, and most importantly, there is not a single below-the-belt joke, because of which at "Ice Ages" it was necessary to shyly shrink into the chair and cover children's ears with hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the glaring asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is represented by quite harsh black humor (which, one would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very charming movie - so much so that at some point it even seems too perfect and correct.
The meticulous work of a well-coordinated marketing team is evident, who have thought through every detail to ensure the film appeals to all categories of citizens.
Not that we wanted to see the characters of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by a nuclear explosion.
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut have over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to execute his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In a certain advanced shelter, he adopts three female orphans - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, whose degree of cuteness is only comparable to the kitten from "Shrek".
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is drawn from Christopher Meledandri - both are bald, big-nosed, and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part.
A car pulls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a hypothetical desert, from which three pairs of solid breasts emerge.
Exactly so.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently focuses attention on this part of the body.
For the connoisseurs, we immediately share good news - the entire film is made in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about female beauty and the casting was done in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
"The brokeress", "killeress" and "stripperess" are digging in the sand, dousing themselves with water (don't ask why), spouting some nonsense and periodically getting into fierce fights.
The creators believe that a swearing cow with generous curves, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and teeth shining white, is cool.
"Stervoznye Shtuchki" is primarily oriented towards classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena: Warrior Princess" and "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys".
A film of similar spirit in Moscow's distribution - "A Gun for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty twists a thug's balls, a crazy punk fights alongside a Japanese schoolgirl, complete with a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue unfolds through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a movie fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures can be found here.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, while filming this trash-parody, had a lot of fun, but the task itself seems quite strange.
If it weren't for the actresses' physical attributes, it would have become boring by the middle.
One could assume that this wildness came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia boss to the desert, who has diamonds hidden somewhere here worth a substantial amount.
Having achieved nothing and having shot a hapless bandit, the women start to squabble, fight with each other and periodically arriving thugs from somewhere, as well as regularly kissing and cuddling.
As things progress, it turns out that all three are not who they appeared to be at the beginning.
Apparently, the author thinks it's even funnier this way.
A product for a niche group of fans with atrocious taste.
Yes, with his latest film "Doomsday", a ragged "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall made a serious blunder.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and fierce B-movie aesthetics.
The painting also features the hooligan bravado of "Dogs-Warriors", and the beastly cruelty of "The Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" for cleaning up the "peplum" from the stuck post-gladiatorial film dirt, overall, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the story of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough guys, trying to marry their warrior duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
The act of suicide and the spicy details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and circumstance.
The scene of the Ninth Legion's extermination, which consumed a large portion of the budget, is directly inspired by the introductory battle in the German forests from the now iconic "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott. However, there is no desire to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretension.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where Centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is stationed, is ruthlessly destroyed by a Pict scout troop.
Miraculously surviving, Dias is first forced to join the notoriously infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to slip away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Etain (Kurylenko).
The subtle art-house actor has so far only managed to win sharply characterized supporting roles in Hollywood, but there is a strong hope that the situation will change after "Centurion".
Peplum - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", but more modest and harsher.
The continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two extremely promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the bodybuilder werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film adaptation of the animated series about a bald boy wizard, destined to bring peace to four kingdoms.
The Fire Lord instigated a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Cobb's house (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing other people's thoughts and tirelessly works in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the object's dream, he makes the sleeping brain work by his rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in hopes of defeating the evil sorcerer (Alfred Molina) together.
Using destructive spells, they will create chaos with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty has conceived to take over the entire world, and now the dog super-agents are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
A group of hardened killers, led by the seemingly frail Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens hunt them for sport.
The return of the iconic character from the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock-photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very intriguing existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman, hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly understanding human nature.
"A visionary artist of Cobain's scale and the magnificent George Clooney - it's a cinematic union made in heaven," boasts the studio press release.
Furthermore, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney's life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel "A Very Private Gentleman", Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the narrator's role was taken over by the American mentioned in the title, and the main character transformed from an illegal arms dealer to a simple murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to sort out his last case and finally quit his lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Reuten), whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbain's visual experiments, spiced up with Clooney's ash-grey hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead role in the adaptation of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front".
Can I snap a picture of you with my camera!?
This season, Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once.
Firstly, on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" in Venice, directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of "The Rum Diary," an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and I"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of poster artists of the domestic prison drama, there is no doubt about what inspired them.
But one cannot approach the implementation of an idea literally!
However, it's good at least that the heroine of the Russian film, although foreign, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan primarily specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects to their credit: "Happy Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy "Classmates" is released, and the sixth one "The Pretend Wife" starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who made a splash this year with the spectacular action film "Kick-Ass", will take on the reboot of X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first called James McAvoy, casting him as the young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, also known as the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is presumably set to become Magneto.
While the shooting of the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes doesn't have time to get bored.
On his list of works is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel "On the Shore".
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of pragmatic Major George Smiley - the main character in John le Carré's series of novels - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness starred.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Tomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let the Right One In".
Tom Tykwer adapts the science fiction bestseller "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell.
According to the director, it's a challenging task (the novel has six parallel plot lines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been made to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, the shooting of an international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky is taking place, working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It is dedicated to millionaires who have gone to war for their money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film premiere is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside English pop star Pixie Lott.
Megan Fox was fired from "Transformers 3"
As the Ragatoipe film company assures, the dismissal "is not related to that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
Nevertheless, the role of the main heroine and the new love interest of the hero Shia LaBeouf will most likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whitely.
The girl has no experience in film, so she is facing an accelerated course in acting skills.
This fact should not scare the seasoned viewer - there are many examples in the history of cinema of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connelly ("A Beautiful Mind"), Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Runner-Up Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started as models or appeared in fashion magazines, eventually earning a well-deserved "Oscar".
They have excelled in acting skills (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasing, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High rewards are clearly within their reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who earned a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film "Everybody Dies But Me" and directed the controversial TV series "School", has been appointed as the creative director at MT channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, plans are already underway to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Also, Germanika has started casting for new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Twists".
The main theme of the film remains the same - a provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his bride, but is delayed to coach a football team of orphans.
The second plot line of the film has received new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the metropolitan bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
Adding to the intrigue, a third character will appear - Nadya's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the local team will win the football championship, there arises the dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to constant delays in the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of numerous side projects, Guillermo del Toro stepped down from the director's position.
Studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take full control, but he is only willing to take this step in case of dire necessity.
Possible successors include David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film "District 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra.
Driven mad by the gruelling schedule, critics and filmmakers raced at breakneck speed between the Sochi Winter Theatre, where screenings and masterclasses were held, and the "Pearl" hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a continuous stream, barely having time to dip into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved accordingly - in almost every one someone was running somewhere: bewildered Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamuliya's "Another Sky" were looking for a missing grandson and wife, a runaway bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "To Live".
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective story "Who am I?" - who, however, was remembered by the audience more for the presence in the frame of a completely naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared and also in a couple of competitive pictures - in the movie "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a long-distance truck driver transporting a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets pondered on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film production "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to a drinking duel over a lady.
However, even the business events at "Kinotavr" had a noticeable imprint of the show - there was never a dull moment.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house cinema, a colourful argument with critics was staged by Sergey Tolstikov, the chairman of the fund for the support of domestic cinema: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he sternly asked those gathered.
"I write them," the bewildered president of ERVEZS, Andrey Plakhov, replied.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Ovsyanki" was suddenly removed from the competition program - it will go to Venice: the selectors of the Mostra decided that an extra Russian screening would be a hindrance.
Previously, the "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi, films from major festivals were often shown: this time, for example, the film "My Joy" by Sergei Loznitsa, which competed with Mikhalkov and Weerasethakul on the Côte d'Azur, participated in the competition.
Nikita Sergeyevich attended the "Kinotavr" film of his former Cannes competitor and stated that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under the pressure of his colleagues, he was forced to award it a prize for direction.
The award for best debut - "Missing in Action" - was received by the daughter.
A horrifying film encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive, humane, and rational hero is beaten, robbed, and provoked into monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely set, purifying film experience, shot by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, calling for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamuliya refers to films as quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script, and asserts that the viewer's joy lies in the effort to comprehend his elusive meditative films.
The most complex picture of "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a director's star is born.
Impeccably dressed and groomed, the programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the burrow of a neat bachelor's life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, an unjust hand of punitive authorities falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with newcomers," triumphantly announced producer Sabina Eremeeva from the stage, accepting the award.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to bring out the "inner debutant" from the leading figure of domestic art cinema.
And it's symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema, the old guard follows the youth.
And not the other way around.
A documentary film shot in such a way that it blows your mind more than a similar feature film.
The author is interested in both the screwdriver probing the electric meter, and the piece of unsalted butter drifting across the cast-iron pan - all of this transforms the story about the unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a real doc-canvas in oil.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black-and-white aesthetics of the French New Wave to the world of residential districts.
Let Godarov's montage sequences in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other - to play Bach backwards, seem strange, but thanks for the rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the type An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of cloud seeding for the duration of the work, and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemical substances - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrotechnics with silver iodide and powdered reagents, are launched into the sky."
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break up" the clouds heading towards the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, exactly at the place where the cloud was affected.
Work has been underway for about ten years on a remake of a science fiction film in which Michael York played the leading role.
Recently, Carl Rinsch was appointed as the director, who is already scheduled to remake "Creature from the Black Lagoon", and is famous for his commercials.
Previously, the project was associated with the names of Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta") and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy").
According to the plot, the protagonist, who has turned thirty, is forced to flee from a death sentence, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the rotoscope fantasy animation of the 80s and plans to turn it into a large-scale film.
The original was a collaborative creation of director Ralph Bakshi (animated film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and a large amount of drawn breasts.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Teegra and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation for the time being, as he himself plans to work on a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The characters will be brought back to the big screens by none other than Michael Bay - the master of action, explosions, and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the screenplay.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together they filmed "Two Evil Eyes" in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur".
"I wanted to infuse more strength into the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China," says Chen.
— Nowadays, Chinese women are running big businesses and winning Olympic gold.
"Gon Li embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is this a coincidence?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I am representing two films here (at the "Kinotavr" and Sochi film market - EMRBE).
And in both, I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he presented me, and many probably think that's how I am in real life.
Dream girl.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko looks nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground? What was he like on set?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
First, I saw him and thought: "Yes... this won't be easy for me".
Probably, without human contact, sincere and genuine, we would not have achieved anything.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We have, I'm not afraid to say it, become great friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, about how I was afraid that I wouldn't succeed, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this connection, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so, at the premiere, we watched the entire movie holding hands.
How did the shooting in Sevastopol go?
Sevastopol is the city I visited for the first time.
I have never been there on tour, for vacation, or even visited there in my childhood.
This city possesses a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And it's a city you want to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always gets everywhere on time.
So, it wasn't difficult for you to play being in love with this city.
Generally, you are extremely natural on screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy to do?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am, by nature, a very trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, actually, entrust myself into his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will mold.
I perfectly understand that it's easier to see from the outside, and again, I ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time, it's not even me talking to him, but he is having preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, through long, many-hour rehearsals, we arrive at that organic quality you're talking about.
And how was your experience working with the director of the film, Klim Shipenko?
I was thrilled with everyone, the operator, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people so much!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to not sleep, not eat - and this was exactly the situation.
Not to sleep, not to eat for days - and still, whether thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work out - it was a disaster, and something urgently needed to be done to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it's very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so obsessed to the point of painful fanaticism with what they do, it cannot but succeed, because too much energy is expended.
Which scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, carry nothing.
I don't want to work just for the sake of appearing on screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals or projects that you plan to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I am not the person who schedules charts.
The script arrived, it intrigued me, today this premiere happened.

PUBLICITY BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are practically non-stop in Moscow: American cinema - "Amfest", "2togo\", the “2-t-1” will start soon, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of the people I know are constantly discussing who needs to be boycotted and who needs to be supported, based on some - well, excuse me - very vague considerations.
Meanwhile, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying view of ChU4-projection without English subtitles, it seems like nobody notices anything.
The last thing one wants to do is grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket, stay in the hall to watch the gigantic pixels and the horizontal figures of the actors, that's exactly how they will continue to show them to you.
Meanwhile, in our issue, there are no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic film about virtual reality), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), "Unstoppable" (another Tony Scott's approach to the theme of trains) and a wildly detailed story about how the Conan films were made, the barbarian, destroyer and governor.

By the way, the studios are not fools either: in order to prolong the viewer's pleasure and finally squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of Facebook
The new film by David Fincher is, first and foremost, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the internet sphere, which united the whole world, estranged five friends, and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is just as magnificent, portraying our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of resentment towards the world around him, partly out of competitive interest, and partly just because IT'S "cool".
The very idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and impromptu, but the actual course of events suggests a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the sharp, hard-hitting dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain momentum here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins played by actors who don't resemble each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed onto the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman was studying at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
DIRECTOR David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Joshua Pence.
PLOT: A gloomy and introverted Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, after facing a setback in his personal life, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few friends and partners begin to deteriorate, eventually leading to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, at times sunny, remaining cozy even in the darkness, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Beyond the stream of endless discussions, not much happens in the film: no deaths, no murders, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles hardly make for an additional paragraph on his sparse Wikipedia page.
What attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story that is not too generous with details?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and the understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just about twenty years ago, "Wall Street" was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now, as the daily solvency has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful, and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, "The Social Network" could easily have been turned into a dark comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his case - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a con artist?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But here it won't even be necessary: in their version of the story, it doesn't matter at all.
"What's it like to feel beautiful?" - is asked in the song by Tre VeNez "VaBu Uoc'te A Vsp Map", preceding the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The movie hints at the answer.
Zuckerberg represents a lost online generation, which has a weak understanding of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile internet-era trial.
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin was alive, surnames had not yet properly begun to appear among people of humble origin.
They used to be named as "so-and-so, son of so-and-so".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames based on the father's name.
But sometimes, for example in the case of a father's repeated marriages, a matronymic was used - a nickname based on the mother's name.
Susanin - is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susan".
The serfs of small landowners indeed went without surnames for a long time - what's the need for it when you have 20 souls and everyone is constantly in sight.
But the owners of large estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Yes, the serfs of Prince Andrey Cherkassky already had surnames en masse at the beginning of the 18th century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the land, but let him go on quitrent - let him earn with a craft and pay the landlord.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname should be written.
In the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of the serfs were released on quitrent.
And that means, they already had surnames.
Capital city forensic experts flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk.
Forensic experts from the central office and staff from the forensic center have arrived in Novosibirsk to assist with the investigation of a gas explosion in a house on Lineynaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked carelessly, and on the contrary, overcharged for their services, reports the agency citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments in building № 39, where they were changing the stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments, they installed a water hose instead of a gas one.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, it's impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leak and explosion occurred in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the death of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of a house explosion in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In Petersburg, they managed to avoid a storm surge.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding sharply increased in St. Petersburg due to bad weather in the city.
The marine storm surge was successfully prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have been the 32nd in a row, reports the St. Petersburg publication Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at a level of 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, which at times reached speeds of 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and vessels can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
Note that the water level situation is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This allows to prevent flooding that may follow an increase in wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in connection with the shortcomings in the collapsed buildings.
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people have been arrested in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, this was announced by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of injured exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighbouring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the country's president.
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Prime Minister's Office of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, states:
"Your Eminence,
I warmly congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
The warm and friendly Armenian-Iranian relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions hold special significance for both our countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing a steady and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, forged in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will achieve even greater accomplishments in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you good health and many years of life".
In the congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi, it particularly states: "Your Excellency, please accept heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The unshakeable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries of history and mutual respect, hold special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts, we will be able to elevate our intergovernmental cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the prosperity of our two friendly nations and the security of our countries.
Emphasising the importance of our views on establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation extended to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
Taking this opportunity, I wish you new achievements, and to the friendly people of Iran - stable peace."

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II era bomb exploded on Friday as bomb disposal experts attempted to defuse it.
A powerful explosion could be heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
The Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after the defusing process began.
Fortunately, all the personnel are safe.
"Agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Chief Assistant Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social media that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Caption to the photo: The explosion occurred contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no fatalities or injuries.
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yare River, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand embankment around it, and a cordon, into which outsiders were not allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Initially, on Thursday, the bomb disposal experts planned to use a robot to cut off the detonator from the bomb, but the attempt was unsuccessful. Then, as reported by the local press, they decided to use the technique of "slow burning" the explosives.
During this combustion process, an explosion occurred.
During the Second World War, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the proportion of women among researchers is 38.9%, reported BELTA scientific employee Alesya Solovey of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: women make up 41.1% of candidates of sciences and 21% of doctors of sciences.
In all fields of science, except for technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which women make up 64.4%.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among the candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
Among the faculty in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and upbringing work, every third one is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The majority of women are among senior lecturers and teachers - over 60%.
There is a high proportion of women among associate professors in the department composition (55.2%).
According to the republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's capabilities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype that "science is a male field of activity" to some extent.
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in mass consciousness of gender perceptions about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentorship," noted Alesia Solovey.
Every year on February 11, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated.
The holiday was established to encourage women and girls to engage in the field of science, to promote the development of scientific careers by women, and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO data, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The likelihood of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction.
Such a statement was made by the Chairwoman of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently occurred.
On one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the economic situation is shaping up better than the October forecast.
There is a continued shift in the structure of demand: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, overall inflationary risks have increased.
"Therefore, in the current year, the likelihood of a rate increase exceeds the likelihood of its decrease.
"The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to a more pronounced influence of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, a rapid increase in consumption in the context of heightened inflation expectations, in case the factors restraining consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of labor and the growth of labor productivity is lagging behind the growth of wages.
Also, there remains the risk of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairwoman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and the next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased."
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that a certain rate hike may be needed in 2024 to bring inflation in line with the target of around 4%," concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure of creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (MIF), consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the composition of the current retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets and the resumption of operations with investment shares.
If more than 10% of the retail mutual fund consists of blocked securities, then the management company must allocate them into a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
However, the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay the owners of investment units at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, according to a statement from the Bank of Russia.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts also provided a forecast for the current year.
According to the Analytical and Expertise Center of Promsvyazbank, in 2022, passenger turnover of air transport in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation decreased by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year's level, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights, arranged by Rostourism.
Several state support programs were also implemented to ensure the availability of air transportation, including subsidizing citizen transportation, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and recapitalize "Aeroflot" with 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanction pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continued subsidization of the industry by the state (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, up to 103.0 million people," - share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, a 6-year-old child killed.
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car at high speed crashed into a bus stop.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that it was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified as a terrorist act by law enforcement agencies, the terrorist's relatives have been detained, and the house has been sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental health issues and was just discharged from the hospital this week.
Austria is once again tightening control at the border with Hungary following another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people are staying at the border in their cars, waiting to cross over to the Austrian side.
Thus, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already undergone the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That's why, according to the police, there is a need for increased control.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed the promise of European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones, and watchtowers to guard the borders of the union.
According to Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and applying for refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time, amounting to over 330,000.
The cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS.
The automatic resupply ship "Progress 83" successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 Greenwich Mean Time, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The docking broadcast was led by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was monitored by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by astronauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin, and Anna Kikina.
The "Progress MS-22" spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian astronauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported a depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent flooding on February 18.
As clarified by the company's press service, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the general volume of the ISS.
"The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
Also, the Mission Control Center reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
The crew's life and health are not in danger, they are feeling well.
"There has been an increase in cases of birth tourism."
How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine migration service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not stay to live in the country.
Previously, the republic's authorities denied entry to several pregnant Russian women, suspected of arriving for the purposes of "birth tourism".
On February 11th, they were finally allowed into Argentina by court decision.
More details can be found in the "Gazeta.Ru" article.
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained it through the birth of a child, but did not stay to live in the country.
This was reported to C5N channel by the service director Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian will be considered in court, the immigration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Karinyano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this backdrop, it was reported on February 9th that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina due to being denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission associates the incident with the possibility that the republic's authorities may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more - on the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women had arrived in Argentina, but these three specifically were issued a prohibition from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the immigration law, where one of the grounds for denial of entry is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin explained.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by court decision, allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country, reported lawyer Christian Rubilar.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes his words.
Rubilar noted that the immigration service changed its decision following a court ruling.
Foreign parents of a child born in Argentina find it easier to obtain a republic passport.
It allows for short-term trips to 171 countries without a visa, including EU countries, the UK, and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "boom in birth tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, between 2,000 and 2,500 citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could increase to 10,000," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously stated that in 2022, about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it was reported how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has become 10% cheaper.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become 25% more expensive across the country, reports Patrolny Petersburg citing RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine migration service denied entry to six pregnant Russian women, as the purpose of their visit, which they had stated, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS, citing the Todo Noticias channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In connection with this, the country's representatives did not let Russian women into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the immigration service has a procedure in place if there are suspicions about "fake" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly explain where she is going to rest, she immediately becomes suspicious to the immigration service.
Moreover, experts clarify that it's hard to be a traveler "under such conditions".

Filippenko noted that the management was accommodating and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that "he didn't let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is planning to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, currently the film actor is working in a Moscow theater as a guest actor.

Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman.
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
A fisherman sued the music performer Philipp Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his suburban cottage.
This is reported by "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As clarified by the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff with no chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11th.
The celebrity lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he will ask Kirkorov to provide his balcony for the plaintiff's fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot there is an opportunity to cast the spinning rod further.
The sleep specialist named the reasons for sleep problems.
Sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova talked about food and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise from products containing caffeine.
Primarily, it's about tea, coffee, chocolate, and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "fragmented", thus preventing the body from fully recovering.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before sleep.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a result - difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, the somnologist recommends avoiding spicy food and large portions.
Large volumes of food and spicy meals can increase the body's internal temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to maintain an external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of an elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, one should not overindulge in heavy food before sleep, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, therefore it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

In France on Saturday, hundreds of protests against pension reform will take place.
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.
After a certain decrease in the number of participants in protest actions last Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", trade unions hope this time to bring more protesters to the streets, taking into account those citizens who did not have the opportunity to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies are expecting between 600,000 to 800,000 protesters across the country, including between 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, according to media reports.

The next mass protest actions are planned for February 16th.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented a government-developed pension reform project, which envisages raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 years old.
It is assumed that the set retirement age threshold will gradually shift from 62 to 64 years old, by three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new regime will be applied, starting with the generations of French people born in September 1961 or later.
During his 2022 election campaign, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his determination to carry out pension reform by the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's pension reform project.

The "Progress MS-21" depressurization occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported a depressurization of "Progress MS-21", prepared for undocking from the ISS, reports MIA "Kazinform" citing TASS.
"The contour of the cargo ship "Progress MS-21", which is scheduled to be flooded on February 18, has been depressurized, confirmed by telemetry data received at the Mission Control Center," - reported in the press service of Roscosmos.
As noted, he is currently isolated from the general volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the cargo ship "Progress MS-22", nor the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented on by Sergey Krikalev, the Executive Director of Roscosmos for manned space programs.
"A coolant leak occurred in the thermal regulation system of a cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months."
"The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS note) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure there are no issues with future launches.
"We need to conduct a thorough analysis to ensure that this cause does not extend to similar structures in future launches.
"Here is the main task that will now stand before us," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis is to be conducted from the perspective of preparing the ship for launch, the materials used, and the technologies employed in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was conducted in the case of the damaged radiator of the "Soyuz MS-22" spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure it's not some kind of systematic error," added Krikalev.
The CEO clarified that on Saturday a commission began its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to undock and descend from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz ship ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note), so there will be no serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work... From this point of view, it will not affect the program," noted Krikalev.
The "Progress MS-21" truck was launched from Baikonur on the "Soyuz-2.1a" carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, he docked with the small research module "Search" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the site of the "Progress" depressurization.

The fitness expert talked about outdoor winter workouts for weight loss.
A fitness expert named winter walks as a great way to lose weight without intensive workouts.
Fitness expert Anthony Eng spoke about an effective interval training outdoors for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the portal Eat This, Not That.
A specialist named active winter walks as an excellent way to lose weight without intensive loads, as well as to improve the condition of the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"Walk at a normal pace for the first five to ten minutes to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute without breaking into a run.
"One minute - at a normal pace," explains Eng.
Three attempts are required.
Next, the specialist advises to do lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, followed by walking at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
Repeat this sequence five times. Then Eng suggests alternating the active step (two minutes) and the calm one (one minute) three more times.
Finish the walk with a five-minute stroll at a leisurely pace and a few stretching exercises.
All you need for this workout is 35 minutes in the fresh air.

The Deputy General Director of Russian Railways proposed to the Governor of the Irkutsk Region to develop new sales directions.
It is necessary for the Irkutsk region to continue exploring alternative sales channels, apart from the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the Deputy Director of Russian Railways, Alexey Shilo, at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, as reported by the regional government on February 10, 2023.
- As last year's experience showed, despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this decision can be extremely effective.
"It is important for the logistics services of companies to constantly interact with our 'neighbors' (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal pricing conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes," emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The Governor emphasized the importance of stable product shipment, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of product exportation negatively affects the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of the monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical industry products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will strive to do everything to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
"If there are additional volumes for domestic market shipments, we are also ready to assist in this direction," said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages Granovshchina and Khomutovo.
On behalf of the regional head Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of Priangarye, Konstantin Zaitsev, was working in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo in the Irkutsk region today.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Prime Minister familiarized himself with the work of the new educational institution - Granovskaya School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The eight school blocks house: classrooms, a dining room, a food unit, an assembly hall, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative offices, toilets, common recreation areas, and a medical unit.
The construction was funded with 240.8 million rubles from the federal budget, over 512 million rubles from regional funds, and over 72 million rubles from municipal funds.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment amounting to 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening, in addition to the children from the village of Granovshchina, students from the Urikovskaya school, which was undergoing major repairs, also attended.
More than 100 educators conduct the classes, nearly 90 of them are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus, purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under a federal program.
The major renovation of Khomutovskaya Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
Primary school students were assigned to Homutovskaya School No. 1, while older students attend the second building of School No. 2.
According to the renovation plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows and associated elements will be replaced here, the facade will be repaired, and the interior finishing of the premises will be carried out.
An important component of major repairs is the restoration of the heating point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all the work is over 80 million rubles.
The repair is in the final stage, there are problems with connecting to the power grid - there is a need to increase the power, work is underway with the power supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to the electrical grid by developers.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week for the legal resolution of these issues.
- Very often, the question of stable electricity supply is a main condition when buying a house, because people are increasingly using electric power for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, which is already a basis for disconnecting power supply.
Therefore, network companies in areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.
Anatoly Prokopyev evaluated the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant-farm enterprises UOBO.
The head of the UOBO, Anatoly Prokopyev, visited three farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
The head of the farm in Kapsal village, Yulia Madaeva, received a grant to develop her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main areas of the farm's activity is the production of livestock products.
The livestock population increases annually, and the gross production of meat and milk is growing.
Later, thanks to state support, there was an opportunity in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy livestock farm.
As of today, the farm has about 150 head of cattle, 60 of which are cows.
In addition, they engage in the cultivation of cereal crops and sow annual fodder crops here.
Thanks to the activities of the KFH (Farm Household) of Victor Katanayev, the area of Kharyashino in the village of Kulunkun has been reclassified as a populated area.
The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy livestock farm for 60 heads.
As of today, the livestock population is 150 head of cattle.
Also, for many years, they have been engaged in potato cultivation here.
The head of the farm is striving to create all the necessary conditions for work and living for the team.
Now there is a whole village on the farm's territory.
Anatoly Prokopyev has personally taken control of the issue of constructing two kilometers of road from the Kharyashino area to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of the KFH Stalina Mogzoeva in the village of Otonkhoy are breeding cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection and received the "AGROSTARTUP" grant for the development of meat farming.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers, and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the livestock population and boosts the gross production of meat.
In addition, the farm grows annual fodder crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a fattening site.
Following the visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that the measures of state support are effective, needed, necessary.
- The Irkutsk Region Government pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, state support should not only be maintained, but also increased and enhanced.
In turn, we must be the guarantor of food security.
The agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor, - emphasized Anatoly Prokopyev.
The Armenian-Turkish border crossing was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
The Margara-Alijan border point on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same transition was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake in 1988, notes the Turkish agency "Anadolu".
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, according to Serdar Kilic, Ankara's special representative in the Armenian-Turkish negotiations.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, Ruben Rubinyan, and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia, Vaan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help provided by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kylıç wrote on his Twitter page.
The Press Secretary of the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vaan Unanyan, in turn, reported that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border via the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
As reported by Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency "Anadolu" provides different data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border point was last used for delivering humanitarian aid to Armenia to mitigate the consequences of the devastating earthquake in 1988.
Then, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster area in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, over 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from a devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that there are already known to be 21,848 fatalities in Turkey.
From the Syrian side, it was reported that 3553 people had died.
The relations between Turkey and Armenia are primarily overshadowed by Ankara's refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air travel between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening a land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

If you need him to play in the Makélélé position, he can play there very well.

He made a big mistake and for most people, he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a footballer-lawbreaker.
But he is still far from Kokorin.
Because no one managed to waste their potential as much as Kokorin did.
Despite all his talents, Mamaev was periodically noticeable.
"I can only wish him luck and to find fulfillment somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev.
The last club of the 34-year-old midfielder was "Khimki".
The suburban club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.

A tanker carrying diesel from a vessel previously sailing under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain.
The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport of Spain has banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo originates from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, according to the Spanish Ministry of Transport.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the ship "Maersk Magellan" flying the Singapore flag, because the cargo it carries comes from the ship under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022, sailed under the Russian flag," - says the statement of the ministry.
The measure was taken in accordance with European Union legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022, or that changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which a ban was agreed upon.

The problems encountered by pregnant Russian women trying to enter Argentina have been explained.
According to a specialist's assessment, due to the influx of people wishing to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have started to monitor more closely the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
The difficulties with pregnant Russian women entering Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a mass influx of foreigners wanting to obtain citizenship for their children and residency for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru", citing Professor Viktor Heifetz of SPbGU, the editor-in-chief of the "Latin America" journal.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina, they do not approve of the country becoming a transit point, rather than a final destination.
This concerns those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant Argentine passports to the parents after obtaining residency will be made by the court.
In case it turns out that they actually did not live in Argentina and left immediately, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, birthing tours to Argentina have become especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Let's remember, Argentina grants citizenship by "jus soli", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport allows for visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the United Kingdom.
It was previously reported that Argentina has begun revoking the residence permits of Russians who obtained the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such incidents.
It has also been reported that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry into Argentina due to suspicions of providing false information about the reasons for their trip.
In Russia, they predict the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs.
In Russia, there is a resurgence of citizens' interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
In the current year, the country may open more than 400 new facilities, predominantly small-format.
In Russia, about 400 new fitness clubs may open, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
As reported by "Kommersant", at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with minimal initial investments and quick returns.
Such data is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
The President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, Olga Kiseleva, noted in a conversation with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
The President of NFS, Elena Silina, noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures each year than openings.
Over the last three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
However, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to "Kontur.Focus", over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity "fitness center operation" has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered significant losses due to the pandemic, however, it began to recover as early as 2021.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians have started to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in fitness club attendance.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year on year.
As Silina noted, if the trend continues, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The management company from Kirov had their license revoked.
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region has annulled the business license for managing apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled a license for entrepreneurial activity in managing apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
The arbitration court revoked the "management company's" license because the organization repeatedly ignored the orders of the State Housing Inspection.
Currently, all the properties that were under the management of "Zaboty" have been removed from the register of licenses for conducting entrepreneurial activities in managing apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The administration of Kirov is aware that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspection informed the city hall about the current situation.
Recall, in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set a task for the State Housing Inspection staff to eliminate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the communists of Kirov.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to hold Sokolov accountable for administrative liability.
Presumably, the same position could have been taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service as well.
The antitrust authorities also reportedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the regional leader's actions.

Previously, Wildberries customers accused the platform of deducting funds from cards, the details of which had previously been removed from the personal account.
As buyers fear, this is associated with great risks to safety.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As per the policy, the company has the right to deduct money from the removed cards without notifying the customer, if the payment from other cards does not go through for various reasons.
The company, commenting on the situation, stated that transactions with customers are carried out with the customers' consent, and there can be no leakage of bank card data.
Photos from February 2023.
A beautiful place especially in the summer, around the mammoth sculpture there are gazebos with barbecues.
There is a small park on the territory where you can take a walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City Shopping Center.
Operating hours are from 10:00 to 22:00.
In the store, you can have a coffee and snack on fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot near the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a wide selection of syrups and alternative milk.
The most delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Comfortable cafeteria area
Came with my daughter to arrange a pension.
We were warmly welcomed, everything was explained clearly, documents were scanned, the application was processed, and we were informed about how to schedule subsequent appointments.
Upon entering, the administrator and security greet you in a cultured and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would not hurt to get a water cooler.
Visited twice, everything was great!
I wish all workers peace, kindness, good luck, and a decent salary during these challenging times for everyone!!!
Just a magnificent place!
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine, waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply exquisite!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The sweet cashier asked me if I wanted my coffee to go or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for it in the hall, 300 ml.
In a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to do ceramics, hence "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I'm asking, why in a small glass, and not in a cup.
The girl responds, saying they don't have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
How does that fit into a person's mind?
Ask whether to take away or have in, i.e. decide for yourself the method: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that, 300 ml.
To confront a person with the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
Interestingly, this is the third such case in Zelenaya Okolitsa in my memory.
It's doubly noteworthy that I wasn't offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I want. I had to ask for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
Is the Green Outskirts Cafeteria and the Green Outskirts two sides of the same coin or are they unrelated organizations?
If not related, understanding appears.
If they are related - why has a food and trade enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, stooped to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, is happening to me for the third time.
I don't rule out that it's happening not only to me.
Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acts on instinct.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please outline the actions for your employees in this case, especially if you are trying to provide service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the performances with Yuri Nikulin himself.
And now even with children, nephews and nieces.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and the programs too.
The location of the places is very convenient.
Practically from any point, the arena is visible and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not obstruct your view.
The circus is very intimate, family-oriented!
This time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a bit upset.
Many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with magic tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and continue to delight us with your performances!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, they choose good locations for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before purchasing, we were invited to view the complex when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although we had looked at many apartments and no developer had offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The best thing is the gentle sparse forests, especially when there's a lot of soft snow.
But in my opinion, the tracks are a bit boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector E, it's still more or less there.
But overall, the atmosphere is excellent, with many different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
Did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a cloakroom and water.
Terrible service.
For the second time, I arrive to pick up my order at the readiness time indicated in the app and wait at the window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Such service is unacceptable in business today!
The response from the "care" service - we are trying.
At the cashier, without even an apology, they simply said - it's not our fault, it's the program.
You didn't find a way to call and warn, or any other technical means of communication with previously loyal customers.
"Impotents try", but business must work.
Thank you everyone, let's all disperse.
We will no longer be placing orders with you, let alone recommending you.
A spoiled mood, expecting guests, the hostess's apologies - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was expected to be received in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation at the border between Lithuania and Belarus (which Lithuania was dealing with).
In the end, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional consultations and normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a small house for 4 days for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, warm (even very), each cabin has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary dishes.
Cleaning detergent and a sponge are available.
Among the disadvantages, one could mention the lack of space, and the bathroom has an incredibly small shower.
There is no provision for storing snowboards or skis, and there is hardly any place to dry things. We had to borrow a dryer from the hosts and squeeze it in place of a chair, and put a heater under it.
Overall, it's a decent option in a quiet location.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the selection of dishes is sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There is wine and beer available for those who wish to drink.
Center of Moscow, recommended.
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
The property has all the necessary amenities, including parking and a billiard room.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked around during our visit to Kaliningrad.
Really enjoyed it, both Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural hills for kids to play on.
A very cool shop for tobacco and hookahs)
We always shop here, the prices are low and the quality is on point!
Very responsive staff, they will advise and answer all your questions)
I highly recommend this store for everyone to visit! ❤️
Location as convenient for everyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They provide service quickly, unless any of the visitors are being slow.
It's convenient by appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will guide, direct, and even consult if you come on non-reception days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, prices are reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote was for the trash, but these smart guys fixed everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery in 2 hours for March 8th.
They delivered the flowers in packaging six hours later, as if they were stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
Decided to recount and it turned out that there are an even number of tulips, 20 pieces.
The support on WhatsApp responded to my complaints about the color and quantity of flowers with "apparently the color was mixed up".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think this is the height of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already submitted a statement to the tax authorities regarding the refusal to issue me a receipt.
Next in line are the Consumer Rights Protection Authority and the court.
I do not recommend dealing with this organization.
I have been going to the stylist Samira for over 10 years, for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to commend the professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I confidently recommend this master to all my relatives and close ones.
All her work is always performed at the highest level!!!
Huge thanks to Master Samira 😍
I've been to this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are many gaming computers, and there are also drinks and food available.
Among the downsides, some keyboards are broken with keys flying off, if we consider the "usual gaming process", the computers don't perform well :(
Therefore, a rating of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to his group activities, while the mom goes to fitboxing in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize themed parties for children, maintain cleanliness and look after the gym equipment.
It's pleasant to walk and exercise.
A 6-year-old child already takes a hit well, strong physical training.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
Best masters!
Irina is simply gold!!
The work is done with quality, care, and attention to detail.
You can always have a chat about something with girls!
It was the third time!
I will never regret anything!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching!!!
Also, Vita is studying color theory.
Therefore, she will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
Service advisor Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the regular maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
Also, gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional execution of the work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was done well.
The only thing that was confusing when scheduling the maintenance was the insufficiently clear information about the work schedule. Upon arrival for the maintenance, the schedule was more clearly explained.
I want to express my deep gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
I needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction. The staff were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, even though they could have refused, as it is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very heartfelt people work here.
Wonderful, heartfelt, polite staff, I did not regret coming to this hair salon!👍
Master Nahida did a flawless highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend to everyone❤️
Really enjoyed the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it was great too.
And I highly recommend the Russian collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection.
We have known Olya for over 3 years and use her services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olga develops in her favorite business, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged friends, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with a calm soul.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will pick up/drop off by pet taxi.
And they will also deliver it clean and tasty)
It's just a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for the care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Satisfied Moose restaurant is located near Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is diverse.
It is advisable to reserve seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
A lovely well-kept zoo.
Less than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
Visited on a weekday - adult entrance fee is 300₽, student fee is 170₽.
There were not many people, we enjoyed a walk and looked at the animals.
The anteater impressed)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices on the premises, clean free toilets, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
A top-notch salon!!!
Very satisfied with the services of the cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I perform various facial cleansings - both machine and manual.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
She explains everything in detail about the skin's characteristics, she selected skincare products that perfectly suit my skin type.
Now I walk around happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you, Natalia!!!
Excellent club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam, and great trainers!
One of the downsides is the large number of retirees in the pool and changing area.
It feels like they come to the club as if it's a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 7:00 PM, there are a lot of people!
I give it a three, and that's only thanks to the first visit when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
Everything was arranged quickly, all the pros and cons were explained clearly, my son also decided to get a card, but alas, the consultants were busy with their own affairs, customers were waiting, a consultant who didn't care about anything eventually approached my son, he went into the negotiation room several times, discussing something cheerfully, as a result, my son left without arranging anything, the consultant said goodbye, well, if you don't want to, as you wish, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of staff.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their assortment, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim person and a child with non-standard figure and height.
Located near the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommended!
It was in September, I was celebrating my birthday.
In principle, we liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are of average size, so you can get full, or you can order again.
The only complaint - table reservation.
When I placed the order, I provided the number and everything that was required, after which a bot immediately called to verify the phone.
Nothing further.
When I arrived at the restaurant, it turned out that the table had not been reserved.
We were lucky that there were free spaces and they managed to accommodate us.
Actually, it's a very good restaurant with an excellent "Price/Quality" ratio.
I recommend!
Went for a cleaning this past weekend.
This is the first time I've seen such an organized staff, who were extremely attentive to my many questions, and advised on what would be best for my future dental treatment.
I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only clinic in my memory that doesn't want to rip you off.
Good shopping mall.
Everything is there!
A wide range of products.
Variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
I will not set foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said it's out of town, so we'll deliver it ourselves.
The manager in the hall told me where to drive up to the warehouse, when asked "will they load?" he said yes. ))
They brought it out of the warehouse without a box, when asked why? They replied that's how everything is loaded.
When I insisted, they shoved in two strips of foam plastic, as if that would do!
They refused to load into the trailer, saying it's not their job, load it yourself, they only do delivery )))
When I said that I would then refuse the order altogether, they said "do as you want, we don't care", in the end one of them condescended to come down the ramp and help my father shove the car into the trailer.
I'm encountering such rude service for the first time.
Good shopping center. Clean and tidy. A large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" and an entertainment children's center "Neverland".
On the ground floor is a large "Lenta" hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking and convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear, and home goods.
A diverse range of products, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the selection, they will provide consultation.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend the evening.
The staff is very good, a pleasant establishment.
I highly recommend it, you will never go wrong with your choice. It's the best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be superb.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Chasovaya, who was our agent in organizing the funeral.
Upon arriving at our request, she took upon herself the resolution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything necessary, was always in touch and informed us about the progress.
Thanks to her, we were able to give a dignified farewell to our loved one.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized, as we discussed at our first meeting.
Marina, fully understanding the condition of our loved ones, gave advice on what would be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
This is a very good specialist in their field.
Thank you for everything.
Flattered by numerous positive reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and they assigned me the master Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that he is completely free the next day and ready to provide services.
Everyone discussed and set the time - 14:00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master stating that he won't be able to come, a complex request (how so? where is "completely free?") and, if he can, he will arrive after 18:00 instead of the scheduled 14:00.
Agreed to meet again the next day.
15 minutes before the scheduled time, another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned tasks set aside!
In short, a competent master named Ivan came, fixed the breakdown, for which we thank him.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time in vain.
The evening observations completely failed to meet expectations.
First, there was a small lecture with unclear material, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children were climbing to watch several times, adults were crowding and could not let others watch.
The objects we viewed through the telescope were the size of a regular star, and can also be viewed without a telescope for free.
The girl answered the questions in a way that was not very accessible, not understanding that ordinary people are not aware of many nuances.
It's unclear what the 600 rubles is for.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
Average price tag.
To sit and eat 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + a cocktail each, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Borracho is highly recommended to try.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
And in general, the restaurant has very delicious food, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will definitely recommend my friends to go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying their products for quite a long time, since they first opened.
Good quality goods.
I bought a mixer, it's been five years already, and it's still working properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when we did a major renovation in the apartment, we got everything we needed right here.
Excellent refueling!!!
It's very conveniently located, both close to the city center and the outskirts, overall very convenient!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up twice a week for over 2 years now, no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Chicks are sold by card and cash, they don't cheat on the volume.
I liked the store!
You can choose any model, at an affordable price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to assist in selection.
I bought a laptop for my daughter for her studies, as her old one broke down.
Helped, selected, gave a warranty (month). Thank you! 👍
Works as a sommelier.
He helped with the wine selection, because it's hard to navigate such a large menu on your own.
The experience of working with the interesting, charming sommelier Vasily is unique, there aren't enough like him in Moscow.
Eating pike perch is magical, respect to the chef.
The kids' menu is the same as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken patties. Mine ate pizza, it's AMAZING here!
The truffle was appreciated by adults, while the children enjoyed the ham and mushrooms.
The husband ate smoked ribs - they were bomb, soft, juicy, aromatic.
The staff is nice, everyone is smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
A brand new WB pickup point is conveniently located.
Working hours, from 10.00 to 21.00, without days off and holidays.
Inside the pickup point, there are fitting rooms.
A very good place.
Here, real professionals work who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on WhatsApp for informative communication.
Quick issuance.
It's pleasing that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great that it's near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean, and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a wide selection of dishes to suit any taste.
Convenient access, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to various performances.
Today we attended the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best children's performance.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even the 14-year-old son, who just went along for the company, said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I vacationed for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a "5 out of 5", loved everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called to confirm what time to expect us, provided information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850), got there quickly, there were no traffic jams, and we were let through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, the process was quick, took about 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - that's a big plus!
The double room is spacious, with warm floors in both the room and the bathroom (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is standard, there is a dressing table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not too small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linen at your request, but if you don't ask for a change, they still change it on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-maintained, with benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus runs to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
5 minutes to the public transport stop.
In the dining hall, friendly guys always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but it depends on what you're here for, we were perfectly satisfied with both the selection and quality, there was always fish, chicken and patties or similar, vegetables as a side dish every day, tasty homemade pastries, more than 4 drinks, grain coffee, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, just the cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 C°, sunny.
We liked everything, we really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again, specifically in January, when there are fewer vacationers)).
It's a pity that the swimming pool and the gym complex will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire sanatorium staff for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We've been going to "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I could never have imagined that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering the streets of Petersburg, my friends and I decided to check out this promising establishment - and we were not disappointed!
The prices are quite affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in an instant, not even a crust remains.
A pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend :)
It so happened that I ended up in the Tomarovskaya hospital with high blood pressure and a fast heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning twice, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is dietetic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is attentive, everyone is capable of giving both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the IV is still in, they will come in and ask about how you're feeling...
I've had heart ultrasounds before, but this is the first time like this (unfortunately, I don't know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the treating doctor, Klavdia Fedorovna Vetokhina!
A true professional: attentive, knowledgeable, provides comprehensive answers to any question; she selected the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heart rate, something I couldn't achieve after consulting with other doctors.
A huge thank you to the chief physician Olga Vladimirovna Mevshe, who organized the smooth operation of the hospital!!!
Thanks to both the medical staff and the janitors, and the cooks!
The impression left by visiting the customer service was good.
Met the administrator in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently assist clients with all their inquiries.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and provided clarification on my question.
For a small shop, there's quite a good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, dairy, vegetables, household chemicals, various small things.
Operates 24/7, which is very convenient, always friendly staff.
It's cool when there's a place in the city where you can go downhill.
T-bar lifts and on weekends of course there will be a queue, it takes 40 seconds to descend and a 5-10 minute wait.
But overall, it's cool, immersing in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I turned to the service for iPhone 11 Pro repair.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I directly contacted the master Alexander, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done with high quality.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate with, they will show and tell you everything.
However, during the replacement of parts, the camera was disturbed, the focus was off.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
The prices, compared to other services, are reasonable and appealing.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Grand, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, it is in a condition that requires the close, prompt, and quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers.
Excellent LCD
Responsive concierges, garbage is taken out, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
A nice, cozy place to relax has opened in our area.
All necessary shops are available.
A killer and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are arranged in cozy areas.
No congestion.
Well, we visited, we tried...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian cafe...
The space is very limited, the tables are rectangular, like in a cafeteria.
Pizza... well, those who haven't tasted something more delicious will like it. To me, it seemed somewhat bland.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is always standing behind you and almost always looking at the face of your interlocutor opposite.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come here anymore and won't recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf - the best stylist I have ever had for haircuts and coloring.
She does everything very neatly and of high quality, I enjoy going to her, knowing that everything will be done excellently.
I also only take my daughter to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We're from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, kind people from KatResource quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, we need more good people like you!
And it's clean and nice in the service there!
Came for Sergey Chigrakov's concert.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year for the scheduled concerts.
A peaceful place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, with live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Stunning Georgian cuisine!
The highest rating, I adore this place ❤
A park in the city center, very easy to reach.
The park is clean, there is space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the children's playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages to our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be purchased at Perekrestok.
The staff is welcoming.
I didn't come across any bad products.
Frequent promotions and discounts.
It's nice that it's close to home.
You can always find a parking spot.
Visited the bar twice, liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, the DJs know their stuff.
The only thing, the second time disappoints the soloist of the band "Hands Up Band".
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very well, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, especially striking when these were songs by the band "Ruki Vverh".
Somehow it's illogical (performing in the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band).
We took a vacation in early March.
Good hotel, pleasant rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo, and towel change.
The breakfasts are simply mind-blowing.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to your room, you will pay a 20% service charge on top.
The prices at the restaurant are slightly inflated.
Tastes like a three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was simply amazing.
Everything was wonderful, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no safe travels.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help to open the door seeing a woman with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on to maintain the brand.
A great place to gather with friends for a steam.
A large and comfortable steam room, there is a billiard, an outdoor swimming pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
Workshop at its best!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 men's and 1 women's).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is top-notch.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been attending for 5 months and he really enjoys it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and heartfelt atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, I order through the internet myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
Good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often visit - everything is satisfactory!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "little frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalyevna is very liked by the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hair dryers!
I love the bakery's cupcakes, service, croissants, breakfasts, and the coffee is always top-notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register did not make the coffee until I reminded them, they made it, it's impossible to drink, it smells and leaves an aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all, I am a returning guest here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows this way!
Victoria does an excellent job of adjusting, taking into account all the individual facial proportions.
Correction with warm wax, which effectively removes all fluff, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is chosen according to the type of hair and skin, which helps the dye to last longer.
You can't make better eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very smoothly, quickly, and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating our teeth at Novodent for the whole family for a long time.
Recently, we had our 8-year-old son's teeth treated, everything went just great, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because appointments are made in advance.
In my opinion, the tastiest shawarma in Tambov can only be found here. I'm not a big fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something a bit naughty, I only come here and nowhere else.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of stuffing.
And I don't understand why, but it never leaks for me.
Often when you finish eating a shawarma, you don't eat the bottom because there's a bunch of sauce and water, in short, yuck...., but not here.
So guys, you are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the cafeteria is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various activities are held throughout the academic year.
Pleasant store, polite staff, decent assortment.
However, a major downside is that the goods they bring in are apparently being destroyed right in the sales area.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it's also not very pleasant when goods are placed directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a comment on the organization, not on the specific store.
A stunning example of Soviet architecture.
Strict magnificence, which is carefully maintained.
I got double the pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I distinctly felt that I had come to an Event, that this was indeed a social outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled upon this online auto parts store completely by accident.
Called, provided the VIN code, they said to wait)
They called back in about 10 minutes, offering several options.
Since the car is for personal and work use, I decided not to skimp and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
They called back in another 5 minutes and said that they have good news for you.
If you don't take the whole set of clutch + disc + release bearing, but take the LUK set of clutch + disc and a separate LUK release bearing, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which is pleasing.
Took the clutch and went to the service.
Upon removing the gearbox, it was discovered that a flywheel is also needed, and the sooner, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by call (the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The flywheel was in hand the next day.
The car is pleased with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything arrived quickly, that they were accommodating.
I will definitely recommend and turn to vinkod.shop.
The New Year's party was a great success, but with some nuances.
I reserved a table for two, but they seated me at a table for four.
But no worries.
It's just strange that they didn't warn.
The kitchen gets a four, the fish was a total failure.
A host with contests made on a school-level PowerPoint, honestly, is not very good.
But as for the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was at its peak.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for the event held
I am leaving my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
In this institution, only people who know and love their job work, doctors and nurses are godsend.
In the obstetric department, as well as in the maternity ward, and in the postnatal department.
But I would like to express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Yu., the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., the midwife in the maternity ward. Thank you very much for your help during the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Beautiful store.
A wide range of balloons, always quick order processing and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always arranged with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food was amazing, the programs were non-existent, the waiters were a bit cheeky, but we were in great company with the kids and celebrating an important event, we were friendly.
There was no fiery serving of the dish, the children were waiting.
You can confidently go for good cuisine.
