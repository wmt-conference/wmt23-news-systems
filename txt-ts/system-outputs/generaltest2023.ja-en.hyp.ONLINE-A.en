Rabies cases increase in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Thawichai of the Ninth Office for Disease Control and Prevention said on February 9 that rabies infections have been on the rise in northeastern Thailand in recent months, with a total of 74 cases.

All have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
He urges people to get rabies vaccine with their pets and not to touch the saliva of suspected animals.
Rabies is transmitted not only to dogs, but also to cats and bats.
Almost 100% of people die when infected and develop the disease, but death can be prevented by vaccination before the onset of the disease.

FUJI Experiment with in-house vehicle to prevent accidents left behind|Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information on Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
Fuji (headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, the company is conducting demonstration tests with pick-up and drop-off vehicles at its own facilities.
While tragic accidents occur due to abandonment, we will protect the safety of children.
Currently, a demonstration experiment is being conducted with two pick-up and drop-off vehicles for teracoya THANK, an English after-school for children operated by the company in Chiryu City.
Human motion sensors that detect the movement of people based on the temperature difference between people and the surroundings are installed at three locations on the ceiling of the vehicle.
When the vehicle's engine is turned off and the doors are closed, and a human movement is detected after a certain period of time, a warning notification is automatically sent.
By linking information with the condition of the engine and doors, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the number registered in advance, it is displayed in the chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as missing them.
The demonstration experiment is expected to continue by the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, manager of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out that "during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system became apparent."
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions," he said.
The impetus for the development of the system to prevent leaving behind buses was a series of accidents involving shuttle buses left behind throughout Japan.
An employee with a young child suggested that there was anything he could do to keep them safe.
We decided to develop it to make use of the know-how cultivated through FA (factory automation)-related businesses such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors.
Fuji's anti-leave behind system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed by simply pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a pick-up vehicle, the company aims to lower the hurdle to introduction and popularize it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
【Editorial】The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, originally scheduled for FY2023, has been postponed, and urban development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station is not indicated even now, and urban planning, including surrounding development, is at a standstill.
It is expected to take a long time to formulate a plan, and it is necessary to announce it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 19, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facilities Development Assistance Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station was about 2.5 kilometers radius centered on JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the route were scheduled for the winter of '22.
In Obama City, the opening of Tsuruga and the Shinkansen-related business in anticipation of the Obama opening in the future began in earnest in FY21.
In the initial budget for FY22, the number of projects will be further increased, and the town development will be promoted in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not been shown even now.
The city is considering land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station, and has allocated 3 million yen in this year's budget as a project to formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be executed.
Urban planning centered on the new station "takes time to build consensus among citizens," a city official said.
There is an example of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station in Echizen City, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall concept.
There is concern that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, which will affect the surrounding development.
Prior to the location of the new station, there was a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, citizens' groups in Kyoto City along the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the withdrawal of the extension plan.
In Ishikawa Prefectural political circles, there have been a series of moves to return the settled route to the drawing board, such as calls for the reconsideration of the Maibara route in response to the postponement of the start of construction, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is monolithic.
Obama citizens are relatively calm in their reaction to the postponement of the start of construction, but there are concerns that the location of the new station is unknown and the opening date remains uncertain, which will affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his activities to request the government for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the areas along the line calling for the start of construction as soon as possible will be indispensable.
The indifference that "the Shinkansen will pass someday (west of Tsuruga)" will not move the national government or neighboring prefectures and municipalities.
I want the enthusiasm to keep my voice raised.

A cat-shaped food serving robot introduced at the "Genghis Khanbonta Fukui Station Front Store".
Adorable facial expressions are popular with family customers = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce food serving robots that carry food to the audience.
In addition to being useful for manpower saving in store management and "contactless" customer service to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, the adorable facial expressions of the robots are popular with family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties have voiced that it is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and that food serving robots will become even more widespread.
"Gin, gin, Genghis Khan ♪".
While playing light music, a robot displaying a cat's face on the screen smoothly drove through the restaurant with food on it.
When he arrives at the table in the audience, he says to the customer, "I brought you the food you ordered."
"Genghis Khanbonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When a robot waiting near the kitchen places a dish ordered by a customer and presses the table number on the screen, it autonomously drives to that table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, reacts when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat face on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which operates the store, has introduced food serving robots at two stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito emphasizes that the reason for introducing the system is "labor shortage is the biggest one" and that it is part of improving productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but it has been reduced to 21~22% by introducing the system.
The robot also plays the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient cleanup and "makes families and children happy, and has an advertising effect," he adds.
The Rokuma Hoshiyama Fukui store, a yakiniku and hormone hot pot in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City, also introduced a food serving robot in August '22.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Seongsan Shoten, which runs the company, explains the background to the introduction, saying, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, they don't come easily, so we thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, the zone where employees serve food and the robot delivery range are separated.
The cost of leasing a robot is said to be about the same as the wage of one part-time worker.
In order to save manpower, stores are incorporating an ordering system using tablets in addition to robots, and are considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio by job type in December 22 was 6.94 times for "customer service" such as restaurants, making it a job category with a high sense of labor shortage.
The person in charge of Net System (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the distributor of food serving robots, says, "Due in part to the influence of the Corona disaster, the labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama analyzed, "It will become more difficult to secure employees at suburban stores in rural areas in the future, and I think that food serving robots will become widespread."
【Editorial】The town of Echizen has created an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wish to do so.
When the "Okuyami Handbook" was published the year before last, which covers the procedures necessary for the death of a relative, a written heritage list, a family tree, etc., many people came to receive it for themselves.
Lectures on how to write ending notes and organize before life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that "end of life" has become firmly established among the people of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen Town is 35 pages.
In five chapters, I will start by looking back on my personal history, and describe my current health and financial situation, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a column for what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message for your loved ones.
It would be a lot of work to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill in every page.
What do you most want to write about to your family and the people around you?
The key is to be clear about the purpose.
Bookstores offer a variety of notebooks on the market according to the purpose, and you can easily start writing from the place where you can write.
Likening it to job hunting, the term "end-of-life" was born in 2009.
Two years later, in 11, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly" and that more people are preparing for their own end and end of life.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The new coronavirus that has struck the world has not yet subsided.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused prices to rise, and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, funeral and nursing care expenses that could once be shared between siblings and relatives, and grave management, but now it is not uncommon to have an only child.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the risk of dementia and the need for long-term care increases as we get older.
It should be borne in mind that the background to the establishment of the end of life rather than a temporary end is the growing social unrest.
In any case, we all want to not overburden our partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in ending notes, but don't be too self-righteous.
Instead of secretly writing down hopes and requests, I would like to consult with my family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.

Expressed the idea that it is not necessary in principle for students and faculty members to wear masks at the graduation ceremony = February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided that students should not wear masks at graduation ceremonies.
The principal of a junior high school at a large school said, "It is actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and we are worried about how to deal with it, and some students feel uneasy about taking off their masks."
In response to reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, this topic has been raised among teachers.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal predicted, "If the government decides, it will not be worn, but if it is excluded from chorus, it will be realistically possible."
At this year's graduation ceremony, there are moves to seek to relax the measures at some schools in the prefecture, such as allowing current students who had refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the ceremony is scheduled for prefectural high schools in early March, and for public elementary and junior high schools, the ceremony is scheduled for the middle of the same month.
Prefectural and municipal education committees will wait for official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to determine how to respond.
In addition, there were cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) having decided not to require the wearing of masks in all school education activities from the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children are confused if they suddenly decide not to wear masks from one day, and it is natural for them to decide that they are free to wear masks and then gradually remove them."
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the government's new guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, no masks will be required in choir and physical education classes, and club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, infection control measures will be requested in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and precautions after April will be disseminated to the Board of Education and school sites in the future.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, high schools, universities, etc. will be held during the 22nd academic year, and graduates, faculty members, and participating students will not wear masks after implementing measures such as ventilation.
Yasushi Nagata cutting examinees (left) with scissors who prayed for success = Hair Atelier Rim Rim in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
At the beauty salon Hair Atelier Rim Rim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, every year during the exam season, students are cut using scissors that they prayed for passing.
The examinees said that they had gained confidence and that they were able to face the exam calmly.
Yasushi Nagata, CEO of the salon, has seen and heard students open textbooks while waiting for cuts and express anxiety about taking exams while they are cuts.
So, in 2014, "if it helps even a little," he started cutting prayers for passing.
⇒ Last day of applications for national and public universities
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty salon asks scissors and combs to pray for success.
About 80 people receive cuts every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, employment exams and driving exams are said to be varied.
He gives them a pencil that they prayed for passing.
⇒ Ogi Mama "For you who challenge the high school entrance exam"
A 19-year-old man who was accepted to the University of Tokyo in 21 years recalled, "I was happy to hear their support, and I was inspired to use the golden pencil I received for the entrance exam."
The NPO "Inspirational Literature and Editorial Bureau" self-published a book titled "Dear Prime Minister's 'Bulwark of Life' from Tojinbo"
"Dear Prime Minister, 'Bulwark of Life' from Tojinbo" I have self-published my tenth book under this title.
Newspapers across the country have covered it, and many readers have written about it.
The purpose of this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from suicide attempters about "social and structural" environmental problems regarding the causes of suicide in Japan, and to create a "comfortable society to live in."
For 18 years and 10 months, we patrolled the rocky area at the water's edge in Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is called a famous place for suicide, to prevent suicide, and we have continued our support activities until we find and protect suicide attempts and start again.
This book summarizes the problems we have heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister on the following seven items regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piling up behind suicides.
(3) A person who commits suicide is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with a mental disorder such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty of care for safety" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and is running toward commercialism.
(7) The part of the doctrine of a new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening the other party and making them offer money and goods by telling them of future enshrinements is blackmail.
Religious groups that commit this "fraud and extortion" crime should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, in the comments received from those who have subscribed to this book, we have received comments such as "I was impressed by the strong mentality of the people who are engaged in this activity," "This former police officer is a sign among police officers," and "He is a living bodhisattva who supports such a stranger as well as his own relatives." Here is a part of my impression.
When I saw the photo in the newspaper article, tears welled up in my eyes, "What were you thinking..."
I have heard that suicides among people who have been cornered by the coronavirus pandemic are increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that.
I would like to see a society where people can live their lives happily.
I felt respect and gratitude for all the staff who gave their hearts to those who were in such pain that they wanted to die.
I think this activity is an overuse of both mind and body, but please continue to talk to us in the future.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
I hope that you, the readers, will become gatekeepers of life in the community.

Kenji Shimada, who shoots capybaras almost every week and posts photos on SNS = February 1, indoor facility "Hapijan" at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
There is a man in the city who takes photos of capybaras at the indoor facility "Hapijan" at the Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City in Fukui Prefecture every week and posts them on Instagram.
The post is lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment when the person yawns with teeth peeking out of the big mouth, and the figure lying down and babbling.
It has more than 10,000 followers both in Japan and abroad, helping many people to know the charm of happijan and capybara.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posts traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada, 38, an office worker who lives in the city.
In March 2021, we started posting information on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybaras are one of the world's largest rats, and they swim well with webbed fish between their fingers.
Since its opening in Happijan for 18 years, a total of three animals, one male and two females, have been bred so that they can be observed and fed up close.
Mr. Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of him relaxing in the hot spring, he was shocked, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to their charming expressions and gestures like humans.
After that, I heard that it would be bred in Happijan, and I was looking forward to seeing it up close.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago when I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybaras, and you don't miss the photo opportunities such as the sight of the body shaking and draining the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has reached about 830, and he looks back and says, "I often took this many pictures."
Perhaps he learned Mr. Shimada as he walked by, but the male Yamato approached him and squealed, "Kyurukyuru."
"It's cute and I'm happy," says Shimada, whose love for capybaras continues to deepen.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country, showing each other his best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who also visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I would like to continue to photograph and transmit information mainly at my home, Mt. Asuwa."

The city provides a stipend of 50,000 yen per child to children of high school age or younger from households exempt from inhabitant tax.
The company received data extracted from the computer company it outsourced, but the staff in charge mistakenly thought that high school students were not included and added it to the data, so it was paid twice.
The person in charge of the city's childcare support office said, "We take it seriously and will take all possible measures to prevent recurrence, such as rechecking the data, to restore trust."

It's snow again.
It seems that it is not a cold wave from the north, but the effect of a south-coast cyclone moving eastward through the Japan archipelago.
It has been a short time since we experienced the abnormal cold of 24~26 last month, and we still can't let our guard down▼ Even the same cold will be even more bearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey who were hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
Together with neighboring Syria, more than 20,000 people have been killed, and many are still stranded in the rubble.
It began in 1890 (Meiji 23), when the Ottoman Empire dispatched the warship Ertugrul to Japan.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto Town, Wakayama Prefecture, who was in the sea area at the site, helped and cared for the crew is introduced in movies and novels ▼ About 100 years after this accident, Turkish aircraft was dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War to repay the favor.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
I would like to pay attention to the situation until the situation calms down and reconstruction and recovery.

Bellino Hotel Subsidy Fraudulent Receipt Prefectural and City Accommodation Support Project Full Refund Already|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The prefecture and Ichinoseki City announced on October 10 that the Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, Ichinoseki City) had been inappropriately using the subsidy program to discount the accommodation fee of travelers for about one year from October 2021.
When a person who was not eligible for the discount stayed at the hotel, a discount was applied by lending the name of the employee.
It was also confirmed that many employees used lodging facilities that were not in line with the business purpose of "stimulating tourism demand."
The entire amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotel, has been refunded by the 6th of this month.
The fraudulent receipt of subsidies was the prefecture's "Iwate Travel Support Project," which was implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, and the city's "Ichinoseki Lodging Support Discount," an emergency measure project for tourist accommodation facilities.
The period was from October 18, 21 to October 10, 22 (Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount is September 30, 22), and as a result of the survey, 95 cases of inappropriate use outside the target area or unvaccinated that were not eligible for discounts such as unvaccinated were 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use that were not in line with the purpose and purpose of the project amounted to 6,644,000 yen.
When the prefectural business contractor was proceeding with the settlement procedure, we confirmed several situations where the user of the accommodation discount and the person in charge of reception on the hotel side were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefecture revealed inappropriate use, and the city that received such information also confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already ended, and its registration with the prefectural project was removed on December 2 last year.
In response to an interview, Michiaki Tsuchihashi, CEO of Bellino, which runs the hotel, said, "We apologize for the inconvenience caused to the local community, the prefecture, the city, and many people. This is a hotel thanks to the local community, and we would like to restart from scratch again and work to restore trust."
Takahito Chiba, manager of the promotion division of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, said, "It is truly regrettable, and we would like to once again encourage compliance with the rules and the establishment of compliance, and call for proper use in accordance with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Yoshihito Sato commented, "It is truly regrettable that there was an inappropriate use of the project at accommodation facilities in the city."

We will newly develop dandan noodles (850 yen including tax) made with local ingredients to let more people enjoy the taste of the local area.
Restaurant Kinshuko at the roadside station, which serves Yuda Dam Curry (1,200 yen) and Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen (900 yen), was closed on Thursdays to secure a holiday for its staff, but customers expressed regret.
In response to this, we started operating only ramen on the 9th, which can be handled even by a small number of people.
Of the restaurant's menu, it was decided to sell only four dishes: soy sauce ramen, soy sauce char shu men, miso ramen, and miso char shu men, as well as dandan noodles.
The new product Dandan noodles, which coincide with the opening of "Noodle Shop Nishiki", are based on "Yukikko miso" made from soybeans and sun salt from Nishiwaga, and use green onions, west warabi, minced meat, chili peppers, etc. produced in the town.
We have received many orders since day one, and we will consider offering more than Thursday in the future.
The station was closed from May 2021 to November 2021 due to the closure of Route 107.
During this time, he opened an alternative restaurant "Ramen and Rice Bowl Restaurant Nishiki" in Kotsuzawa, the same town, and utilized the know-how he had accumulated.
Manager Masuoka says, "Dandan noodles that warm your body are perfect for this time of year, and although the menu is small, I want you to feel happy eating delicious food."

Introduction of Pioneers in Plant Research Hayaikemineyama Collection Materials City Cultural Properties Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibition titled "People Who Introduced Flowers of Hayaikemine: A Brief History of Hayaikemine Botanical Research," featuring the ancestors who laid the foundation for plant research on Mt. Hayaikemine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held at the Municipal Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
It collects 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by our predecessors, and introduces the footprints of our ancestors who were involved in plant research on Mt. Hayaikemine.
Botanical research on Mt. Hayaikemine began with Karl Johann Maximovich (1827~91), a Russian botanical researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, and Sukawa Naganosuke (1842~1925), a native of Shiwa Town who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because of foreigners, asked Sugawa to collect them and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sukawa continued to support research after Maximovich's return to Japan, leading to the publication of "Himekozakura," "Nambutouchiso," and "Miyama Yamabuki Shouma," which are endemic to Mt. Hayaikemine.
After that, modern plant taxonomist Tomitaro Makino (1862~1957) published "Nabutranoo", "Kobano clover", and "Nambuinuna thaliana" based on the collected products of local researchers in 1903 (Meiji 36), and "Kato Hakobe" that he discovered and named by climbing Mt. Hayaikemine himself in 05 (Meiji 38).
From the exhibited materials, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
In addition, we introduce Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874~1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied him on the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 27 (Showa 2), and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914~88), who served as a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of "Plants of Hayaikemine".
Sohei Yoshida, a curator at the center, says, "Behind the names of each plant on Mt. Hayaikemine is the accumulation of research and connections between people, and we can trace the connections between researchers that spread from local areas to the whole country."
The exhibition consists of four chapters: Chapter 1 focuses on the beliefs and history of Mt. Hayaikemine, and Chapter 2 focuses on the characteristics of Mt. Hayaikemine from a geological perspective based on research by German ge Japan ologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854~1927), who laid the foundation for geology.

Even when the ball changed, his proud fastball shone through.
Lotte's Aki Sasaki (Ofunato High School) made his first appearance in the seat hitting at Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa on the 9th, throwing 30 pitches and striking 160 kilograms in the World Baseball Classic (WBC).
He had two hits against six batters, and he exuded a sense of fulfillment, saying, "I got a lot of benefits, and my forkball is a little better than it was in last year's training game."
The 160 km was measured twice, jammed Fujiwara and fouled, and Yasuda doubled.
The pitcher calmly put together the pitch with a slider, and Matsukawa was impressed with the good finish, saying, "There was a really strong ball coming and the batter was inserted."
Coach Yoshii also said, "I think things are going well, so far," and seemed satisfied with the steady progress of his fourth year as a professional.
As his next step, he will pitch in a practice match against Yakult (Itoman, Okinawa) on the 15th and throw around 40 pitches.
"I want to be able to show more accuracy and overall cohesion of the straight ball," he said.
Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria damaged by a major earthquake = early morning of the 9th (provided by local residents)
Gaziantep (Southern Turkey) -- Authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria, which were affected by the massive earthquake with its epicenter in southern Turkey, confirmed deaths in both countries exceeded 21,000 on Wednesday.
Rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings in the bitter cold has become increasingly difficult over time.
Intense searches were underway in the affected areas.
The United Nations on Wednesday delivered supplies through the Turkish border to the affected province of Idlib in northwestern Syria for the first time since the earthquake struck on June 6.
Idlib province was the last stronghold of opposition groups opposing the Assad regime in Syria's civil war, and there were fears that international support would not reach it.
Rescue operations continue at disaster sites in both countries, including the use of heavy machinery, but they are struggling.
Many are said to remain buried in the rubble, and the death toll is likely to rise further.
According to Turkish authorities, 17,674 deaths have been confirmed in Turkey.
Combined with the death toll in Syria of more than 3,000, it is more tragic than the 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey that killed more than 17,000 people.
Miyako City plans to take its own support measures to subsidize energy expenses such as electricity, gas, and gasoline for businesses in the city who are struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and prices.
As an emergency measure, we will invest our own financial resources to support the regional economy in a difficult environment.
The target is businesses in all industries (excluding agricultural, forestry, fishermen, electricity, and gas supply companies).
The profit margin for the fiscal year that ended immediately before the fiscal year must be lower than the previous fiscal year.
The maximum amount of the subsidy is 1 million yen per business operator to pay one-half of the increase compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year for expenses for the six consecutive months between April 2022 and March 2023.
About 800 people are expected to receive benefits.

Discussion on renewable energy introduction and targets Amami Airport The 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council|Society and Economics |Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Promotion council discussed for decarbonization of Amami Airport = 9th, Kasari-cho, Amami City
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City), the Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (chairman, Takashi Ando, head of the construction division of the Oshima Branch Office, 13 members), which consists of the prefecture and airlines that use the airport, held its second meeting at the airport on September 9.
All committee members attended, including online.
They exchanged views on setting decarbonization targets and introducing renewable energy mainly from solar power.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46% or more by 30 years (compared to FY13) toward "carbon neutrality" to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year, aiming to formulate a plan ahead of the other six airports on the other remote islands in the prefecture.
The second meeting, like the first one, was closed to the public except for the first meeting.
According to Chairman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the airport's greenhouse gas emissions.
Toward setting targets and introducing renewable energy, they proceeded with discussions in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
According to the handout, the CO2 emissions of the airport's facilities and vehicles in FY13 were 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, emissions of lighting, air conditioning, etc. at seven facilities, including airport terminal buildings, accounted for 1,321 tons, accounting for about 90%, followed by aviation lights at 84 tons and airport vehicles at 71 tons.

The flow of attracting people to the island "Sakasama Real Estate" Okinoerabu branch office opened Landlord recruitment for people who want to rent a house|Society and Economy |Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event that deepened understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" through talk sessions = 8th, Tomina Town
【Okinoerabu General Bureau】The Okinoerabu branch office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate" that visualizes the thoughts of people who want to challenge themselves by renting vacant houses and vacant stores and recruits landlords was held on the 8th at the community space "entaku" in Tomina Town.
Through the talk session, the operating company explained the outline of the service.
Masahiro Okubo, Representative Director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is in charge of the operation of the branch office, said, "By implementing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow that attracts people to the entire island."
Contrary to the normal procedures for real estate, Sakasama Real Estate is a system in which the information of the person who wants to rent is disclosed, the landlord contacts him, and if an agreement is reached, each person signs a contract on their own.
As a demonstration experiment to discover latent vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses, On-Co Co., Ltd. (head office in Mie Prefecture) operated and started the service in June 2020.
This is the seventh branch office to be opened and the first in Kyushu.
This is the first time in Japan on a remote island.
About 20 people participated in the event, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari and Tomina town hall officials, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background to the establishment of the branch office, saying, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island becomes more active, I thought that if vacant houses and vacant stores could be utilized, the town and the island would become more lively from there."
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island or want to do something, and help as many people as possible to promote these efforts," he said.
Takeshi Mizutani, CEO of On-Co, pointed out the points to note in the operation, saying, "It is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what the local people want to do with the area, what kind of people they want to come, and what criteria to choose."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

Do you have a Mercari Mercard?
Mercari doesn't think it's very convenient because it uses the amount of money you sell to make purchases.
I went through the procedure for the first benefit...
I haven't used it yet.
I don't think the listed products will be cheaper yet...
Maybe there is a campaign that you can get a discount if you use the card?
Does the NSR250R flash when the key is turned on and the turn signal is operated with the engine not running?
If the battery is normal, when the key is turned on, the ACC, that is, accessories, is energized, so the turn signal and brake lights are turned on.
You can also play horns.
However, after starting the engine, the voltage rises, so I feel more energetic.
Can DDR4 made by ADATA mix with DDR4 made by Samsung?
Laptop.
In principle, they can be used together as long as the standards such as PIN layout, voltage, and frequency match.
If it is only the difference in frequency, it is also designed to work according to the slower side, but depending on the thing, that area may not work well, so it is absolutely not okay.

Could this be thinning hair?
It is a "split" in the hair due to the hairstyle.
If you continue to do this kind of hairstyle, you are likely to have thinning hair if you comb the comb or brush incorrectly, so be careful.
If you don't comb it wrong, it's hard to get thinning hair.
If you don't like the fact that you can see your skin, changing your hairstyle so that it doesn't crack can solve the problem.

If it was purchased at a famous department store such as Takashimaya, it will have a warranty card, so it can be said that it is definitely genuine, but isn't it? ??

Do you live alone?
Is it any fun?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are accustomed animals, so if you have fun every day, that state will become your daily life.
If fun becomes a daily occurrence, it will not be considered "fun" unless there is more fun.
I understand that, so "everyday life with nothing" is fun.

Have you ever had the flu while you are alive?
Did it take quite a few times?
I myself forgot about the old days, maybe a few times?
I think.
I don't remember getting flu for more than 50 years after I became a member of society, but when I had my antibody level measured in the city 5~6 years ago, I found a sufficient antibody level.
Also, I didn't remember getting vaccinated, but I think I got flu without knowing it and developed antibodies without knowing it.

When I watched the Showa car commercials on YouTube, I thought that they were stirring up purchasing power along with the music, but can you say that the old car commercials were good or good?

No, there were many commercials for celebrities.
There is no doubt that the atmosphere was much more fashionable than it is now.
It was a while ago, but I've been confused for a long time, so please do it.

Once a lymph node swells, does it take days to heal?
I think it depends on the cause of the swelling.
If you have an infectious disease such as a cold, I think you will catch it when the cold is cured to some extent.
If the swelling is too severe and painful, the doctor said that it will not heal unless you take antibiotics, so it may be better to go to the hospital once.

Training in a state of energy depletion (empty belly) reduces muscle
Nutrition (mainly protein) after training helps muscles grow

Isn't it called spring thunder and snow clearing?
It will be over soon
I've been to a few different dentists, but when I sit in that treatment chair, there are doctors and dental hygienists who talk to me from behind me at a slight angle.
I'm not sure if it's better to turn around, but it's hard to look back all the time, and I think it's rude to keep facing the front.
Does anyone understand?
What are you doing?
Not only dentists, but also barbers and perm shops speak while facing the front.
Which material is cooler, Polyester 100 or Dry Rayon?
Dry rayon's are excellent and cool
Tell me
I joined the company in April.

The surface plate of the washbasin door has peeled off, so I would like to request repair, but how many stores should I request?
Please tell us.
There is a decorative board at the home center, so I will repair and replace it myself by processing it according to the size.
When you go to submit your tax return documents to the tax office, you don't have to print them in color, right?
Yes
When will the amount I applied for on my tax return at the beginning of the year be transferred to my account?
I think it will be transferred in about two or three weeks.
You will receive a postcard notification that you will transfer it by postcard, so please register your passbook when it comes, because it has been transferred.
For the time being, we have no choice but to wait for the postcard (notification).

Prepaid cards are not accepted.
It's been a long time, but do you think it's okay?
Vegetable juice.
It also depends on how it is stored.
If you have been refrigerated for a long time ~, you can drink it even after 2 or 3 days, but if you left it outside or left it at room temperature, I think it is better to dispose of it.
If something happens to your body later, it's going to be tough.

Can you enjoy the movie Neverland without knowing the content before and after?
You can enjoy it.
Because it's a simple story.
If you may write it, it is a story about escaping from monsters that feed on humans.

About Instagram.
I (the general public) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if people who don't know this see it, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you think otherwise?
What is it like?
I think it's amazing.
In the common man it is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Troubled and frustrated
I didn't have time to exercise, so I bought it to rely on trendy pressurized innerwear.
Body shape is H175m W80kg I bought L size.
It's pretty hard to wear at first, but once you get used to it, I think you'll be fine.
I used it for a few days, but now I am using another pressurized inner due to a problem.
Problem 1: If the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightness around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) is too tight, and it will be a little congested, itchy.
2. The lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it due to the above two problems.
It's quite tight when it comes to comfort, but you can sleep with it on.
Great value for those who fit
Even at 158 cm and 50 kg, S was fine.
But it didn't suit me because of my large skeleton and muscularity.
Since it is not a three-dimensional structure such as a buttock, it is easy to create strange gaps and fall easily.
I felt like I had to pull it up all the time.
I think it's good if you have a body shape like a stick.
I guess you could say that it is safe and thin in terms of thickness.
It didn't feel like henna henna or tearing, but I was able to boot in with tight-fitting knee-high boots and make it refreshing.
Lovely
As for the upper body, I don't want to show too much skin, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and came across it.
The top is fashionable with a one-point mark on the back of the knitting and hem.
I'm glad to choose whether to wear a bikini or shorts over it underneath, or in two ways (^.
^) I just received it, and I tried it on and it didn't go into the water, so I don't know how durable it is or what it feels like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought that this price was a bargain.
There was no wire on the bust, but when I touched it, it seemed that there was a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
But it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it follows my bust properly, so I think it looks good when I move.
Has the model been changed from no pats to without?
(^.
^) I'm ♪ looking forward to getting into the water from now onThank you very much ♪
45kg 156cm M size and a little bigger.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
It had two rain visors to prevent my face from getting wet.
The strength was not a problem, and I was able to use it with confidence even on a bicycle in a storm.
It was never torn after use.
I carry it in a compact state in a compression bag.
Really, it was a product that exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
Installed on the CLA 180 Shooting Brake for the 2016 model year.
THE INSTALLATION METHOD CAN BE DONE EVEN BY AN AMATEUR BY READING YOU TUBE OR THE INSTRUCTIONS.
Please note that if you loosen the Torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
After that, when you sandwich the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring and caulk it, if you do it with a tapered type such as needle-nose pliers, the force will not be applied evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo and you will not be able to install it.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day, and it is a very supportive company.
When I tried again, I tried to caulk it with wide pliers as shown in the photo of the instruction manual at once, and it worked.
When I returned the last main unit to the car, it was a little difficult to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installation, DVD, TV, navigation system can be viewed while driving without any problems.
I think it is a very cost-effective product because it costs over 80,000 yen if you order it at Dehler, and over 40,000 yen even at a specialty store.
Below the price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it is cut in the cushion and there are fluffy parts and sloppy parts. It seems that it has already been worn out. Or rather, there are few wasps overall, and I thought after using it for a try, but I think that a product in which the head and the pillow part are integrated may or may not fit unless you try it. I thought that there would be no mistakes if the pillow and the body pillow were separated. This time I bought it for 3600 yen in the time sale, but I want to return it. In the first place, I reflected that a review with 5 stars should be more vigilant.
Impossible or impossible
Product arrives.
I used it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, and you can milk properly.
However, there are times when the sound is a little annoying and the power button does not respond well.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but those who care may end up being worried.
It's not super quiet, so 😅 if you use it all night, you may be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part that connects the attached tube and the machine would go into the tube, but I entered 😂 it in the form of pushing it in. I think it's easy to carry because it's lightweight!
It takes a knack to whip...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't foam at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I've used so far has been foaming without any problems even when I use it normally) So, here is the solution I found ↓ (1) First, pick up less shampoo than usual and let it blend into your entire hair.
(At this point, it does not foam at a level where not a single bubble appears) (2) Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo and let it blend into your hair.
(This will finally lather normally) Well, in short, it's a double wash lol The capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo the first time as much as possible ... I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It's obvious that I bought such an expensive shampoo, but I definitely felt that my hair felt better to the touch.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall comment.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was only indebted to face washing goods ...
Even though the capacity is small, the cost performance is poor that forces you to wash twice.
Moreover, in consideration of the scent that seems to be unpopular with everyone, we will give it two stars a little strictly.
Difficult to evaluate
There are negatives and it is difficult to evaluate.
The front side of the blade will be cleaned with a blade cleaner.
I think it matches well with a razor with good blade accuracy.
Positive: As intended, dirt on the blade such as sebum and soap scum can be removed.
If the dirt (only on the front side) makes it less sharp, it will last a long time.
Negative: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coatings, ceramic coatings, and other coatings coated on the cutting edge are easy to peel off.
(If you use shaving about 2~3 times, most of the coating will peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.)
Be careful of razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge.
I wonder if it is cost performance because it can be substituted with fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that can be put under furniture used in preparation for earthquakes.
* The life of the razor is increased by 20~30% that I use.
It is difficult to determine when the razor blade is discarded, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the blade tip becomes rickety.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness from being reduced by dirt.
(It is only a cleaner and has no sharpening effect.) Sometimes it feels sharpened, but it seems to be because a little rust has been removed. ）
Caught up in TV commercials...
I bought it after seeing that the face of a fairly elderly woman was drawn up just by applying it once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a normal gel, and I wiped it off with pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it is sticky and disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging, it will unexpectedly enter your skin.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and it felt like my skin was sucking into my hands.
The lift-up was still not like TV.
I felt the firmness at once.
Since I have super dry skin, this one is still not enough, and I have been using a certain moisture surge 72 before this.
It feels just moisturizing.
I was expecting that the looseness of the pores would also be covered, but it is not.
I think that using one bottle will be effective, and if there is, there may be lipi.
It must have been hard to put it together, but...
It is a compilation of statements by politicians over the past few years.
As I read it, I am somehow convinced that that remark at that time was ahh after all.
However, considering its value as a reading material, it is delicate whether the "fact checking" that the authors call is sufficient enough.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major flaw of this book was the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "fact" here is forever a fact.
I felt that it was quite suspicious whether they were aware of the fragility of "fact-checking" (let's call it falsifiability) from the way they wrote it.
When it comes to this level of awareness of "facts" among reporters in Japan today, I feel a little gloomy.
It seems that many people recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the content of this book.
If there are readers like the reviewer who are interested in the "fact-checking" that the current Japan mass media does, I think this book is not for you.
For those who do not improve their score in mock exams.
At my school, political economy was printed out, and the class format was really boring as if I was studying while being forced to do it, and before I knew it, I hated political economy.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently in high 3 centers this year.
I chose this as my study partner for one hour to and from school after I bought it in March.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You've reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and took the past questions, I was 70, with 40 being the average at that time.
I was surprised even by myself.
It stretches so much that I ate something weird.
I was able to feel that what I could get from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about political economy, but also the ability I had and the improvement of motivation for studying.
Thank you for letting me meet you.
prevention of crime
Eight years ago, I experienced two door-picking attempts and have taken crime prevention measures.
This time, I am replacing the camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, we used infrared irradiation 30m type (other companies).
This product was written by another person, but the distance that can be recognized at night is about 5m.
I agree.
It has just arrived and has not been set, but it is at the stage of comparing the appearance of the camera and checking for problems.
The image quality is much better than the camera of 8 years ago (naturally).
I displayed 4 parts on a 32-inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem.
At the moment, there is no problem with the product.
If you are considering a level that allows face recognition other than crime prevention, you may be particularly dissatisfied with night shooting, but at this price, it is the best!
I use it for crime prevention, but I don't even require facial recognition.
Because if you're wearing a mask or a mask, you won't know (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems that it can distinguish between a high-performance camera and recording.
On the other hand, if you're not a professional, you're in trouble.
However, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so we recommend not relying only on cameras, but also using them together with various crime prevention goods.
For example, there are white solar LED garden lights that can be obtained at home centers for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright, with 6 units).
Since it is solar, there is no need for electricity, but in winter, it does not turn on until the morning, so there are also three 100V human LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters to recognize human figures.
Also, if you think that the intimidation effect will be diminished because the camera is small for crime prevention during the day, I think you need a cover.
I have a sticker that says "24 hours security camera working".
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturers' products than sticking those sold at home centers.
The place to put it is a thief's entry route that cannot be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time ~.
At the same time, it is difficult to understand the instructions for setting the net, so I set it as a minus.
If there are any deficiencies after setup and setting, they will be added.
Empathy so much that it becomes painful to read
If she was born in '82 Japan, her social situation may be a little better than her, but the enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law still makes her far from equal.
As I read on, the painful memories of surviving discrimination as a member of society came back to me, and it became suffocating.
It depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings rather than as women, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal society.
At the very least, it is time for women alone to stop emotional confrontation and stand shoulder to shoulder in this society.
A drama that makes you think "men are the worst"
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
Naturally, even as an adult, he continues to drag on the wounds.
Every guy who comes out is the worst.
The husband of the protagonist, who seems to be mild-mannered and family-oriented, is also the worst in a sense.
There are spoilers ↓ Even if you know that the protagonist's sister is being DVed by her husband, she ignores it, and the sister-in-law finally got the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the protagonist's husband, who is a police officer, passes through, and the development is irritating to men.
The protagonist's old mother, who pretends to be a blur, knows that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it (officially, the death of the biological father is a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that after the death of the rape father, the daughter was not allowed to receive counseling, so it is natural that the main character will go crazy.
Why does the protagonist's daughter want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about Ojii who died so much at this young age?
In the drama? Too much.
A few years ago, in the summer when a heat wave hit France, many elderly people died, and even if hospitals and facilities contacted their daughters and sons, many French people said that they could not take them in because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the morgues in Paris were full.
These people are "dry".
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they were "dry".
French music is completely different from the United States, and there are many unclear parts that give a good aftertaste, but there are relatively many scenes that I thought should be cut, and I watched them while fast-forwarding.
Professional boundaries
If the meticulous calculations and the unexpected accident that could not be read were related to someone's life, even if they had calculated it from the beginning to some extent, they would have decided that it was worth the risk.
The script was brilliant in that embodied such a subtle emotional turbulence drama, as she struggles with her own conflicts that are not shown in public, and how far she deceives those around her in order to pass her beliefs.
Even if you put it on ... Jessica's performance is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no mistake.
It's a professional job.
Feeling of use Then it broke down
I've used 3 units so far, but this product broke in no time, in a good or bad way.
The reason for choosing this product was the first 2200 mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 3 sessions of 200 degrees 5 minutes.
The second USB port is bad.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I reinserted the battery about 15 times (I used the battery in the charger so that the USB terminal would not break), the contact became worse or the power became difficult to turn on.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an ICOS user, you may have experience.
It's that symptom.
As stated in the cautionary note, batteries other than those attached are not used.
The claws and catch parts are like carved out, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought a Starry logo at the same time as the return, but here is a comparison with this.
Appearance size, the same.
It's the same with chambers and draws.
LCD This one is prettier.
Maybe newer than without the logo.
Vibe This is modest.
It's like a smartphone vibrator.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator is loud.
A cheesy Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese, but ...
The accessories are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without logo, lumps like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks quickly, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
It's just ear bands, but ear bands
This flat rubber really does not hurt.
In terms of earfeel, it is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far.
Even flat rubber can twist and rub the twisted heli part against the base of the ear, which is more painful than round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just less likely to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only does it fit, but there is also a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel stuffy.
It may be because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it will suit everyone in the same way, but if you think that any of the other smaller sizes are not good, I think you should try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in a vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear bands on both sides got caught and it was difficult to take it out, so I reduced it by one star.
The response of the contractor is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the response of the vendor who ignored and sent it despite specifying the date.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
Since I always buy on Amazon, I know the delivery person.
In particular, in order to carry heavy objects to the top, I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible, but it was ruined.
It is said that shipping companies are having a hard time because of Amazon, but we are doing it in the hope that there is one thing that users can do to help.
I am disappointed in the response of the arrogant vendor.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, include disposal costs
There are many complaints and I don't think it can be used for a long time.
I think it is a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, it seems that some municipalities have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or inexpensively if you bring it in.
[Comfort] The seat tilts slightly to the left and wobbles even more, so sitting is very tiring.
If you move even a little, you will make a loud noise.
At night it is too noisy to use.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel that I cannot continue to use it with this.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only rough pictures.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
・ There is no explanation about the orientation of the seat and the post fixing platform when installing it Some people say that it leans forward in the review, but there is a possibility that the orientation when installing the seat and the post fixing base is reversed.
When installed correctly, the lever for height adjustment is facing backwards on the right hand side, and the dial that adjusts the spring on the back is forward.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural to face forward, many people will install it incorrectly.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and it is necessary to assemble while trying and making errors while looking at rough pictures.
・ There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who cannot find the 8x20mm screws that come with 12 pieces and look for them.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for it in vain.
The machining accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted and combinations that cannot be inserted even with the same screw hole and screw.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws inserted like this.
Also, the spare screw in the instructions was missing.
[Other] The black part of the surface of vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is whitish in some places, so it is better not to expect something beautiful like the product photo.
An explanation of the defects in the instruction manual and supplementary explanations of the above installation method were sent to the email address registered on Amazon 2~3 days after the product arrived.
Essentially, these items should be issued immediately after the product is shipped.
It is a completely meaningless act because many buyers have completed assembly in 2~3 days after the product arrives.
Well let's see
I'm a big fan of Thermos and have been using the Thermos straw type for over 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use.
(1) The drinking spout part of the straw has become a harder material than before, and the groove is clicked into the main body, and the drinking spout part of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body!
！ I tried desperately to take it and cracked my nails.
(2) Only the tip of the spout of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer enter.
(3) The mysterious part called the valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically difficult to wash.
I'm a little shocked because I haven't had any complaints about using the straw type so far.
It is really stressful to not be able to take the drink mouth from the main body.
The good thing is that it still has outstanding cooling power.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and washed it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink Hot, so I'll continue to be a straw type.
Thank you for improving it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is an impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time) The product arrived as shown in the photo.
When I put it on the Obitsu doll, it is very cute and the light is very satisfying.
However, it cannot be installed unless it is a little hard when wearing (entrance) and presses in with force.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping Since it was my first time shipping from overseas, I was planning to take about three weeks, but it arrived in 8 days (Narita Airport is close) earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it says that it is still shipping.
There was no damage and air in the eyes, and there was a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it is safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is a mail mail from overseas?
I felt doubtful, so I will make it minus 1.
I think the product is a great bargain for this amount at that price without any problems.
P.S. Dolleye 8mm model iPhonese
A little small (small working area), severely charged
I ordered it after seeing the size notation, but it felt about two times smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than A4 size, but since the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was going to use it when repairing electronic devices and making Gundam models, but it is difficult to use without the B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work, and use a separate tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to get by.
Within a magazine-sized area, place tools, place parts, and do more work ... It's impossible.
I thought about ordering another one of the same thing and doubling the area, but the electricity was so severe during the work that all the dust and cut parts were sucked up, so I think it's difficult to continue using it for a while.
Fatally defective products
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened the lid using a rubber non-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it would not close.
At this point it's out.
Highly rated!
Does the battery box lid close???
In addition, instead of the protective seal of the product, there was a small saran wrap on it.
Could this be a second-hand item???
The only explanation is in English, which is written densely on a small piece of paper.
There are no illustrations and no one knows how to operate it.
It might be good if it were another finger ...
Found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use a lot, it won't fit perfectly, and it's a little lumpy ... Was.
But I think it's good for use on other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
Good for the price
After all, you should not expect quality from this kind of product.
One flower mark was crushed.
The size is just right.
Although people with thick earlobes may be harsh.
Maybe I should have bought one without a pattern.
Yabana
The design is good, but it is large when you put it on your hand I wonder if the effect will not fade even if you put it on your foot?
Eastern Hokkaido in the midst of winter...
As mentioned in other people's reviews, the heating wire is only 110×80 net, and the arrangement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, so it was more expensive than the rug type, but it was better because it was larger, but I can't help it because I can't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and 〇tori's N-warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's well done, but
It is small and has sufficient air volume.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on a desk and adjust the angle, it looks good as shown in the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you lay down a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use the sound outside / at a family restaurant, you won't notice it even if it's "inside", but if it's an office, it's not noisy even if it's "small".
It is necessary to have a discount that is only a companion when you go out.
Also, in office use, even if it is "small", the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for scenes where you sweat a lot on the go, run to a family restaurant, and cool down at once with "big".
The only thing is that when you throw it in your bag, the power button is rarely pressed and left spinning without your knowledge.
It would be nice to have a way to slightly retract (cave in) the button, or to press and hold the weak first press.
It is an essential item in the era of extreme heat when life is in danger, so it would be helpful if you could make better things.
Multifunctional Light Speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in the bedroom.
Better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As for the light, you can adjust the luminous intensity and color by touch.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with a gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch one touch at your favorite color, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think it is more than satisfactory enough for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional.
・A large speaker is attached to the top.
Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones allows you to enjoy music wirelessly.
・ If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・ In addition, since it supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a PC and can play music as an mp3 player.
Typing and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started taking on the challenge of DTM to prevent blurring.
Purchased an audio interface and instrument.
At first, I was driving, but I became addicted to playing the piano and practiced every day.
I downloaded the appendix sound source, but the protection did not work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel deceived by the appearance.
Is the product out of place?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the Doushisha office chair (flip-up armrest) that I used for 4 ~ 5 years deteriorated and became tattered, so I considered purchasing a non-synthetic leather flip-up armrest chair.
I searched home improvement stores and furniture stores, but there are no suitable items.
I was worried that I could not confirm the actual product, but I compromised the appearance and price of the design and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
【Note】The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I couldn't see the oil adhering to the hexagonal wrench and the main body was white, so I was in a hurry when the oil got on it.
Assembly is completed in 40 minutes.
Completed and confirmed product.
The hardness of the lifting and lowering of the flip-up type armrest is different on the left and right, the left side is heavy and the right side is light for raising and lowering, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force and hangs immediately with a "click" sound.
The seat feels hard with non-recycled high-density urethane foam and is not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?).
The competition mesh of the back part is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear light clothes, your back hurts.
It's a small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (the height of the seat height is important for height) Also, the leg part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so the durability remains questionable.
I lay a cushion that I bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is likely to deteriorate (damage) quickly, so I use it with a towel ket.
At 186 cm 80 kg, I felt that only the fit of the back was good, but other than that, I think it is a product with low satisfaction, and I feel that it is a product that is out of the ordinary.
After all, it may be better to sit down and purchase an office chair after seeing the actual product.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying hello, so should I inquire about the armrests and headrests?
Under consideration.
Well, I wonder if it is something like this.
In my environment, it seems that I can see BS4K turning right, so I bought a Pixera 4K tuner that was cheap without expecting much.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free right-handed broadcasts such as NHK BS4K, and I was able to watch it beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV that I purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is stuttery) The update came immediately after purchase, and it became compatible with recording, so I made some scheduled recordings and watched it, but I wonder if there is also the influence of the external 2.5-inch HDD, only the image stops in playback, and frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is not a compliment, but rather a "4K broadcast can be watched".
By the way, during scheduled recording, it feels like you can only follow and play back the recorded program, and I accept this as a plus function that you can record in 4K to the HDD.
If you buy with various expectations, you may be disappointed, so do not expect too much.
I hope it will be improved in the update.
Keep warm function is OK
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500ml PET bottles in it, it became warm in about 2 hours and felt hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan noise is worrisome when idling stops, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell of chemical that was emitted by the fan because it was still new, so I needed to open the windows regularly to ventilate the room.
As another person wrote in the review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder string passes are terrible, so you need to break the burrs with a flat screwdriver.
Really fragile
Today, it suddenly broke after 2 months of using it.
I liked the keystroke feel and size, but it doesn't make sense if it's broken.
I use my PC all day to process video, but the volume becomes 100% on its own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use the earphones because my ears hurt, and I feel like using the PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears and turns off on the computer screen repeatedly.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with mouse instructions, so you cannot use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard each time.
The enter key and backspace key also stopped responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's for 1,000 yen, you may want to try it.
If you're lucky, you can use it for about half a year.
This is a 6-month warranty compared to other companies' 1~3 year warranty in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks of its fragility.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst
I love the products because they are different colors.
I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for food stockers! !!
However, there was a gap that rolled around in a large cardboard, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
I recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for the time being
When I bought a new lid, I bought it because I couldn't help but feel unsupported.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound such as "Mekimeki, (about to break)".
You have to choose one that fits the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when purchasing.
Paw ball cute back
When I had a dog and was looking for a bag to go out, I was attracted to the stylish gray bag and bought this.
It was assembled and surprisingly light when I held it, so it didn't feel so heavy even if I held it.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a snag.
It seems easy to travel for a long time.
It becomes very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the paw ball, and it is cute even if you put it on.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with the appearance and the low price! I bought it.
TSA Rock is my favorite for a few years here, and I have a few others, but it's convenient.
And as a master of forgetting or losing keys, number locks are recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's good, but if you want durability and security, the zipper part is a week, and since it's a cloth, I can use a knife! If it is cut, it will break in an instant.
Also, the fasteners are sweet to match, so I would like to see a way to overlap.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to carry it on board.
For the time being, I used it on a bullet train trip and it was comfortable.
It is difficult to choose the size ...
Because of the width, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and buns wear 24 cm.
The MRL996 is also 24 cm.
Is it hard at first? I thought, but once I got used to it, I was fine.
This ML574 was certainly tough when my sister said that 24.5 cm was tough and I was allowed to wear it.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
That's why I bought 25cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was big ...
When I put it on, it was a little loose even if I wore socks.
I was worried about returning it, but it would be troublesome if it became hard at 24.5, so I will wear it with an insole at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red and it is very good in bright red!
There are many monotone black and white clothes, so wearing this will make it brighter!
165cm, Male in his 40s
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if the specifications below are similar, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm It is a typical metabolic belly.
< feast> In the water, the rash guard turns up, probably because the waist area is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the part that has turned up.
Especially if you are careless in the jacuzzi, your metabolic syndrome belly is in full view.
Also, if you walk while vigorously moving up and down, you will still turn up from below.
The fabric is durable and not too thin>, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.<
At this price, you can be satisfied with this make, but I think it will be better to buy a smaller one.
After all, there was a gas leak, but...
The Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, and there was a problem that part of the tank was missing when the valve was replaced, but when I used [Bath Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair grease up, I was able to hit it well, and if you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble and assemble it, or someone who can. I don't have to disassemble it while taking a digital camera photo, so I can't recommend it to those who are not confident, but if you think it's okay to break, it may be fun I bought another black Colt 25, the trick to disassemble it is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, and I managed to disassemble it without the parts flying, When assembling, I applied silicon grease to the springs and fine parts and assembled while fixing them with grease, and when disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the safety and remove the two screws on the left side of the body, remove the tip of the barrel so as not to scratch it, and pinch the front sight and the inner barrel with pliers so that it comes out. Then you can slowly remove the left side of the Monaca structure and disassemble it, but don't blame others if you fail at your own risk.
I wondered what kind of quality 188 yen was.
You can use it when you need fast turning and torque.
It's light, small, and above all, simple without embellishment.
There was no rattling when the bit was attached, and I thought that if it was 188 yen, it would be a surprising cost performance.
The other thing is durability.
You may not use it very often, but I think it's good to put it in your toolbox.
I bought it with the same vendor's "1/4 Inch Hex Shank Magnetic Quick Release Driver Knurled Bit Holder 60/100/150mm".
There was no problem here, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
Controller stuck
The aircraft moves without permission and becomes inoperable.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine moves in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
This product is better not to buy.
I would like to warn you for the time being.
It's a terrible product.
ALTHOUGH IT IS WIRED, I RECOMMEND THE BEBONCOOL PS3 CONTROLLER.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even after a long use.
It can also be used for PC games.
・ P.S. I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate by returning it as a defective product within one month, so I think that was good.
Will this increase the computing power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible unless you are a child who understands calculations to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give tools to the master, I slide the screen up with my finger, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I do it, it doesn't go smoothly.
In short, it may be easier for those who are used to DS to slip it.
I don't like the illustrations of cartoon characters, or rather, I think that DS and the like are entered because of the fun of the screen... For some reason, I can't get familiar with them.
The method of calculation is also a way of competing for time, for example, how many questions are answered correctly in how many minutes.
I understand the feeling of rushing with exams and so on, but ... Won't you be in a hurry to calculate?
I don't like the gong when it's over, for some reason.
Isn't it okay to make it sound more pleasant even though you're working hard?
I feel like 6,200 yen has lost some money.
I understand if it's half the price.
I'm sorry, I ended up with ☆ 2 pieces like this.
After all, Persona's songs are good!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played halfway through.
Persona 4 has already been troconned on VITA.
What I can do hasn't changed since the previous Persona 4.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous one.
The songs are cool after all!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... With that in mind, I feel that 3 is a better deal.
As a sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with a background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
If you are a master of sound games, turning on the challenge function may make it a chewy game.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
It's kind of a shame
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual one is bluish but close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but for now it's on hold. Will I give up because the price is low?
P.S. After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging it for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good despite the inexpensive product.
4 stars to support P.S. After that, I also bought gold.
I think the color is very beautiful almost as in the photo.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
Only there is a pity.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used it for the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setup, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (> settings> turn on data roaming from the mobile communication  communication options) and it worked.
It seems that the instructions attached to the product did not have much to do with ...?
However, the signal around Gimpo Airport was bad, so I was holding on to 3G for a long time.
Once in the city, it became 4G.
In the evenings and at night, the communication sometimes became very slow, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the limit of up to hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought
I used the SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free and used it with Ymobile, and the Z4 was getting sick, so I was looking for a used Xperia, and I found this phone that was new and could use a saifu phone.
Since I was using mobile Suica, I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so at a glance is the iPhone 6? That's my impression.
Since I don't play GAME, the processing speed is the same as Z4, and I have the impression that it's a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes a little time to recognize So face recognition is faster, so I'm using it here.
I thought it was amazing like an iPhone Android was also Ver9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I was interested in A little smaller There is no strap hole * Compatible with a case with a strap hole I haven't tested water resistance A little heavy I've only used a little yet, but I'm satisfied I recommend it
