Diego Cocca is Mexico's new national coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup with the United States and Canada for the first time with 48 teams. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago.
Geesthacht: New seed-planting signs to encourage planting
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the working environment.
The 'Geesthacht opbloesem' campaign also includes information on what is currently blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015.
To ensure that the project is not just an action of nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also reaches out to the private gardens, explanatory boards are being placed to the plants. About 50 signs have been put up so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will repot at home.
The first week of January saw the start of the wild hazel season.
More recent shrubs such as winter scented heath cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the earth of the buckets on Bergedorer Street for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been thought of with further signs. "The winter scented heath cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide", is there to read among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers, but in the first week of January the season has already started for the wild hazel.
Ernestine, 102: "I am young because of the steppes"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would be proud of her when he looks down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday at 3 p.m. at the Mandolin Motion Show Academy, three ladies meet for a tap dance - together they are 277 years old, excuse me, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich-born (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh" Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing are my life, I can't imagine life without them".
Ernestine is joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) in the dance.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, acting and singing".
Elfriede Widmann, 79, is the chick in the tap-dancing circle, and she says: "We're just having fun with our dance teacher, Sissy Engl".
Tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known worldwide. With two metal plates, each more durable than the wooden soles originally used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced during the dance that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussionist. The English term for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-heard sound while dancing.
Sissi Engl, 77, is the soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we welcome big and small, old and young".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "I keep myself young by exercising", the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone is: "Exercise, eat healthy and don't drink".
Analogue in dialogue - the limits of the digital
As digitalisation progresses, some people are turning to analogue technology
The speed with which our daily lives have become digital has left us with little time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden: In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, you had three options: either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line, or you were one of those who had someone from that exclusive group in the neighborhood who could call their relatives for a bottle of Radeberger, or you went to a pay phone, not to mention the smell of the plastic earpiece and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to call and see the other person's face - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What to do in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economist has 14 days to do so.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had resigned unexpectedly, the pro-European head of government under massive pressure, as she herself announced as the reason for her resignation - apparently because she was opposed by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova, Ukraine's neighbor, is suffering economically from the war, with inflation running at over 40 percent and the tiny republic hosting tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau Parliament, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, holding 63 of 101 seats, so the confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians have gained popularity with Kremlin support.
Those were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 is the year of the big celebration in Veitshöchheim, the fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities are not far behind.
Markus Söder, the father of the state, did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
The Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is going to space.
The president of the Landtag, Ilse Aigner, chose no less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode, Bavarian Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy, Finance Minister Albert Füracker, with his wife Evelyne, who wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in Fasching: Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid at his side.
On the waltz: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to the craft with his costume, and his partner Tanja Schweiger, a councillor of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition was not to be missed, of course.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD leader Florian von Brunn is in the mood for a walk with the SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal was chosen by FDP leader Martin Hagen, who came as Harry and Meghan with his wife Anisha.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and on the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 respectively.
If politics doesn't work out, he can still do magic.
The Commission is also proposing to make the EU's digital policy more transparent.
Back in the 1920s, the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, the BR director Katja Wildermuth and the BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side kick against the climate activists by the Frankish crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed either, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: A bold eighth in the World Cup sprint
The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and closes in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is a TV expert on site, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partially strong fog did not prevent the perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the race platform. On Wednesday, it was enough to successfully defend the title with Norway's mixed relay.
There is little doubt that the chase will be followed by the third man, and once again, Bo is the clear favorite in the chase, with his running form being so outstanding that he can compensate for shooting errors with a degree of startling ease.
After the routine had given up all chances for a medal with a penalty round in the mixed relay and it had only been sixth, it did not go better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in the lying down shooting and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen he won surprisingly six years ago with a 0.7 second lead over Bo. It was one of only three career successes Dolls has stood on the podium so far this winter. The Beijing Olympic eight pulled after his weak performance without saying a word and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will focus on the value of democracy, with both looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has been pushing for the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test", Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength". Lula countered, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolating itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a by-election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is eerily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden, who he said did not care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening", Lula said. "It looks familiar to me", Biden replied, an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note to the press - Friday
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accept them.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society.
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which usually follows Raudis in the subway or onanists in the park, is releasing a new edition with the friends of the "war criminal" Putin. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's that Mrs Wagenknecht is in first through fifth place, followed by Mrs Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this paper anymore, and if they do, it's about time, because we've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below that.
And at the latest now, in a good dialectic, Mrs Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, that is to say, of peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people.
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the Bild newspaper and RTL in the same words. He said: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the competent court via his family lawyer to annul his life partnership. I do not comment on details".
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there were rumors of separation for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports.
The last survivor of the Oradour-sur-Glane SS massacre has died
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remained intact, a memorial centre was established in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had worked for, among other things, Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve for 14 houses: in homeies everyone knows everyone
LZ-series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien often live three, four generations under one roof. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles roar a day along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also return right away.
German central bank chief Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary to combat high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening of China could also temporarily boost prices", Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and forecast a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March.
Higher interest rates raise the cost of borrowing, which can dampen demand and thus counteract high inflation rates, while higher borrowing rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
"The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher cost of financing for some countries", said Sewing. "Of course we have to keep an eye on this, but high debt levels must not deter the ECB from taking a firm stance".
The ECB's objective for the euro area is price stability at a rate of 2% over the medium term.This target has been far from being reached for months.While the upward pressure on prices eased again in January, consumer prices in the euro area of the 20 countries were still 8.5% above the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, who can afford less for one euro.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later", warned Sewing, who is also president of the German Bankers' Association (BdB). "That is what I see as the biggest danger to the German economy at the moment, but I am optimistic that we can avoid that scenario".
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "German pace" of infrastructure projects called for by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And it will perhaps be a bit more controversial", he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany-Tempo".
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters, but that should not automatically mean that we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in the neighbor's garden against his will", said Hartung.
In the past, the classic set of rules has been tried and failed. "We should think again whether the previous approach was correct. Perhaps we have overdo it with the set of rules and made it too complicated".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of energy from renewable sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, solar panels, solar water heating, solar water heating, and solar thermal systems.
Union warns of Bayer's demolition
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a possible break-up of the group after an announced change of management at Bayer. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three legs is exactly the right position for the challenges of the future", said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's executive board and Bayer's supervisory board, to the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
The report also highlights the need to improve the quality of life of the people who work in the pharmaceutical sector, the consumer health sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the consumer health sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the non-prescription sector and the agricultural sector.
The background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial head Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmacy of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been criticized. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkuseners had brought expensive litigation about alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate into the house. The Bayer stock was in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking to extend his contract, which was originally scheduled to run until 2024.
The very small fund, with an unknown amount of stake in Bayer, is known for its aggressive approach. e divestment of "the Consumer Health business would be a possible way to increase the value of the company", Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post.
Hundreds of thousands to protest pension reform
The Paris
The French are planning to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are protesting against the government's plans to take to the streets, with hundreds of thousands of people planning to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate again on Saturday against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people participated in protests. A turbulent debate in parliament has been going on for a week over the controversial reform.
Already many people in France are working longer than they would have to until the age of 62 if they had not paid in enough for a deduction-free pension when they reached the age limit.
Macron: Pension fund is in danger of running out
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
The government is not only seeking to reduce the retirement age, but also to speed up the increase in the minimum period of contributions for a full pension, which was decided on years ago, to abolish individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups, and to raise the minimum pension to about EUR 1200.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. A first attempt to implement the reform was canceled during the Corona pandemic, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying success - widespread protests and strikes were certain.
With Macron's camp no longer in absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of conservative Republicans who have announced support. But some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron is currently worried about crippling strikes. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility so that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - sunny high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area over central Europe determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
The Offenbach
"Looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches the eye directly over Central Europe", explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will still determine the weather in Germany".
But calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "In fact, such a high can be quite nasty, leaving people in the lowlands with a gloomy, misty sky for days on end, while the high mountains are in the sunshine".
The weather is expected to be cloudy and foggy in most regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it may rain a little. Especially on the Alpine edge, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, again nibbles at the high mist and can dissolve it more and more as the day goes on", says the meteorologist. On the Alps, in the high plateaus of the Mittelgebirge and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sunshine is expected all day, while elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high mist. The highest values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine they are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, they are expected to be only 3 degrees. In addition, weaker winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may again be only a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather after fog resolution is clear. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun shines all day according to the forecasts. The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator hadert: No more world medal for Goggia
The top favourite, Sofia Goggia, was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
French
"I'm sad because I didn't do the best I could", the Italian told ZDF after she was knocked out by a goal.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
"I thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second", Goggia said after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all the experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".
Missing girl in Berlin: who saw Viktoria?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Victoria Stankovych was last seen Friday at the Waidmannslust station, and police are asking for information on her whereabouts.
Berlin police are asking the public to help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the school premises together with other children in the direction of the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust on 10 February 2023 at around 12.30 pm. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of German language and place.
He is a very thin man.

Selensky and Ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev: With the demand to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
A joint teleconference was held to agree on a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues", said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video conference was held at the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue".
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions", Selensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian aggressive war, in the end, even a neutral flag was drenched in blood and unwearable.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also considers Belarus a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The conference was prompted by the announcement by the IOC that it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions under certain conditions, and Ukraine's threat of a boycott if the IOC admits the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The German Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, then stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would not accept the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the unconditional solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way", a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa.
The German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January that "sports should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
The IOC is currently barring Russia and Belarus from many international sports competitions, but is seeking to allow athletes from both countries to return to the international sports arena under a neutral flag, provided they clearly adhere to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.
Go where it happens
"Hey, hot ass!" whistling at the fool in the tight sexy costume and shouting obscene words: all this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost: US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half its tanks in its aggressive war against Ukraine, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main tank stock" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine", said Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks the U.S. estimates it has seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin head Dmitry Medvedev offered to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad begged for planes, missiles, tanks", Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Parliament is given the opportunity to express its views on the draft resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and to make a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
The army is in turmoil over the appointment of new staff
The post of the former director of the Military History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner was not advertised, but the Academy's personnel representative Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects corruption and abuse of office.
The Minister of the Interior, who is also the Minister of the Interior, has been appointed by the President of the Republic, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Interior, the President of the President, the President of the President, the President, the President, the President of the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the Prime Minister, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President,
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability for the content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision had the "appearance of a postman", says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still stuck up to its neck in the swamp of corruption", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary request on the subject.
Carnival: First Fools to Kneel at the Cost
Thuringia's Carnival Town of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional "fasching" move, unlike the state capital, but the higher costs, including security, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "Joyful People's Parade" in Cottbus, again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Also during the Swabian-Alemannic Fast Night, no parades were canceled.
The carnival society's president, Heiko Claußen, says: "We are going through with our event", but here too financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or if the previous ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be tapped - "this is not possible every year".
And inflation: The price of sweets has sometimes risen by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Nuremberg Fast Night Train Association. Due to luck in misfortune, 2020 was ordered too much, so there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as many personnel are needed as in 2020.
The train is not going to be able to accommodate the large number of people who are travelling on the train. "I think that if it doesn't rain like a hailstorm on that day, we can expect an increased number of people", says Holger Kirsch, the train conductor from Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular train for the past two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the train".
The Cologne Festival Committee did not comment on the cost in detail, but said that the train was generally "deficient", which was no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered to be drinkable for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lemberg. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't notice a big difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a whopping 80 percent in five years. Well, you can hardly see here how you can believe the Russians. As a tourist, you should be careful with it. But that's only if it is sold in the masses there, then it will be fine.

Biathlon World Cup: President sees favourite win and praises the Supreme Court
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by the chandelier-maker Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the Oberhof World Cup sprint, but there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
As much as the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the podium on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone", Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted smilingly, referring to the foggy clouds that kept coming into the stadium, which greatly affected the view of the race track for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the biathlon", he said and also praised Oberhof for its modernised sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions.
The Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again won the competition. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian four-way victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6).
Bo had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visual conditions. However, in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the draw; they landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his brother, who is five years older: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him", said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
"If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one", took sports director Felix Bitterling his "Lokomotive" in duty. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 / ZDF and Eurosport live) a nearly sold-out arena.
Brych dislikes "Swarm of bees" in the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych is deciding on the referee ball.
The German referee wants to "punish consistently" unsportsmanlike conduct.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field of play. "I already think that there are new behaviors of the players, who after decisions surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area", said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it".
The German coach Christian Streich was given a red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The coaching behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behavior has become a bit demanding or aggressive towards referees. We also want to consistently address such unsportsmanship", said Brych.
DFB referee-chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good coexistence of coaches and impartial. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. With this then the affected person has to live. This should not be anything world-moving", said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can lead to conflicts in the course of the game, but if it turns into a personal insult, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee", said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, the parties would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking were to be initiated in general, that such behavior simply is not appropriate", said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always fade. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour", said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and the affected parties, is always helpful".
Oftebro wins the combined event in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal bar and the ten-kilometer long ski run by Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter.
The German combined team will not compete in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the world championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia, with training in Oberstdorf. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels it, of course", said German coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven people injured in a road accident on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the motorway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police statement, the accident occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete blockage of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The exhibition was initiated by the initiators Sebastian Freytag (L) and Georg Elben (R) and the artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, the Marler Sculpture Museum will close with an unusual exhibition, with some extras.
The final talk on the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marler Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the artworks disappear, but a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum.
In addition, Dr Friederike Schuler will give a lecture on wall-painting in the service of the community, using numerous illustrations to present the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the links to this art genre in the Federal Republic, with a focus on NRW in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and in 2013 she received her doctorate in mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching building-based art as well as art and institution history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art on construction in NRW.
Arrest warrants for collapsed buildings in Turkey
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the conclusion of the agreement on the conclusion of the agreement on the association of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community with the European Union.
Istanbul: Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible defect in the construction of buildings in southern Turkey after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people were arrested, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The defendants are allegedly responsible for defect in the construction that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible structural defects in collapsed buildings, Anadolu reported, and has issued 62 arrest warrants so far. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at Istanbul airport, where he tried to travel to Montenegro with cash, and is currently in custody, Anadolu reported.
A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 magnitude earthquake at noon, collapsing more than 7,500 buildings in Turkey alone.
The last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow, has died.
Hans Modrow has died, the Bundestag's left-wing parliamentary group has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night of Saturday. Dietmar Bartsch, the group's chairman, praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95", the Left Party in the Bundestag announced on Saturday.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days.
Left Party leader Dietmar Bartsch described Modrow in a message on the short-message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist".
"He was an important adviser to our party until his old age, "whose wisdom will be lacking".
"The whole peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special merit of him. This will remain his political legacy", wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
'His later activities in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing also that part of the former GDR population which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.'
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state "quite critically". Too quickly the German unity had been accomplished, the GDR had fallen too unconditionally, and too unilaterally it had been condemned as a "lawless state", Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened last night
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks, but Kiev is forced to repair the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks has forced repairs on Ukraine's energy grid, but Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. The situation with the power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to instability in the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor block at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was cut at the Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack on Friday with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terrorism, but in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selensky doesn't want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
On February 24, the war will have been going on for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, an important Ukrainian supporter, just before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alarm was raised late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones", the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German rail: Federal government selects network company consultants
The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should, however, be oriented towards the public good in the future.
The EU's budget is €80 billion.
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to accompany this process. The repair congestion on the railway network is a major reason why the railway is currently very unpunctual. Minister of Transport Wissing has taken it upon himself to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations of the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
The Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse did not come down even when entering. "Such a race", and that at the Home World Cup, "you can not describe it with words", she said. 11,000 spectators shouted to the thundering hit music with Germany flags, supervisors and team fell into their arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", she had decided
The pressure was particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only German medal hopeful outside the relay in the World Championship. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter as the only German. In the overall World Cup, she currently ranks fifth. And even though the performance density among women in the top is much higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, there were others on the sheet for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Nicaraguan bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state, accusing Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been tense since 2018, when protesters demanding Ortega's resignation took refuge in churches.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened by the same thing as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. What investments would be specifically eliminated, however, cannot be said at the moment. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this stage", says a response from the Federal Government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gäensdech (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is the rising interest rate. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans themselves. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the motorway upper Kupferzell left in the direction of Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced.
Both parties to the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system did not result in any complaint. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
The Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
The European Union is not only a political force, but also a political force, and it is a political force, and it is a political force.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is a matter of concern to the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered in Stuttgart's Castle Square to remember and pray for the victims.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the prayer of the Imam seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked for health, protection from pests and for respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed to the following joint declaration on the situation in the Middle East: 'The European Union stands with the people of Turkey and Syria, and we stand with the people of Syria.'
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting donations in the street of the Bell for several days, to be transported by truck to the earthquake-stricken areas.
The following is a list of the most commonly used terms in the German language:
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps ".... The older people know the saying, the younger people simply put it into practice. In one way or another, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unprecedented renaissance. Because thanks to Home Office, those who do not sit in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or instead of a walk to the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 14 hours not only dogs are wandering around.
One reason could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Why not take a short walk through nature to hear news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Also, work and private life could be combined in this way - who says that the meeting with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Unless there are no strangers nearby, of course.
Another thing that can be done well is to buy natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, that is on a table next to cheese on the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid if you have not thought about the purchase in advance and made appropriate arrangements. So an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer's wooden sales room with empty hands and regrets in their voice. "Sorry, we forgot the money".
The disappointment is palpable, since one has a wallet-carrying companion but no carrying case. This is also what one lets the friendly casual acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which one has quickly overturned before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the journey back with a meat-inlay and in that midday excursion you have not only been enriched by a lamb's back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that on that day a second walk will be due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and badly injured
The 25-year-old driver of the Audi was trapped in his car, and the firefighters freed him with a heavy device. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Due to suspicion of driving misconduct, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, Audi suffered a death toll of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax returns: the end of the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided that the Treasury Department must turn over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, when he was still President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department said in a decision Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the United States, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax returns public as a candidate or later as president. He fought against a release until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor in New York has now received the documents, but no details of it were allowed to be made public - unless it came to a trial.
The issue of the release to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: there the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the investigation of the committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law".Access to the Republican's tax records was a matter of national security, she tweeted. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president", Pelosi said.

British high-profile criminal caught in Thailand after long-running escape
London - A convicted British drug offender has been captured in Thailand after five years on the run. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals, the NCA said on Saturday, after he was arrested by Thai police in a Bangkok auto repair shop on Friday.
The leader of a criminal group had fled a trial in early 2018 in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempting to import eight million pounds (nine million euros) worth of amphetamines, according to authorities.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the educated physicist from Unterfranken, who has lived in Vienna for three years and according to his own admission loves the Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits well into the generally prevailing domestic scientific scepticism here is up for debate. His humor fits very well to Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, after all, he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Knowledge Night actually is and what it can do - and what it can not do. Of course, there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What's really important? All of this with a huge wink, unemotional and very ironic, and so you're not only entertained, but you're able to learn something along the way.

General
The single-player BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plain there are rock pyramids and rock squares that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shells.
The player is presented with slow moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. In addition, UFOs still appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO hit.
4. The game
The game progress is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds are audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game begins with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles can be determined by the player by observing the text entered in the upper left corner of his cockpit's display.
The top cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, the opponent in the fire area is displayed in the upper left-hand display.
The UFOs are designed to circumvent the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot through the player's tank will bring 5,000 points to this setting. If an opponent is hit, the following long points will be achieved: 1,000 points for a collapsing tank, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a Super-Panzer. Super-Panzers can be switched and rotated twice as fast as a tank, or give the player the opportunity to unlock multiple bonus positions for the player, such as a long-range missile, or 3, 4 or 5 additional options for the player to unlock multiple tanks.
Initial input at peak results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of high scores, he or she may enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game is over. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that with the triggering of a self-test, the resetting of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or a power outage, the table of high scores is deleted.
New parts
The BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI switch lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, which has made this structure unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another change is the centrifugal rubber handle, which, like a centrifugal spring, always puts the control lever in the central position. The micro-controllers are now lightweight, so they can be replaced with a self-contained motherboard. The new device has been designed with a new energy-saving device called the BATTLEZONE. The XYZ console has been equipped with a screen that is connected to a larger screen, a larger screen, and a new C-Class console. This has been made possible by the addition of a new screen, a larger screen, a smaller screen, and a new screen that is connected to the same screen.
These new components, as well as all the other main components of this apparatus, are shown in Figure 1.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should perform some checking to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be performed: NOTE: The device has not yet been connected to the 220 V network. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage.
NOTE: Never force connections to the connectors. The connectors are provided with a force guide so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twisted connector will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check that the connectors to the game PC board are in place and in a correct position. (3) Check the device's serial number on the model plate on the back of the device. 3) Check that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. A diagram of the location of the serial number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be specified when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check that all other main components such as the network connector, the solar panel and the TV monitor are in place with a type plate on the back of the device.
The following are a series of tips that can help you solve most problems associated with current DirectX games.
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package.The DirectX Diagnostic Program can be used to get an overview of your system if you are not sure that your PC meets the requirements.Please follow these steps to access the DirectX Diagnostic Program: Click the Start button and select the Run option.Enter dxdiag" in the text box.The DirectX Diagnostic Program user interface will now be displayed.Here you will have access to all relevant system details, including graphics and sound card information.You can check that the graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons in the DirectX Diagnostic Program, and then we will continue to test the DirectX Diagnostic Program by clicking on the DirectX Diagnostic Program's Start3 button and not changing the instructions.So, if you are not familiar with the DirectX Diagnostic Program, we will continue to test you via the DirectX Diagnostic Program.
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources needed for the game to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically started when the system starts. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "Background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar.
Before installing software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working at its best. So make it a habit to "clean up" your PC regularly. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Chances are that current games will run on your PC without much of a problem. A "clean" system also has the advantage of being much more efficient, and therefore other applications you use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk and Defragmentation and Data Cleanup tools.
Click the Start button and select the Help option (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Debugging (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup. You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:
How to stop all unnecessary background usage
Important note: After the game ends, you should reactivate the background applications by restarting your PC. This will automatically reactivate all the background applications you have terminated. Windows 98/ME
To exit a background application, click the entry in the taskbar and then click the exit button. Note: Do not exit the background applications Explorer and Systray, as they are required to run Windows. You can safely exit all other background applications. The window will now close and the task is finished. Repeat the above steps to exit all other background applications (up to Explorer and Systray on Windows 2000/XP Professional).
To exit a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then click the End Task button". Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing STRG, ALT, and ENTF may not display the Windows Security window, but instead, immediately displays the Windows Task Manager on Windows XP Home.
To exit a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then click the "Exit Task" button before calling the hotline.
If you want to make a call, please sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see section 'Checking system configuration') and note materials ready. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Graphics and sound card and driver information
The following is a summary of the main points of the report.
I was inspired to develop video games by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new world of possibilities and seemed to me a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I thought, as a pioneer of cinema at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything had yet to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and completely visual. To be honest, the next ten years of my life could not satisfy my creative hunger. I felt that video games could be a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. I was skeptical of the idea of a film that would have a tangible impact on our lives. I was also skeptical of the idea that we could have a completely different experience of the world, and that the ability to create a new game would have to be a fundamental tool for us to fight against the monsters that had been created by the previous generation, but I was also afraid to ask myself, and to answer the question that this is a very important question, because the lack of humanity, both the ability to create and the new, the ability to create, to be able to be both creative and to be creative.

Damage caused by transport
If external transport damage is detectable, it must be immediately reported, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.).
The device is set to the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to VDE regulations, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is intended only for dry rooms. The correct operation of the coinage system requires the correct positioning of the device.
IMPORTANT If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn off the machine briefly (pull the power plug) and then turn it on again.
Before repair, pull out the power plug! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch the parts that are conducting voltage! Even when the device is turned off, the monitor can still produce dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! At the anode connection of the image tube, there are about 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A burned fuse signals overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher quality, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original replacement parts. Never printed circuits / connections when the device is turned on. SERVICE MANUAL Q
Game play
The game is set up so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before the next area (round) can be attacked. At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When alarms are triggered, SPARX SUPER-SPARX and aggressive. If you are trying to enter your area, your mark in your death sign will be blocked, you will not be able to reach the speed limit and will be able to destroy your own fuel fuel, and if you are over 4 seconds behind the speed limit, you will be able to destroy your own fuel and destroy the fuel.
The QIX game is able to test itself, provide data and demonstrate that circuits and controls are working properly. For more information see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted at the volume controller (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.
The following table shows the number of tests to be carried out on the vehicle:
Function: Switch to the next stroke
Programming and testing switch: TEST
Function: Switch to the next program step (display)
Programming and testing switch: up
Function: factory reset (until green), count by 1 step (when green is lit) Programming and testing Switch: Down
Function: counting down by one step
It is possible to install a coin counter in the device, a line to 412 V DC supply, a line to port J 15 - 13 on the ROM/IC board.
The following are the main types of service:
General: Programming and testing is done using the four switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Use programming. This display can determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can set a "maximum number of credits" that can be entered before the start of the game. The next move to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (green), the number of points to be won is set to the "Updated" value or "Sub-Test" indicator. The number of points to be won is set by pressing the "Updated" or "Sub-Test" indicator. The number of points to be won is set to 99 points. If the player is required to add up to a maximum number of points, the number of points can be determined by pressing the "Updated" or "Sub-Test" indicator.
'Throughput' means the percentage that must be reached to switch to the next throughput
'Time limit' means the release of additional Sparx
'Difficulty' means the degree of difficulty of the game
'Turn on tone': at "0" no tone when in standby mode
'Table model' for '1' sound, including standby mode (animation sound): for '0' standby mode
for "1" tableware
The values are used to set to highscores selected on the previous display (set to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button will set the initials to QIX Standard. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. Pressing the "Total Score" button will set the "Up" button to 0 minutes. The minutes recorded are: Total number of credits earned: Total number of credits paid. If the player's hit points and initials are not set to 0 points, including the next 10 point numbers, the values are used to set to highscores selected on the previous display (set to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button will set the initials to QIX Standard. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. Pressing the "Total Score" button will set the "Up" button to 0 minutes. The number of minutes recorded is: Total number of credits earned: Total number of credits earned in the free minutes. If the player does not reach 0 points, the total number of credits earned will be set to 0 points. The number of credits earned starts at 100 000 coins, the number of coins earned is given at 1,000 coins, the number of coins is given at the beginning of the game.
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player has had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting This indicator allows the coin-maker to choose a standard coin setting or to program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not match the default setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After one press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his minting values by selecting a setting that matches his minting values and only the values that are matched by the change of the digit. When the "Test" switch is reached, the setting is adopted. When the "Sub-Test" switch is pressed, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. The "Sub-Test" button indicates that the value of the coin has been reduced by one. The "MONY" button indicates that the minimum value of the coin has been reached. The "MONY" button indicates that the value of the "MON" is lower than the minimum value required. The "MONY" button indicates that the value of the "MON" is lower than the minimum value of the "MON" and can be reduced by pressing the "MON" button.
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates a failure or fault of the battery.
The following table shows the error rates for the different types of data:
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, pressing the "Test" switch will display the next program in each case. If a duration test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. When the "Open Door to Coin Test" (money to check) indicator appears, the program must be removed from the video connector. This test can be performed as follows: 1 J - 19 J = 1 RAM / memory / memory = CMOS / J = 19 Hardware: This test can not be performed with a video connector protected (test results: CMOS / memory = X / memory / memory = J)
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced.
The Communications RAM test determines the operational reliability of memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the grid is holding with the display, a fault has been detected. If the communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or fault in the data board. To locate the fault, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Fault in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
The video board is CMOS RAM.
After values have been entered into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed for correctness when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by inscribing a pattern on each side. The results of these entries are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis shows no RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test will be started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star number 1. The second one is that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable sewing defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was even greater. I had oriented myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in an S or M with my upper.... In the end it would have fit from the length and from the hip... the rest I could swim. Besides, the lining material came to you already when you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just damage.
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good workmanship. It fits well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is absolutely delighted. She usually wears the 158, and you fit the 36 quite well in this case and will probably be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
High quality
I chose the rubber c because I always work with wood on the truck lift and that's not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured too much and the cladding doesn't fit quite. Which is my mistake. Then I slightly changed something to make it fit. The cladding looks very robust and you don't damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Too big for a child under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not less than a year old. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he could not use it for the size. Now at 12 months we have found him again and he can use it. He has not been able to bite anything with his already existing few teeth. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calms him down very much.
Quality not good enough / Unfortunately decreasing
I have been blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to point out in advance that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. I have a very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro backpack has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (almost 29 EUR) on Prime Day and was actually very proud of this purchase, after reading many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came to me yesterday, I was very disappointed: the backpack is not bad for storing equipment, but I can't say that it is bad for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. And I also had to decide that the price of the backpack is very good for me. And I can't really say that the backpack is a good thing for me, but I can't really say that the price is too high for someone else. Unfortunately, the backpack is not as good as it seems, but the price is not as high as it should be. Unfortunately, the backpack is not as easy to buy, but the quality is not as it seems, but the price is too high for many people, so the backpack is not worth it is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, so the backpack is not worth it is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, the product is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the
Unfortunately, disappointed with the third part.
So far, I'd liked E.L. Todd's Electric series best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. In the part the whole time is about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily dragged out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and then with every argument is like a little child and gets involved?! At the same time there were inconsistencies, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand up to him and try to convince the ex that Taylor could not do without him and save himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and I had to fight for Taylor and I hope that the last part of this series would come out at the same time. I think that Sarah also had to read the last part of the series.
Man destroys everything, appreciates nothing and does not learn! First of all: the film is not so bad now, as many write. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and conceived again and again according to the same scheme F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! Often I thought during the film (and although I know that it is only a film, and the animals are from the computer): Oh God, the poor animals, they often shoot tears in your eyes. The film Of Jurassic World has therefore been made really neatly. It is only a pity that my film is not good for humanity and is not always a good message, although it is a consistent, but the last film was made for the environment, because we would have been the same, but according to the principles of Leprosy and arrogance and greed, the last one was made for the environment, and the planet.
A silent film with a sensitive feel.
Some people here expect a film à la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you engage with it and do not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problems
It tastes like quench from the 90s, because of the orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days a package every morning: it didn't move, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation the diarrhea has been for a week. It is worth noting that for the smaller pack size only 2 stars (unfortunately only seen too late) were given, for the larger one a full 5? This is very strange!
terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tinting to a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed immediately that it smelled terrible! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions, with no satisfactory result, again. This time it was a waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked worse at the first attempt. What was the worst of all, after weeks of application it still darkened... I washed my hair often, just didn't change the smell.
Highly recommended
I've been taking the pills for a long time now and always take one pill every five days. My vitamin budget has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a long additional illness. So I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the pills. Absolutely recommended.
Function not quite flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with time to "connect" with the mobile phone. This means that it does not charge anymore even if you press the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and reinstall it, you will solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this will create a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the cover is so worn that it detaches from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although this is not a lot of defects, but I find that with a case it works just for its battery function for over 3 months, and that is why I have disposed of the product for free, especially since I have used it for over 30€ of the cost.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. After all, it's actually a spectacle towel, which you get in a slightly smaller form as a gift from every optician. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself much more of these towels. It's also really very thin. Since I've used it, I can't exchange it anymore. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far overstated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker that I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately, broke. Basically, the onforu works great, is waterproof (my shcon fell in the shower), gives bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Socket must be watered, of course, otherwise it will dissolve... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes... what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into higher frequencies. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the frequency are almost hurting the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough. My bass speaker has not been good enough to reproduce sound, but I have found that the bass frequency has been reduced, which is why I have to listen to the bass speaker quite often, but unfortunately I have not heard the bass speaker quite as well as I expected, so I have not really been able to reduce the sound in the onforum.
very bad
The paint was splintered in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint would come off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only exchange the damaged parts but like if both the dresser was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all of this for us and sent us the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The items are delivered, which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the mailman stuffed the product directly into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not fault it, because I urgently needed this product. The supplied glue hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not become hard. Already a day after the glue almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the glue material did not dry out (at least these 5 days after the glue was still not dry), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are high in value and I would be happy to invest a little more money for the product and use it for a party.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + nice look + stable when built + shelf board can be positioned any way
- Doors pop by magnets (maybe rubber cups can compensate) - Some dirty spots
- the supplied dumbbells are much too small and wobbly (didn't have any others and didn't have them because there was no cup in the house, glued with DIY glue) - the supports for the inlay floor wobble a bit (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: if it didn't look so good and had such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Besides, I also find it a little too expensive for that.
I like the coffee, but...
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have given 5* Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all). Also the additional plastic waste (packaged separately see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects full score soon.
♪ I'm getting a little tired of it ♪
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't make them any quieter either. Probably a defect, supposedly this was possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I fall out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the walls with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. But then when it was time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately to me. The bright colors and the color change I liked, unfortunately you can't turn the light colored. I also found it had a good battery so that the power went out at one time and the clock didn't go out, but the reason I called it back was because the time had to be changed.
Light is super, processing is insufficient
I replaced four lamps in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a frame - instead, a plate laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "6 pay - 4 get" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have handled this coolly and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two stars. The light itself is superb. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color is rather cold white. For the floor, work, my kitchen, etc. I would be perfect for evaluating living rooms personally to be warmer with the help of Durchaus Light. I can compare this to a good old 100 birch lamp and I can also try to answer all the other questions quickly, but I am happy to get a positive answer about this.
That's great.
I received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them. ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. ** They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ° F. ** They do not transfer heat and can be touched directly. ** The dishwasher does, however, sometimes leave water stains on the black silicone. But after a short wipe, they are gone. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-commodities sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping easy top. delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked faucet and tested all parts.We found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we had to find significant scratches, abrasions. The screws / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chrome faucet itself there are scratch marks / slicks. This part has probably been delivered and sent back. We keep this faucet and build it in the sink in the basement because there is one no matter how it looks. Unsuccessful; never order such goods again via Amazon but we prefer to give more in the original goods where we get it just so that customers will be scared to wear clothes!!!
The product itself is top notch, but the external sensor is broken after 6 months.
I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the range of sensors is very good, there are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device attractive. It is very simple and can be mounted on the wall or as a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be intact, plausible values are still shown here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably correct, because there are always completely astronomical values of the external humidity. It is a pity that the device was installed outside in one place and that is why I gave this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt was still running smoothly with Hermes across the Republic today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a good impression on me. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cut. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but okay. The big drawback is unfortunately the fishing basket. Firstly, it is only top and bottom of hard plastic and between them of fabric. If you fully disconnect it only for a short time, then it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. But very bad, that actually the practical filling level is half an inch already on the full catch basket. That is not so bad, yes, but it is not always so bad for the big cut, but if I have the design of the basket, it would be impossible to lose the big parts of the fish, so I have to go back to the design of the basket. So I have a solution: the design of the large fish basket is not always so good, but if I had to go back to the design of the large fish, I would have to the solution: the whole structure of the fish basket would be broken down.
Good equipment for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. Very good is the included plug-in sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save the battery are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be locked quite dimly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it in the router's nets. The batteries have to be removed and reconnected after a short break, then the battery should be disconnected again. - Actually, there is still a problem with the alarm.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY is a very good idea.
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear fastening screw is fully fitted, but the hotbed is still too high and the right front screw falls out, because it is not fitted at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods hold the car straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it is impossible to print something. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very tiring. I have already written to support but after a week I still did not get a response. Sorry, I have no more hat. I am not expecting anything.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
My old measuring device has unfortunately died after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one looks very robust and is just as accurate after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so it can be started immediately. The packaging of the device is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the device does not leave any wishes open and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it will last at least as long as the old measuring device. From now on there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
The disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and for the time being I haven't worn it because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, that smell hasn't gone away, even though it was constantly "ventilated". Since it's no longer possible to return it, I discarded it. Discount from purchase
For the price, okay.
The stars and spheres on this chain are a little too big for me personally, so it seems quite solid. The larger spheres are free to move, which I find quite nice. However, the chain as a whole is very easy to handle, so I've already ripped the cap off twice. So far I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
A very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple lock actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more pliable. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the lock is made of steel!
Unfortunately, I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I felt that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now for the function: connect only after some trickery.... you follow the instructions it does not work at all, only after I had removed a battery from the base station again and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, this was not so useful for me! Thing returned! Would recommend against any purchase, in any case, only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted. I bought it again for one reason only, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction pipe and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slide was broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump in the future a little better than using only a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump, as described above, despite the fact that I urgently needed the pump and the rust in the pump did not affect the performance of the pump.
I could have thought about it better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that an organizer like this is more pleasant than running around with a huge keychain all the time. At first everything went quite well. However, then the paint ran off quite quickly and the screws had to be pulled back. It's nice that this can be done with a penny, but also with a penny. I have not found a suitable slit-screw-drawer that would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now to get to the most important part of the whole thing: the attachment of the key. The nice thing is that you can put the screw through the different parts, the screw in different sizes or lengths, but then you should have screwed the whole thing, but then you can buy a whole piece to bring the whole thing together again. This is a complex assembly, but then you can only use it for the price, and then you can never buy the screw again. Finally, the third thing is to balance the entire winding and the whole thing.
Not entirely conform to the dimensions indicated
Lightweight zippers, the material looks sturdy and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after the first use. In advance I can already say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can not really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be directly in the suitcase - as before. It is also worth noting that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag still contained two smaller bags / bags. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention this. However, the fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color tone and is made of other material, the bags do not bother me personally. I do not see the price-performance ratio as an example.
So there.
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas, but now when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So I could have just tossed the money in the trash.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. An improvement in the sound I could not hear on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. With them were two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The earmuffs are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also the weight is kept very low. Recommendation to buy in this price range.
A dress of elegance
Very nice dress, which is well worn for all occasions.. price-performance is completely consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the flash sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the cut wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could also handle a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger off. It can't get any worse. I really and truly didn't expect such a piece of junk to be sold nowadays. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports provide enough power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually runs, Blu-rays are detected with maximum unreliability. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes clanging noises like you haven't heard since the 90s old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing is detected or the disc is finally detected. But then you must not press any button or jump to a chapter during the pause or change the sound of the film. If you buy this DVD or any other software that doesn't come with a Blu-ray, it will of course cost you nothing.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually a blink of an eye, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging some devices there and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and had I only needed a slight extension, I would certainly not have bought this shapeless lump with gold plugs. But apart from the looks and my miscalculation, the extension performs its service very reliably. And by the weight of the plug, the plugged USB stick doesn't move around as easily as it would with a normal extension. So no real miscalculation, but my ears are ringing.
I bought this product so I can connect an audio output and a display to the iPad (Pro). With iOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters I had to send back could not do this, unfortunately. Practically, the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Audio is delivered via HDMI. What I use my PlayStation P for: There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also a magnetic support. My case does not fit the adapter. Well, it also keeps in contact and therefore is safe... Everything, however, is very expensive because it fits in the middle of all the wireless devices. Aluminum performance is still very justified in a small price.
Any quantity of power
It's a great device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not light or quiet, but it's quite powerful. I find the temperature setting a bit too cool, so I'm always on level two. It's also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with a weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and we are positively surprised that in live mode the location is felt to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode if the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, which is not a problem. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 days. Here would be a super solution that would last 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, so the battery would not last with us and we also find it inconvenient to change it daily. You should not deal with the dog with his collar.:-)  The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, garbage.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life span is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in gym class, after a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair was also in normal use, so they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class. Unfortunately it was not so. The shoes are more expensive garbage and absolutely not to be recommended.
Perfect fit - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after five years, so I was happy to order new ones. These, unfortunately, are poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly made and the retainer on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like mine before. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it for good luck. The mattress and an air pump were included in the package. As for the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it will not reappear. In the pumped state, a direct delivery test was carried out. It can be placed on it well and fits super well to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace the hard bed, but for the days of the event itself it is of pure luxury. Since the mattress fits wonderfully in my car. The mattress is perfectly suited to the back seat. Before we have the pumps, we have to put the adapters out. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it does not reappear again. In the pumped state, a direct delivery test was carried out. It can be put on it. Of course, this mattress cannot replace the hard bed, but for the days of the event it is of pure luxury. Since the mattress fits wonderfully into my car. The mattress and an air pump were included in the delivery. As a car, the mattress and an air pump were included. I put it was tested it was tested. I put it out for a bit on the car (Citroen Berlingo) before the car (Citroen Berlingo.

Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately the calendar is torn open by the lip processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly because they almost pleased him. The parts often come out wrong which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled during the game, parts fall off. (Most of the front decoration. This can also be very badly attached again.) I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Eventually the manufacturer of the calendar made it better for the next edition.
a real drone
I'm very excited about the drone. My seven-year-old daughter flies it. Inside it flies very well and the five minutes of flight time are usually quite enough. The fact that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks down very quickly I did not expect anything different with the price, but falls from the ceiling to the ground, whether it is tiles or carpet, are no problem. If there are questions of nice contact.
ok but only with compulsion to Steam playable. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is a shame. Since then the computer is constantly hanging, which would not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails on the battery life.
I was looking forward to the watch. Design and appearance great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. There are big hooks: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, overnight only on the drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery if not used. Came a day many messages, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, for me not useful. Very sorry.
Noble Envelope with Restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 +, you should definitely get a cover. I recently liked covers in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the cover here offers. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the cover is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather cover makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks noble. The phone is unlike many other covers around, only at the connectors are gaps. Otherwise, you can easily operate the single-board and silencer on the sides through the cover. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge on QI devices, even through the thickness of the cover. You can charge the phone well from the cover. The leather cover is not as well processed and can only be properly charged on the Galaxy S4 - like the QI LORS - if the earphone is not properly charged.
a high-quality casing with a glass-reinforced film
Rugged case with a real armored glass as a protection for the screen in a classic design offers a round protection for the whole iPhone 11. fits very well and can also be easily lifted. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good purchase.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism is caused by the transport of fetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism may cause SSc in some patients via a fetal-antimaternal graft-versus-host-like reaction.

Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not appear until adulthood, and it is then called adult-onset Still's disease.
Diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthema, joint discomfort, febrile and leukocytic episodes, liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and absence of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two long-term adult patients whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
Mr. Still's exanthem is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply defined macules that are very volatile.
A slight friction in the exanthemal groove can trigger erythematous Köbner phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthem.

The evaluation of melanocytic tumours represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnosis in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria shall be required for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or melanocytic nevus of differential diagnosis.
The prognostically relevant tumour parameters relevant to the therapeutic approach must be fully and consistently included in the histopathological report for malignant melanoma.
The recommendations of the Working Group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarised below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children present a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective treatment and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
The main causes are infections with a wide range of pathogens, with the usual bacterial pathogens being Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegalovirus (CMV), fungi, tuberculosis bacteria and respiratory viruses.
However, in 25-30% of cases, the respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
A medical history, a lung X-ray, or a blood test are often of little help in making a diagnosis.
However, analysis of material from the respiratory tract often leads to the diagnosis of:
Nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum (possibly induced by inhalation of saline) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage provides diagnostic clarity in 60-80%, the remaining cases must be diagnosed by a mostly open lung biopsy at the appropriate clinic.
The majority of those affected are young to middle-aged women.

A preliminary examination should be performed to determine whether there is evidence of ultrasonic analgesia in patients with non-radical low back pain on serial application, depending on the prescribed power density (LD).
A review of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult to repair mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and slightly dislocated fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can also be successfully treated by monocortical mini-plate osteosynthesis.
The survey of pre- and intraoperative parameters describing the nature of a mandibular fracture and additively forming a key value for classifying trauma appears to be a pioneering approach to an appropriate differential indication between the two therapeutic approaches.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations to describe a lower jaw trauma that all the studies carried out so far, with their small number of cases, can at best provide a rough differential indication.
Until a prospective multicenter study is available that could provide guidance in the choice of osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid range between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that allows comprehensive analysis of a tumour genome for over- and under-representation of DNA sections.
In order to make quantitative and reproducible statements about genetic aberrations, software has been developed which enables the objective detection of the location and type of changes.
The result is represented by a CGH sum-karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these studies is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms and thus to obtain a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical procedures can be precisely planned and simulated using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bone structures, created from a patient's tomography data.
Computerised navigation systems or robotic systems may be used to assist in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned plan and in spatial orientation at the operating site.
After more than 30 years of successful centralisation of laboratory analysis, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in whole blood and the reduction of laboratory analyses are increasingly leading to a new decentralisation of laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed near the patient outside of central or decentralised laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample volumes.
These benefits are often highlighted but are not associated with any clearly discernible clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/ or maintenance of analytical equipment by untrained station personnel, lack of or inadequate calibration and/ or quality control, cost of storing multiple devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation, and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also apparent.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should be made only in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure the usefulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation (24h central laboratory, etc.), the POCT parameters should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analyte required for this should be:
Haemoglobin or haematocrit, activated whole blood coagulation time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and safety aspects are required.
Rapid and ultra-fast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast media and thermosensitive contrast media are discussed.
The range of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MRI is still in its early stages of development.
The potential of MRI is to become a major player in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Chronic renal failure patients have characteristic skeletal changes that are not seen in other patients.
The aim of the present studies was to fully record the changes in bone mass of the spine during long-term haemodialysis from C2 - L5.
Of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spinal examinations were complete.
A newly developed preparation technique allows the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be directly analyzed.
The quantity of the test substance was evaluated in terms of vertebral body height (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular junction (TBPf).
The spine deformity index (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in ROP types I and II despite a trabecular volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control group.
However, the declining plateau-like curve from HWS to LWS is 5% lower for the ROPs.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding pelvic scalp biopsy.
The patients on longer haemodialysis had higher BV/TV values regardless of age or gender.
Normal BV/TV is not equivalent to physiological spongiform enlargement and functional static.
The three dimensional analysis in ROP gives a much greater restructuring of the architecture than can be derived on the 2D cut planes and trabecular bone volumes compared to the controls.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and therefore functional spongiform architecture in patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis.
In 1700, French surgeon Alexandre de Littré first described a form of hernia of the groin that, due to its course and the results of the dissection performed by Littré himself, did not correspond to what was known until then.
A hundred years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this sagging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall fracture in a scientific paper on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré hernia" in the German-speaking world.
A case report is used to trace the history of this form of hernia.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the disease picture received increasing attention, and was not included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 until 1988 and in the DSM-IV until 1994.
The cause of the disturbance is unknown.
A patient is presented with the typical features of Asperger's syndrome, with epilepsy and internal abnormalities.
Possible co-morbidities of Asperger's syndrome, such as epilepsy, are discussed alongside the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic approach.
Yersinia infections usually manifest themselves in childhood as febrile gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
One child has been reported with Yersinia infection manifested as long-term persistent tumour-like lymphadenitis localized to the mesenteric root.
The diagnosis was made by repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer Yersinia membrane proteins.
All clinical findings were normalised only after treatment with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was studied prospectively in 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were asked as to what conclusions the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation could lead to and what consequences these findings might have.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy has not been able to determine the cause of death.
A wealth of scientific data was presented at this workshop, which highlighted the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for the future of tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old female patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy and subsequently the appearance of septic shock.
In addition, Staphylococcus epidermidis, the second Propionibacterium acnes, was detected in this own blood canister.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It is clear that autologous haemotherapy also carries a risk of infection which cannot be underestimated and that the re-transfusion of one's own blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezzars in the renal pelvis are an uncommon manifestation of a severe infection by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature neonate with VACTERL association who, following candida sepsis, developed fungal bezzores in the renal pelvis leading to hydronephrosis with onset of posthal renal failure.
Normalisation of excretion was observed with antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine and with direct rinsing with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy.
With the increasing incidence of systemic candida infections, particularly in neonatology, the possibility of bezoar formation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective treatment for acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
It has now been shown that some patients do not respond to this therapy or do not respond sufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, two groups of 20 responders and 20 non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the following parameters:
Skin type, minimum erythematous dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in the peripheral blood.
In contrast, non-responders were shown to have significantly higher atopy scores, increased total IgE and specific IgE titers than responders.
In addition, a comparatively high incidence of skin Staphylococcus aureus and intestinal Candida albicans was observed in non-responders.
These findings indicate that high dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterised by a particularly severe atopic syndrome on the one hand and complicated superinfections on the other.
The latter finding suggests that a combination of high dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal therapy may be of benefit to these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare form of lupus erythematosus.
Two case studies illustrate the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Clinically, subcutaneous glandular and plaque infiltrates are present, which may lead to ulceration and scarring.
Histologically, there is a lobular paniculitis.
A positive direct immunofluorescence (lupus band) test with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermoepidermal border and vessels is also considered as an additional diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance as lupus erythematosus profundus may predate systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with a history of more than 45 years.
The patient died with clinical signs of cardiac low-output syndrome due to a vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicological analysis.
The pathogenesis and the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic effects of chloroquine are presented.
In the last 5-7 years there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of the development of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatments for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarises the results of experimental and clinical studies on the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific advances in medicine, more and more patients are being operated on with pre-existing conditions, in old age, with reduced cardiac pumping function, after previous heart surgeries and in emergency conditions.
This requires risk stratification, which divides the operational risk into 'low','medium' and 'high'.
Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patient, structural and treatment related factors can be distinguished.
The aim of this forecast is to optimise the perioperative course by means of individually tailored preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative, multiprofessional and interdisciplinary organised management.
Patients have an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumours, particularly spinaliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanoma, one spinal cancer, and a lymph node metastasis of a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complement analysis, resulting in a classification in complement group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies of the chest, thoracic wall and/ or abdominal wall that have been untreated for years and have been exulsified in the meantime, will ask the plastic surgeon for major defect coverings after tumor resection.
The use of silver-containing activated carbon film (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn) prevented infection after flank replacement by an omentum plastic during resection of an extended basal cell.
After secondary mesh burial, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable hull wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The 2000 healthcare reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German healthcare system.
The monopoly of hospitals for inpatient care and of established contract doctors for outpatient care is not affected.
The hospital's budgeting remains.
In future, compulsory catalogues will be required for outpatient operations which cannot be performed in a hospital.
The quality assurance obligation is specified and strengthened.
A new DRG-based pricing system is introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multi-organ failure is a complex immunological process influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurring systemically and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-8, and the inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and systemically.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may ultimately also help us better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumours are usually nonspecific.
X-rays often show only lightening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radio-opacitites.
Root-tip resorptions may be another important finding.
After a brief historical outline, the current state of knowledge is briefly described for each type, based on the currently valid WHO classification.
This is then used to develop the current treatment approach, which divides all 22 tumour entities into a total of four groups:
The following are the most commonly reported malignancies: malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent.
Generalized happiness disorder (GHD) is a mental disorder, often late in its diagnosis, characterized by a uniformity of emotional experience in the face of circumstances that are usually the cause of depressive mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusation or aggression towards others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person concerned and prevent adverse long-term consequences for the individual and society.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease requiring rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment.
Despite effective antibacterial antibiotics, the mortality rate has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapeutic regimen that specifically interferes with the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimise neurological damage and save the patient's life.
This article presents the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy, with particular attention to molecular pathophysiological processes in CNS inflammation.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/ Denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly useful in distinguishing bone lesions from neighbouring anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique will enable the accurate characterization of pathologies including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In the absence of knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), a causal treatment is not possible.
The majority of the currently available oral IC therapy studies were not randomised, double-blind, or placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
Therefore, no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC has been developed to date.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple blisters on his back after suffering a severe sunburn.
Clinical and histopathological studies show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolitic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis, seborrheic keratoses or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective horning.
Epidermolitic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be distinguished from severe congenital corneal abnormalities that exhibit the same histological phenomenon as epidermolitic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, anti-fibrinolytic agents are now commonly used in extracorporeal circulation (ECC) procedures in cardiac anaesthesia.
However, there are also concerns about its potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECG should be compared.
It describes the diagnostic imaging of manubriostar-alveolar arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient.
The involvement of the manubrium (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional radiodiagnostics and arthrosonography of the manubriostal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomised for endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics consistent with the first group of patients in the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.
This retrospective work should examine the functional outcomes of surgical treatment.
Heinrich Heine was a child who experienced an episode of pseudologia phantastica.
The determining factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this paper.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late stages of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis and the therapeutic effect depending on the HLA B27 characteristic are to be evaluated.
The present study presents the medical history of a patient with severe OCD since the age of 14.
It is not a separate OCD but a schizophrenia masked by OCD symptoms.
In the one-year history of treatment with clozapine for exacerbated schizophrenic symptoms at age 31, there were no psychotic symptoms and no significant compulsive symptoms.
While the literature increasingly refers to OCD as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication range of chronic schizophrenia, this article describes, to the author's knowledge, the rare case of clozapine-relieved OCD in schizophrenia.
The importance of differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed on the basis of the case study.
The isomorphic stimuli effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin response to non-specific skin stimuli.
The initiation of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient is reported by UVB light testing at levels above 0.055 J/cm2.
The case of a 28-year-old patient is also described, in whom new psoriasis clusters developed in the viral inflorescences after a varicella infection.
Since the person concerned was planning to spend several months abroad in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory chemical examinations were carried out.
The presentation was made to rule out oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to ask whether there are genetic risk factors for developing such a disease, and to ask whether rheumatic factors can occur as a vaccine reaction;
Initial experience and results are reported with 13 simultaneous reconstructions of large head-neck complex defects with 8 microvascularly anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major islet lobes.
Complete loss of the lapis never occurred.
The free forearm transplant provided better functional and aesthetic results, but the surgery times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
The disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are mainly the poor modellability and a limited rotational radius.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli which may trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, characterised by increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This allows circulating immune cells to adhere to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory perivascular cell filtrates in the affected tissue area.
Whereas previously the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was considered to be the primary prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, evidence has recently emerged that exogenous factors can induce endothelial cells to an inflammatory state without the mediation of cytokines.
For example, endothelial adhesion molecules may be induced by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, ultraviolet and ionising radiation, or mechanical shear forces.
Endothelial cells are thus not only subject to the control of tissue mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.) but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, particularly after combined cataract/ glaucoma operations, are an indication for the local administration of rTPA.
We'll report back on our findings.
A case of benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node, first described 5 years ago and not yet documented in German literature, is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of myofibroblast cells (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) arranged in a palisade-like manner, its diagnostic criteria include peripherally accentuated hemorrhagic zones and the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which correspond ultrastrukturally to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumour identity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasia.
The increased strength of 2 parallel inner rails has reduced obstruction and kinking and reduced congestion of the proximal cavity system.
In addition to the flow of urine within the rails, this technique also allows for increased flow between the rails, which is considered to be the key mechanism of urine passage in recumbent urethral tracks.
In cases of extrinsic urethral compression where insertion of a singular internal splint does not provide sufficient regression of the ectasia of the anterior intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J urethral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication treatment alternative that may spare some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomycatheter or more invasive procedures.
Of the minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc events (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/ APLD/ laser decompression/ chemonucleolysis), intradiscal application of chymopapain is the method with the longest clinical duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis allows an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy, which closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
A prospective study should be conducted to evaluate the value of diuresis sonography compared to the diuresis nephrogram (the'gold standard ') in children with urinary tract disorders.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.
The method has been developed and modified over the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same objective:
radical tumour removal while preserving the non-infected surrounding tissue.
However, they differ substantially in the technique of excision, the attachment of the histological sections and the histological evaluation of the preparation.
A methodological inventory is made and differences, advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The Marjolin ulcer is characterised by a more aggressive behaviour towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the back of his right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combination of radiation therapy and surgery.
The extensive soft tissue defect after a correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde-style A. radialis flap.
Opioids of the spinal cord provide good analgesia for a wide range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic adverse reactions than with epidural administration of local anaesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anaesthetics in the management of postoperative pain, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCA), is presented.
The intrathecal route of administration is considered to have several advantages over the epidural route.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids is dependent on different forms of administration.
There is no clinical advantage of a thoracic injection over a lumbar injection in terms of the quality of analgesia, serious adverse reactions, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative lung function.
There is evidence that the type of pain treatment has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics and/ or opioids is the first choice and cost-effective method for patients at high preoperative risk.
The German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK) cooperate in Germany to collect the results of standardized epicutane tests centrally at the participating centres.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, perfume mix, perubalzam and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also prepared for defined patient groups (by sex, age, eczema location, geographical region, occupation, sensitisation) and specific questions.
The percentage of positive reactions for nickel, perfume mix and balsamic ointment was markedly lower for men than for women.
Younger patients responded more frequently to thimerosal, older patients to external medicine.
Medical allergens were also found to be positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found to be more common in hand eczema patients.
Nickel and fragrance allergy sufferers had higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of diagnosis and prevention of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all persons infected with M. leprae (who have been in contact with it), the disease does not occur in an open outbreak.
The clinical manifestation is determined less by the direct effects of bacterial infection than by the T-cell mediated immune response.
This review article considers current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies have been presented on the quantitative investigation of the phenomenon of the vortex in the chamber water (KW) by means of laser vortex measurement.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS compared to the vortex intensity in the KW at different locations, it should be examined, for example, to what extent the vortex rise is actually caused by a BKS disturbance.
The present experimental study examines the effect of acamprosate, a glutamate modulator, and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on neurological deficit following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
Attempts to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses have so far failed.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the basic problems of nerve regeneration.
The strong defence reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units which are indispensable for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal test results do not stand up to clinical review because in animal testing poor regeneration performance may occur despite impaired regeneration pathway.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their late effects is the major gynaecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two thirds of HIV-infected women developed symptoms of genitourinary infections, one third developed cervical dysplasia.
A quarter of these had chronic complaints and late effects of ascending genital infections.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-type opportunistic infections, but usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhoea (17%) or hypermenorrhoea were observed in a higher proportion.
The most common complications of pregnancy are premature labour (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth.
Progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy has not been observed.
Risks for peripartal infection transmission to foetuses include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as prematurity, preterm labour, amniotic fluid infection, duration of bladder rupture and labour, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternal-foetal HIV-1 transmission can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low contamination cesarean delivery (4-6%), and most successfully by primary cesarean section and concomitant prenatal, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells are central to the initiation of the immune response, as they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system, able to activate T lymphocytes via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies in patients with treatment-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitised to tumour antigens in vitro can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
As for laryngeal carcinoma, there are currently few basic data on the presence of dendritic cells in tumour tissue and their function, the present study investigated the immunohistological localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis.
The results show that, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
Comparison with clinical parameters shows that patients with low dendritic cell counts in the carcinoma (< 100/ cells/ mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favourable prognostic factor for the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered a significant factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure.
In addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two pathways of degradation, transulphurisation (formation of cystathionin, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were also determined in the present study in patients with renal insufficiency.
We're reporting two cases of feline scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
Suspicion is based on cat scratches in the history and the typical findings of swollen lymph nodes in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to obtain an insight into the frequency and clinical status of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients treated in a university clinic or a dermatological practice between 1984 and 1994 was carried out on the basis of patient records and, in some cases, also by follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 patients (31 women, 25 men) 49 had the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean duration of illness 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
Atopy was present in 46.4% of patients and 23.2% had other forms of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests have only been positive in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During antibiotic treatment (penicillin 1-2 mIU/ day for 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracycline 2 g/ day for 2 weeks, n=10) complete remission occurred in 13 patients and improvement was seen in 8 patients.
In 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%), spontaneous remission occurred over a follow-up period of 6.5 years.
The surprisingly good treatment successes with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further investigation of the pathogenesis of this disease, including a possible infectious cause.
Summary A case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented with primary lumbar pain is reported.
The findings, both laboratory-chemical, radiological and histopathological, were primarily indicative of the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excises, histologically, the picture of non-specific inflammation was found.
It was only during the biopsy carried out as part of the implant removal that a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma could be histologically detected.
Chemotherapy was given according to the CHOP regimen and radiotherapy was given.
Spinal lymphomas should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in the case of progressive disease.
Fractures of the nasoethmoid orbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with medial facial fractures and/ or fronto-basal fractures in more than 90% of cases.
In up to 70% of cases, the accompanying fractures of the skull base pass through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa.
Different approaches exist for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and cranial base fractures in mid-face fractures.
In the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial and Facial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and mid-face fractures without involvement of the cranial base, repositioning and care was provided via a subcranial access route.
47 Patients were followed up for up to 4 years and their data were evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extracranial and transcranial care of fractures of the ethmoidal bone involving the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
However, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding during and after surgery.
In an obese 50-year-old female patient with familial hypophosphataemia and V. a. phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be operated upon.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in endtidal partial pressure of CO2, an increase in paCO2 and a circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures were immediately initiated with cardiac pressure massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In the case of V. a. fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed under continuous cardiac pressure massage.
After 21/4 hours of CPR and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable haemodynamics were achieved with continuous, high dose catecholamine administration and volume replacement.
A massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss of coagulopathy.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was able to be moved from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made based on the clinic, captometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were avoided.
In anaesthesia with the new inhalation anaesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total administered dose is metabolised.
The magnitude of the resulting serum peaks of inorganic fluoride are determined primarily by the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anaesthetic administered and the solubility of the anaesthetic gas, expressed in terms of its blood gas partition coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane may increase the risk of renal complications.
However, no increased renal hazard potential for fluoride exposure to sevoflurane was demonstrated in the animal studies, in routine clinical use, in prolonged anaesthesia, or in patients with renal insufficiency.
The recently demonstrated low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - as opposed to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered to be an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 μmol/l, still used in the literature, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane but is not valid for the anaesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those found, inter alia, following anaesthesia with sevoflurane, are therefore to be classified as clinically safe.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence of direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of the macroscopic method of preparation is of fundamental importance for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischaemic heart disease.
The best results are obtained by basic parallel lamellation of the cardiac ventricles after fixation and by the corrective lamellation of any additional coronary arteries that have been calcified, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can be performed.
This procedure allows for a better understanding of the distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the length, circumference and transmural extension of infarcts, their age and subsequent conditions, and their association with the respective coronary supply area than in the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood flow.
The degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occlusive thrombosis can be assessed intact in the coronary arteries, as well as therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in acute cardiac death and short-lived territorial ischemia.
The systematic collection of transmural samples for histology may also allow early myocardial damage to be detected in correlation to coronary morphology and coronary supply area.
However, recent prospective randomised trials show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy does not provide an additional survival benefit after R0 resection.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy in both squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus and adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus, oesophagogastric transition and stomach are inconclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumours, no convincing prognostic benefit was demonstrated in several Phase III studies with preoperative radiation, chemotherapy or combined radiation/ chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach is only expected in response to pretreatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radiation/ chemotherapy improves response rates, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy should therefore only be used in prospective studies in carefully selected patients in specialised centres with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rare condition.
This unusual condition for childhood is usually associated only with certain metabolic disorders.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or 'hysterical' symptoms are understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Non-assimilated memories of trauma are re-traumatising and must be defended by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm or social 'acting'.
In this psychodynamic context, we propose a dream therapy that implements the experiences of hypnotherapy and catathymic-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the imagination in a resource-oriented way.
The real trauma work is a measured, steady confrontational but minimally retraumatising approach to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and letting go.
The final phase is again about the resource-oriented approach to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments in a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the past 20 years in terms of diagnoses and the proportion of multiple disabilities.
Chronic benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the aetiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ('pseudotumor cerebri'), venous drainage obstruction is a possible cause.
The extent to which the visus remains stable in diabetic retinopathy long after vitrectomy has been investigated and the causes and risk factors for worsening of the visus can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by most disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the gateway.
After inoculation, HIV can begin to multiply within 24 hours, and the virus spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody testing can detect emerging HIV infection within four to 12 weeks, and antibody response is reduced by therapy;
The test is carried out on a sample of the test substance.
In the course of nearly 100 years of development, countless tissues from the body, from outside the body, and from synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favoured autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadruple tendon transplant of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon transplant are of the greatest clinical importance.
The use of cadaveric grafts is also justified with some limitations.
The specific differences in the biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal of each graft are not unique to each other.
Clinical trials have not demonstrated a clear superiority of any of the above-mentioned transplants.
The selection of grafts must take into account the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
Careful preoperative planning is required in the management of complex ligament injuries and revision cases, with modified transplant selection if necessary.
The rare course of development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed in the left corners of the mouth.
The histological examination showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, and the presence of pleomorphic adenoma was no longer detectable.
Clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and histological characteristics are discussed in the light of the literature.
Coronary calcification is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately by electron beam tomography.
The clinical relevance differs depending on whether the calcium screening is performed in patients with known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant sub-aspect of coronary heart disease.
This paper presents the frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects with regard to ergometry, and provides guidance for prognostic evaluation and practical conclusions.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immuno-thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes, respectively, and we are currently investigating the potential for the development of a combination of these conditions.
In the 3 patients, the two conditions occurred in the context of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we did not observe any case of ITP in approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immuno-thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, further disorders from the category of autoimmune polyendocrine disorders type II should be excluded.
The maintenance of the airways after surgery in the upper respiratory tract may be problematic in certain patients.
Therefore, safe re-intubation should be ensured if necessary.
Two patients with significant intubation difficulties and therefore high risk factors for intubation and possibly reintubation in general anaesthesia due to recurrent papillary thyroid cancer or inoperable hypopharynx cancer have been reported.
A fiber optically placed endotracheal guide wire was used as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable complementary tests for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for staging and therapy is essential for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive tests for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottis, paraglottis, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity of both methods is less than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumour spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two dissection procedures is clinically important as it allows the exclusion of neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumours, both CT and MRI provide valuable information on possible aetiology, the extent of submucosal growth and the appropriate site of biopsy.
The implantation of cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachycardia.
Patients with end-stage renal failure have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only small numbers of cases of PTCA in patients on chronic dialysis, suggesting a high overall peri-interventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We studied the restenosate levels in 23 patients with end-stage renal failure (17 males, 6 females, middle-aged:
The average age of the population is 52.5 +/- 18.3 years.
After primary successful PTCA, all patients underwent a coronary angiography within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic monitoring, 12 patients reported the reappearance of pectangineous complaints.
Laboratory chemistry showed that the patients had hypertriglyceridaemia (265 +/- 160 mg/ dl) and hypercholesterolaemia (258 +/- 53 mg/ dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/ dl) and a significantly increased fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/ dl).
A case is described of a 64-year-old female patient whose pelvic floor became completely unstable within a year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings.
A minor pelvic trauma was considered as a retrospective triggering event.
The X-ray morphology of multiple pseudoaarthrosis led to the differential diagnosis of the disease with the suspicion of malignancy as the first priority.
A wide range of different conditions are considered to be the cause of hip pain in childhood.
The non-traumatic causes are mainly included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations and to avoid missing necessary therapeutic steps.
Examples of some common but also less common diseases are given.
Iatrogenic rupture of the trochanter major in the prosthetic management of femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg in the so-called "back access" prosthesis implantation could be predisposing.
The few literature sources recommend early functional conservative treatment for isolated and used for comparison traumatic dry-burst, even with considerable fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still a controversial issue.
The present work presents the role of design in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic interventions.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are further investigated using data from quality assurance.
The ZUF-8 examines relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, further patient use behaviour and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This shows that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
In other areas of use, dissatisfied and satisfied patients differ.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic employment relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the employment relationship.
The effects found are relatively large, but in absolute terms they are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction with their treatment.
Changes in the aging process of the male are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal males.
Although testosterone levels decline with age on average, correlations between middle- and later-life disorders and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, inter alia, to methodological limitations of the available studies, the high variability of testosterone levels with age, unclear reference values for older men, and multiple influences (health status and behaviour) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with five days of dyspnoea was subjected to a pre-planned lysotherapy ultrasound, based on nuclear medicine evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
We found a right atrial floating thrombus.
In the presence of acute vital danger, ultra-high dose short-term streptokinase (UHSK) lysis with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely and the leg thrombosis had largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in road traffic accidents.
A single fracture was observed in 50% of patients, with the remaining patients having either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
The average length of hospital stay was 17 days and the average length of crutches was 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid recovery.
The majority (85%) of patients had no complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) patients with open fractures and in only 2 (0.4%) patients with closed fractures, which is within the normal range.
Based on our findings and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthetic plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The extent of the diagnosis of distant metastases in head and neck tumours is still controversial.
The present retrospective study examined the factors influencing the frequency and location of distant metastasis in 1,087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 cases (1.6%) at the time of primary tumour diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastasis was positively correlated with the initial tumour stage (p< 0.00001) and with the manifestation of local and/ or regional recurrence (p< 0.00001) or second tumour outside the ENT region (p< 0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumour localization' and 'histopathological tumour grading' did not have any independent predictive value, but mainly reflected different frequencies of tumour stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in tumours of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to a chest X-ray.
Further diagnostic imaging, including abdomensography, skeletal scintigraphy and/ or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumours, recurrent tumours and secondary tumours outside the CNS.
However, the question of the therapeutic consequences should always be considered in each individual case.
This article gives a brief history of spine surgery from the late 19th century to the present.
Ernst Simmel was one of a small circle of early psychoanalysts who worked with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of a first psychoanalytic polyclinic in 1919 in Berlin and a first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in 1927 in Germany.
The rediscovery of his pioneering role can also be seen as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism, with its consequences for the various historical divisions of the trade unions.
He is a credible figure of professional identification across generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine".
However, the highlighting of Simmel should not lead to the forgetting of the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish descent.
In general, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur are influenced by osteotomies:
The following are the most commonly reported adverse reactions:
The clinical, survey radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of the leg geometry is of central importance.
Given the diversity and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was to meta-analyze all available randomised controlled trials using dexamethasone alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis may occur in the context of a number of systemic diseases.
In some cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term by systemic immunosuppression.
Disturbances in the movement of the vertebral joints lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the disc injury occurs in more than 80% of cases on the compression side, a causal relationship must be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the space requirement for the herniated disc is even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, designed for malignant changes in the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and has a high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether organ-sparing duodenal-sparing pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure in benign pancreatic head tumours.
This operation was performed on the patients with little blood loss and almost no complications.
At a median follow-up of 3 years, 6 of 7 patients were symptom-free, and one patient who had surgery for gastrinoma had elevated gastrin levels in the late post-operative period.
Compared with the preoperative functional testing, the operation showed little impairment of endocrine and exocrine function.
Thus, in strictly indicated cases, benign tumours in the head of the pancreas can be adequately treated by duodenum-sparing pancreatic head resection, which is sufficiently radical, low in complications and without permanent impairment of exo- and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method for the treatment of symptomatic and/ or prognostically significant bradycardiac arrhythmias.
Approximately one in six patients die of sudden cardiac death following pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly due to the progression of pre-existing cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart may pose a risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Especially in advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, may trigger secondary life-threatening stimulation-related tachycardia.
Given that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved and an appropriate awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but above all safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical treatment with a curative aim, or to define those carcinogens who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are given alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (including liver and adrenal glands), abdominal ultrasound and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial cancer.
For targeted imaging, such as after thorax valve filtration, and in patients with contrast allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed in addition to or as an alternative to CT.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and Thallium-201 SPECT, the clinical relevance of which is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumours.
Methods currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic molecular MRI contrast agents or tumor receptor-based nuclear medicine methods, could play an important role in the staging of bronchial cancer in the future.
Tumor surgery in the abdomen, retroperitoneum, and pelvis may damage the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs.
Since these patients are often of sexual and reproductive age, prevention of such adverse reactions is of particular importance in tumour therapy.
Erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory problems may occur following surgical, radiotherapeutic or pharmacological treatment of various tumours.
With a thorough understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now largely preventable.
If damage to the corresponding nerve pathways cannot be avoided because of the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to curate the tumour disease, sexual dysfunction is a significant limitation of the quality of life for these patients in their sexual and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction can be treated in almost all cases by a range of therapeutic modalities.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the throat vessels at different locations of the ducts.
There is a report of a truck driver who developed atypical hepatic thrombocytopenia (HIT) after crushing both legs while receiving medicated thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
In addition to thrombosis, he had a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with elevated platelets with positive antibody to heparin:
Our first patient contact on the sixth day after the accident was diagnosed with deep leg vein thrombosis of the left lower leg and a threatening compartment syndrome also surgically split in the left lower leg.
After excluding other possible causes of these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin platelet factor-4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction that could be immediately reversed by administration of cortisone.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, otherwise termed as a characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin that occurs on the cell surface of the platelets.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the different forms of heparinallergy types I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte loss and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the second edition of the World Health Organization's (WHO) "Histological Typology of Salivary Gland Tumors" in 1991.
The first description dates back to Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumour entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumours of the salivary glands.
The parotid gland is the site of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell carcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumor extirpation with sufficient safety margin and histologically controllable tumor-free all resection margins.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma is known to have a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
The present work has developed a modified animal experimental model of renal xenotransplantation in which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs onto rats as recipients, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor portal or V. cava and ureteral drainage by splint for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of this study was to analyse the protective effect of complement modulation using soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenon grafts.
A total of 24 xenotransplantations were performed and randomized to 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/ kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was observed in the sCR1 group due to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, the control group showed histological evidence of massive platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates.
In contrast, sCR1-treated renal grafts showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombosis and reduced interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed a similar decrease in C3 deposition in the glomeruli and interstitium in the treatment group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic operations have been performed in our home on gallbladder, stomach, colon, and hernia using the voice-controlled robotic arm of the surgeon for optical guidance.
The field of vision is directly determined by the operator's commands.
All the procedures involved precise control of the robotic arm, accurate speech recognition and no technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by a single surgeon as a " solo surgery ".
In 20 more procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the operator.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The resolution of vascular complications due to DSA in renal and pancreatic transplants requires invasive intervention in mostly diabetically predisposed vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast media may exhibit nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of tuberculosis coxitis treated in collaboration with the accident surgery unit of the medical clinic at Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic approach using imaging and microbiological methods allows targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculosis chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the therapeutic outcome and discussion of the literature, the procedure presented is successful, both in terms of local remediation of the infection and in terms of functional outcome.
Atrial tachycardia significantly reduces quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Atrial electrical cardioversion is used in clinical practice, but the mechanisms underlying the procedure are not yet well understood.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using advanced optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor a disruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic AF are different from those in acute AF.
Neurological complications from clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary lesions, more frequently than secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive calcification with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
Cases of late brachial plexus lesion following clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and overlapping callus formation have been reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease and is often associated with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our studies was the determination of the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patient population of the diabetes ward of the children's clinic of the TU Dresden.
There are reports of granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of absorbable interference screws to secure a patellar tooth transplant in anterior cruciate ligament replacement, resulting in spontaneous tibial fracture.
Radiological evidence of osteolysis in the area of the internal screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign giant cells.
Primary plasmacytomas of the kidney are a major rarity.
Only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature to date.
A patient aged 64 years whose operated renal tumour was histologically shown to be a plasmacytoma is presented.
This case is the basis for a discussion of the treatment of this disease.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only in the case of renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement by the plasmacytoma is unclear.
In a multicentre, prospective clinical study of 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults were evaluated for the indication of the appropriate treatment for the fracture type.
The success of the primary treatment was assessed by establishing a practice-based score.
To date, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known to follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al. described the
[40] 5 patients with acquired striated, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We're reporting another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are striped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, no inflammatory pre-stage and no later sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
We suggest the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this condition.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be safely done as home training.
In a group training, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movements and basic knowledge of anatomy, arthrosis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviours are taught.
The efficacy of the 'knee school' as a treatment concept in arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was demonstrated in a prospective randomized trial.
The correct alignment and size of the implants is of the utmost importance for successful and permanent knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar articular section are presented.
In the Erlanger Glaucoma Study, the blue-on-yellow VEP was shown to be suitable for separating securely infected patients from securely controls.
In a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the outpatient first aid of 274 acutely injured (58%) and ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 years was first examined in terms of the timing of the calls, compliance with the deadline, age and gender distribution, severity, causes and patterns of trauma, type of acute paediatric illness, pre-hospital emergency diagnosis and therapy, and the means of transport and the target clinic, based on the emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Mainz University Orthopaedic Clinic has been investigating which disease conditions can be usefully treated with low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with disease processes.
As a basis for interpreting patient studies in haematopoietic system disorders, the age and sex-related changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow were analysed in the present study in subjects.
Therapy monitoring is not currently possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion condition due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without actual relapse avoidance are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic adverse events.
The precise validation of the method is a prerequisite for the P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm.
P-wave triggering must be carried out, and the P-wave filtering must be carried out bidirectionally or with a FIR filter.
It is highly desirable that the method be standardised.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P-wavelength from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol, as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In summary, the P-wave signalling, after optimisation of the method, allows the identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain treatment according to the current state of knowledge.
Knowledge of the genesis of pain is a prerequisite for effective pain therapy.
Most post-traumatic pain is activated by peripheral nociceptors, and the nociceptive affricates are routed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system.
Central sensitisation mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronicity of such pain.
Therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is represented by treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics are particularly important in the treatment of chronic pain.
The prescribing of these substances must comply with defined pain management standards.
Local anaesthetic blockages as a monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
In post-traumatic pain, however, a defined series of peripheral nerve blockages or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages are of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically mediated pain (SMP).
The relevance of radiation to the pelvic lymphatic drainage system in lymph node positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, additional radiation to the paraaortic lymphatic drainage system compared to radiation to the pelvic lymph nodes alone does not improve overall survival, progression-free or tumour-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term adverse reactions are available only from studies using obsolete radiation techniques.
Radiation therapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not standard therapy but is an individual choice and should be performed as part of studies (e. g. ARO 95-3).
However, due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
The following is a description of the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis and its specific forms, and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
A simple spontaneous primary or secondary pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively treated by thin-gauge drainage.
In contrast, a complicated pneumothorax is indicated by large-scale bulla drainage.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in respiratory patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
Haematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated rapidly with a drainage of the bladder and, if necessary, surgically, due to the risk of severe blood loss.
Spontaneous haematothorax also requires drainage and internal examination.
The physician in an ICU must have a thorough knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax and haematothorax.
The question of this prospective, single-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether routine PCT in intensive care patients provides additional information to the clinical finding, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology and radiology.
There is also an increased lethality, overall injury severity, likelihood of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic associated injuries.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. pelvic injury with accompanying peripheral soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip) are a special situation.
The haemodynamic stabilisation of the patient and the care of organ lesions are the main focus of interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabulum fractures are a particular challenge as are joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As these additional pathologies increase, the long-term outcome worsens.
Primary accidental cartilage damage appears to have a significant influence on the long-term outcome of acetabulum fractures.
An isolated thoracic arteriosclerosis with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused symptoms typical of aortic stenosis in a 56-year-old patient.
The case described here is notable both for the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta and for the extent of the calcification.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested a differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or a run-off aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to blood lipid regulation via the percutaneous perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
In the light of changes in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has also been called into question in recent times.
The discourse on the application and development of reproductive technologies is dominated by the experiential aspects of the persons concerned.
Many people seek help outside of medical treatment only when they are exhausted or very disappointed by unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is one of the most common locations of metastasis in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial cancers.
The decision on systemic therapy depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
In receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the first-line therapy.
Chemotherapy is indicated in patients with receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or if liver metastases are detected.
Chemotherapy should be used in the treatment of small cell bronchial carcinoma.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In metastatic non-small cell bronchial or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is more conservative and limited to younger patients and patients in reasonably good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Recent methods for the determination of bone degradation products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and treatment of paediatric back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve-end pain should be investigated.
The risk of occupational HIV infection is often subjectively considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, for example, there is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In the case of lesions with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is administered post-exposure.
There is no post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon appears to have a high success rate in detecting HCV RNA.
In preparations from a pulmonary biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive responses in both the muscularly differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation up to 5 cm in diameter in the left frontal lobe.
Polytope organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in kidney, lung and probably also in brain eventually led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international debate on assisted suicide, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to prefer physician-assisted suicide over active killing, not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the assisted suicide of a psychiatrist provides an opportunity to examine this problem from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitrogen oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive NO synthase isoforms (bNOS and ecNOS) were studied in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations, both histochemically and immunohistochemically.
Both by means of the NADPH-diaphorase-{d} reaction and immunohistochemically, differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostate gland, stroma and vessels was demonstrated.
In the obstructive hyperplasia preparations, a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation appears to be present, although due to the small number of preparations, no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out.
In the endothelial region, differential expression of NOS depending on the vascular section was also demonstrated by NADPH-d response and immunohistochemistry.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the glandular epithelium region with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional blood circulation and secretion of normal and hyperplastic prostates.
Due to the heterogeneity of patient groups and the variety of causes of ileus, the surgical indication and the choice of surgical procedure in the thin ileus are difficult to standardize.
A uniform approach to intraoperative management of the intestine (stripping, insertion of a colonic splint) and the abdominal cover (technique, suture) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small bowel complication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble surgery largely replaced by Child-Phillips complication and its variants.
In the absence of controlled studies, there are no definite indications or contraindications for plectures, long probes and other surgical procedures.
Given the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of the thin dermal layer, changing this remains an important task for the future.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive field of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results obtained by reproductive medicine and its public discussion can increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, while preventing misunderstandings.
In addition, such analysis is a valuable tool for providing reliable advice to couples in this situation.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle strength in depressed individuals have been described extensively in the clinical literature but have not been empirically studied.
We measured various gait and force parameters using simple and standardised procedures within a theoretical framework that is largely based on classical clinical observations of depression.
Twenty hospitalized depressed subjects were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gang analysis, which measured step length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace and 3-minute walk distance, and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The study was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements were seen at the end of the third week of therapy, particularly in knee and elbow extension, and in all gait parameters studied.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric issues in the present pilot study are suitable for reliable and low-impact investigation of relationships between depression and motor behaviour and can therefore be used in larger studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This may result in an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridotomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We're reporting on the results of cataract surgery for subluxation lentis and glaucoma.
The effect of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was studied in 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS).
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased plasma levels of substance P (x +/- s:
The mean mean mean plasma concentration (MPC) was approximately 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/ l in PS patients and 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/ l in N patients.
VIP plasma concentrations were not significantly different from the normal values, except for some minor deviations (x +/- s:
The mean mean plasma concentration (P< 0.005) was approximately 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/ l in PS patients and 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/ l in N patients.
We're describing two unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of multiple dysostosis and memory phenomena in lymphocytes by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.
The -L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (< 3% of normal).
The G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population to date.
Right atrial thrombi are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventricular-atrial shunt systems.
We report a 4.6-year-old girl who came to the hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
In the liquid, coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased liquid protein were detected.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the detection of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine.
This routine test produced highly positive results for ketones in the autopsies of three persons who had died clearly as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without the presence of elevated glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography showed excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/ L in all three urine samples.
A highly positive keto-diabur 5000 test with normal glucose in the urine can thus be used as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
A prospective study in 94 patients with traumatic knee arthritis is to investigate the extent to which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide guidance for therapeutic intervention.
Infantile acrolokalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in association with various infectious diseases.
In one 8-year-old girl, papules and papule vesicles erupted symmetrically on the extremities.
The viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus primary infection, whereas the serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
Jaw joint occlusion occurs as a result of trauma, joint disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the gum muscles.
The classification of dislocated jaw joints is based on the anatomical relationships of dislocated jaw joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation and discus dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
Jaw joint occlusions have been described as a complication in a number of neurological disorders.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent jaw dislocation as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocation with botulinum toxin, we are introducing the term neurogenic jaw dislocation.
Fire marks can lead to significant psychosocial distress.
The present study examined (a) the coping behaviour, quality of life and body experience of patients with fiery paint and (b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A test psychological examination was carried out on 70 patients with fiery colours as part of the flash-pulsed dye laser therapy in the areas of disease management, quality of life and body experience.
The clinical endpoint was the degree of lightening of the fire paint during the course of therapy.
Patients with fiery spots had similar levels of social anxiety to those with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the fire paint.
In terms of helplessness and anxiety-depressive mood, patients with fiery spots were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in the areas of quality of life and body experience.
The body experience is affected differentially by the management of the disease.
Since brightening during laser therapy is significantly correlated with reduced psychosocial stress, flash pulsed dye laser therapy for fire paint can also be considered effective with respect to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is a distinct disease because the biological behaviour, prognosis and treatment are different from nodal lymphoma.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of the PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas exhibit a variety of pathohistological features and a wide spectrum of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old male had a right temporal lobe nevus sebaceus from birth.
The histopathological examination revealed 2 adnexoplasms associated with the lesion:
I have a papilliferum syringocystadenoma and a trichoblastoma.
The combined appearance of these three entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on a history of heart disease (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T wave changes, Q-shaped sacs, newly occurring left femoral block) and elevated levels of the "classic cardiac enzyme" creatine kinase (CK) and CKMB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the leading causes of reversible dementia.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia in a patient over 80 years of age within a few months.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the course of the disease that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with co-existing hypothyroidism and dementia caused by hypothyroidism secondarily.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and renal artery stenosis, a left subclavian artery aneurysm close to the exit was successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graft.
The follow-up over one year showed a very good long-term result with freely perfused stent lumen and completely extinguished aneurysm.
A control CT scan showed a completely thrombosed aneurysm mass.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a separate entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.
Nevertheless, as early as the first half of the 19th century, illustrations in an atlas by Marie Nicolas Devergie can be found that almost inevitably lead to a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains, in addition to case studies of various forms of syphilitic skin diseases, individual images of gangrenous ulcers that appeared completely unexpectedly under the then common mercury therapy.
The rapidly growing ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as a side effect of this proliferating mercury therapy, as they spontaneously healed after discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and images of pyoderma gangraenosum predate the first description by over 100 years.
However, the etiology of this disease is still not sufficiently understood.
The theory of a primary bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangrenosum was thus maintained in several publications until well into the 1960s.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive function are among the main criteria for selecting anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study examines whether recovery of cognitive function is more rapid after TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/ R) than after balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/ fentanyl (S/ F).
Steady oestradiol concentrations as in the early follicular phase are achieved.
In oral oestrogen replacement therapy, oestradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment to achieve effective but highly variable levels of the active substance with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal troughs.
The high doses of oral oestrogen are necessary because of the high rate of oestrogen metabolism in the hepatic tract.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the foetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis?
We're describing an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, thin-martritis, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, and psychomotor retardation, who has a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The objectives of this study were to measure the exercise capacity of patients with cystic fibrosis and to detect exercise-related changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions and bladder tumours was to better reflect the biology of the different lesions and to make a sharper distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The relevance to diagnosis and clinical practice is critically considered in the light of current immunohistochemical findings.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms with low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
The present study attempts to establish a relationship between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammatory course of patients following cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
This is called sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant relationship between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back problems.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT finding of intravenous tumour expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI may be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindications to non-ionizing radiation contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated (not yet dialysis-required) renal failure, and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multiple) spiral CT-venography and MR-venography.
The most common childhood eye injuries are burning, burning, eyelid injury, corneal erosion, corneal foreign body, eyeball bruising, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100 000 inhabitants per year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of one-sided blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (< 5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care.
The prognosis for visual rehabilitation after eye injury is influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or gluing of the eyes for amblyopia prevention) in addition to rapid and adequate therapy.
Deficiencies and imbalances in the muscles stabilizing the spine are considered important somatic risk factors for the development of back disorders.
Therefore, the maintenance and restoration of full functioning of the muscles stabilizing the spine must be the aim of prevention and rehabilitation, along with training in coordination skills and learning spinal-appropriate behaviour.
In addition to the various pain management measures, physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including neurophysiological-based procedures, physical-balneological measures and complementary behavioural training, medical exercise therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical exercise therapy involves the application of principles and methods of practice-oriented exercise theory and exercise science within medically indicated preventive and rehabilitative measures.
The phases of the programme illustrate the different therapeutic objectives, but in particular the positive adjustment of the neuromuscular system to the rehabilitation process.
Indication and monitoring of medical exercise therapy are medical tasks.
Depending on the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, the therapeutic objectives and treatment plan are adapted in cooperation between physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The surgical indication for spinal dislocation is pain, progressive dislocation and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and in spondyloptosis, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodeal mass may occur with further progression of the glide.
The external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization now also allow the repositioning of severe slips and the restoration of a normal spinal and torso shape with justifiable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment approach is proposed which, in addition to stabilization and nerve root compression, in any case also aims at the anatomical repositioning of the lumbar vertebra.
Depending on the degree of sliding, repositioning and stabilisation should be carried out in 1, 2 or 3 operational steps.
A single dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
In grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylolysis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, selected results of which are reported in this article, is to evaluate the effects of a geriatric psychiatric centre (GZ:
The first objective of the project was to provide a first empirical examination of the process of transition from "intramural" (stationary) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical-ambulatory, i.e. home-based) regional care structures, as requested and fully justified by the expert commission of the Federal Government.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional sub-structures of care for geriatric psychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and care for the elderly (subsystem C) are analysed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ).
The study shows, with respect to subsystem A, that a GC has a significant influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selecting its clientele according to the nature and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the old-age care system (subsystem C) may be reflected in the fact that in the Gütersloh care region the rate of home placement after inpatient treatment is much lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis in the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive restricted movement in the right shoulder joint.
Ultrasound and CT scans revealed a skin and fat edema, as well as extensive fluid buildup around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitial joints and, less pronounced, in the shoulder joint.
Systemic corticosteroid therapy was rapidly successful in healing the skin lesions and in restoring the mobility of the shoulder joint.
In the case described, the involvement of structures close to the joint in eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated for the first time by modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide allows breast-support treatment in larger tumours that are not primarily suitable for breast-support treatment.
The tumor can be tracked by mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The good reproducibility and availability of mammography speak for itself.
Tumors that cannot be detected by mammography can usually be imaged by sonography.
In MRI, the tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammoparenchyma.
It also allows the detection of functional parameters. - Determination of the extent of tumour residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited by all available methods, since microscopically small invasive and especially non-invasive tumour residues are difficult to detect.
These do not recur even in the case of regression of the invasive tumour and typically show intraductal, non-invasive tumour residues.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The clinical presentation of the disease is symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and marked vegetative disturbances.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for the admission of a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
This report discusses the treatment of severe GBS in the intensive care unit, using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Stent implantation without foreskin appears to be able to immediately initiate and thus prevent a resulting dissection in morphologically suitable stenoses.
Neurosurgical therapeutic approaches to Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-way functional model has clarified the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei, making them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
Its pathological disinhibition is elicited, inter alia, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in patients with MPTP damage. - In the clinic, both lesional and restorative and stimulative procedures are currently used.
The techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy, which were already used in the past, have become more precise thanks to improved neuroradiological and physiological targeting.
The former technique is used to treat rigor, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter has been shown to be effective in treating tremor.
Only in the case of fetal cell transplantation is a new growth of dopaminergic neurons and an increase in striatal dopamine release documented;
The procedure, however, raises ethical and immunological problems.
High-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the newest technique and is characterised by reversibility and adaptability and low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei to treat tremor;
The animal experimental approach includes xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically modified cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, long-term comparative studies between the different approaches are needed to identify the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Sub-acute encephalopathy with seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol related disease, along with more common conditions such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal seizures, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic side-emphasized steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal attacks on the right side of the body with a suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed increased levels of gamma-GT and MCV.
The CT scan and the brain MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3 times the anti-convulsant therapy, seizures and worsening of the general condition were observed.
Several EEG studies showed periodic steep left parietooccipital stressed waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described is consistent with the criteria for SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinomas in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell necrosis syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, organoid necrosis or following radiotherapy are very rare (so far 86 cases in the world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortifacient of the BZNS or the result of somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage in these patients are not yet available.
There is a report of a 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the medical history nor the clinical examination indicated a genetic predisposition to basal cell carcinoma.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was conducted in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) using pelvic scalp biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to evaluate the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
The morphometric analysis allowed the calculation of significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their progenitor cells, and the fibre density.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megacaryopoeia and fibroblasts in view of the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already present in approximately 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic precursor cells, which may be related to the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, haemoglobin synthesis and degradation of the exosporated normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residues-expressing) pseudogaucher cells were detected in 30% of biopsies prior to treatment.
Furthermore, significant associations between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis could be calculated using clinical parameters such as haemoglobin levels, peripheral blood myelo- and erythromycotic normal-blast levels and splenic artery.
These variables are clearly more advanced stages of CML.
Based on our morphometric evaluation, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
This simplified histological classification was accompanied by corresponding haematological data.
Sequence biopsies in 173 patients receiving IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) monotherapy showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fibrolytic property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment are best illustrated by calculation of indices.
These included the relationship between quantitative differences in the individual variables in the repeated sampling and the time differences associated with them.
Thus, in patients with complete haematological remission following IFN administration, erythropoiesis regeneration was detected along with an increase in CD68+ macrophage counts including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups were able to detect a transition from both a granulocytic (non-formed) and megakaryocytic subtype to a myelofibrotic group in approximately 40% of patients on continuous examination.
This phenomenon was in contrast to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients receiving HU therapy, in 17 cases (36%).
In summary, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies with appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus to gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease progression.
Patients admitted in succession to a geriatric ward should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design for mental disorders.
Based on the clinical examination and the Mini-Mental State Examination (2) scores, 51 patients were considered not amenable to examination.
The remaining 74 patients were assessed clinically and using screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia has been detected or excluded by neuropsychological testing.
In 41 patients, psychiatric disorders of clinical significance (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, and in over half of these, the disorder was relevant to overall clinical treatment.
The screening instruments used have proved to be reliable and can be recommended for further use.
It remains to be seen how the treatment of the mental disorder required by this result in every fifth to sixth patient can be ensured in the setting of a geriatric ward.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis are considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
The possible disadvantages of this method are dependence on the examiner, the lack of standardization and the still relatively high cost.
The "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Centre Berlin", which is composed of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopaedists, has therefore drawn up an overview of the imaging diagnosis of sacroiliitis, which, in addition to the clinical background, also includes technical details and takes into account radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job' s syndrome, Ayub syndrome, Buckley syndrome) is a rare disorder of the immune system which may show characteristic manifestations in the CNS.
The clinical picture is characterised by recurrent urticarial exanthemas, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically significant is a marked increase in serum IgE levels, with no evidence of allergic or parasitic disease.
Therapeutically, high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment was well tolerated and well effective.
More than a year after a single treatment, the symptoms have persistently improved.
The current state of knowledge and available treatment options in hyper IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper IgE syndrome, a trial of IVIG therapy should be the first choice.
The present paper presents the results of laparoscopic floppy-nissen fundoplicatio in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding scores.
Over 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new anti-reflux operation if necessary.
Persistent but not life-threatening side effects of surgery were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required a second course of anti-reflux medication.
Laparoscopic refondoplication was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease by laparoscopic floppy-nipple fundoplication can be documented and demonstrated in the longer term not only by objective evidence but also by subjective assessment of the patient and by measurement of quality of life data.
The clinical symptomatics with neuroglucopenia are pioneering, demonstrating inadequate insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the fasting test.
Standard surgery is enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, resection.
Treatment of multiple tumours and islet cell hyperplasia, which have a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to outperform selective tumor removal.
In malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatic resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the options.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under § 216 StGB;
It is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
The various tendencies to decriminalize "killing on demand" in the Netherlands and Germany do not change this, under certain conditions.
Nutrient levels as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished from immunologically active cells of the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and a major supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in the case of seriously ill patients.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are of importance for the eutrophy of immune-competent intestinal cells, particularly as starting substances for the synthesis of NO and polyamine.
Fermentable carbohydrates are digested by bacteria in the lower intestinal tract to form mainly the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These have a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa, inter alia by improving blood flow.
Among the non-nutritive substances, the main ones are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon, as well as various growth factors, which contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental health.
The use of a diary as a measuring instrument has enabled individual assessments of situational factors influencing care and stress-promoting factors in the care process to be identified.
The results show both large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their effects on physical and mental well-being.
Talus continuation fractures are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the hip joint.
Early diagnosis allows for differentiated treatment options and thus has a significant impact on long-term outcomes.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for definitive diagnosis and indication of the therapy to be used.
Dislocated fractures treated conservatively, as far as is shown in the literature and in our own experience, lead to pain and restriction of movement and thus in the long term to arthritic reconstruction of the subtalar joint.
However, the scant literature indicates that in the case of indications for surgery, large fragments should be anatomically refixed to allow for a smooth healing.
Fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible altered joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unknown, there are a number of recent findings on the underlying pathological mechanisms and causes of the disease.
Dermal mast cell proliferation and high regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines are also detectable in non-inflamed skin and increased serum P-selectin, indicating systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect point mutations activating mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesion skin mast cells in adult indolent mastocytosis, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to popular belief, IgE-mediated allergies are rarely the cause of acute urticaria (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, food allergies (73%) and, rarely, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) are the most common causes, with long-term remissions in those who avoid (diet) or eliminate the triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly secondary and not pathogenic.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a life-threatening pattern of injury in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to illustrate the variability of possible injuries together with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
Diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which is usually treated only in trauma centres.
The three cases are presented in the chronological order of the management of polytrauma, and the differentiated possibilities of care are indicated.
Reports from previous working groups in multicenter studies with only a small number of patients show that it is problematic to identify homogeneity and thus to define it as a standard, and the current guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to the management together with the most polytraumatized and therefore life threatening patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
In 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course is known to be 2 months to 35.2 years (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found at higher T stages, and synchronous lymph node and distant metastases were more prevalent.
In the statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/ > 20%), synchronous distant metastasis (M0/ pM1, cM1) and the radicality of the intervention (R0/ R1, 2) were found to be prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a danger to adults as the peak of age shifts.
The MMR combination vaccine is an effective method of preventing this disease and its consequences.
Consistent 2-malignant MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make rubella embryopathy a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to identify indicators of healthy and satisfactory ageing in both middle and later adulthood.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and agreeableness.
In regional comparisons, personality differences were found in neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, and subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region were found for openness and in some subtests of cognitive measurement and in physician judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses are more than 80% of intra-abdominal abscesses and are mostly caused by abdominal surgery.
They are divided anatomically into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Percutaneous abscess drainage, with sonography or CT, is now a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approximately 80% when indicated.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated by intervention, while pancreatic, splenic and Crohn' s abscesses are almost always treated by surgery.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumours (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and have particular pathological, anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
Since the mid to late 1980s, different groups of researchers have tried to improve the prediction of preterm birth in preterm births by immunological diagnostics, in particular by cytokine detection.
However, the disadvantage is that prenatal diagnosis has so far been possible only from amniotic fluid, i.e. through amniocentesis, but not from the serum of pregnant women.
This is because the placental barrier for cytokines is almost impermeable, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the wide range of variation in individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts have been made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
It is possible that the detection of cytokines from the cervix of pregnant women by PCR may be a viable way forward.
The stress on the internal fixator for the spine was measured using instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest stresses were found in walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During the upper body ventral flexion, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher loads on the fixture were measured when seated than when standing.
There is therefore little reason to discourage patients whose spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally from being allowed to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand.
The additional ventral stabilisation with bone spans often significantly altered the load on the bisegmental implants.
In patients with degenerative instability in particular, it was often substantially higher after ventral stabilisation than before.
A corset or a waistcoat did not reduce the implant load.
Therefore, it is not necessary to provide patients with a corset after a mono- or bisegmental stabilisation of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningeomas are among the most common intracranial tumours in adulthood.
The term "atypical meningeoma" was added to the revised WHO classification of central nervous system tumours in 1993 to describe meningeomas with an increased recurrence rate compared to normal meningeomas.
Since the same qualitative histological criteria are used for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis seems to be fraught with uncertainty.
We looked for other parameters that are prognostically relevant:
Using the morphometrically determined core area-related Ki-67-MIB1-) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningeomas of all 3 grades (N=160) and were valid in comparison with the "recurrence-free" intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningeomas are characterised by a little structured, syncytial growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Optional features were core pleomorphy, necrosis and mitosis figures.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, in 50% of cases had a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-).
Histochemically, we have shown that in meningiomas the tissue specific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is 1p, can be used as a progression and relapse associated marker enzyme (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and may give rise to misinterpretations in the context of tumour grading, we propose that this group of relatively recurrence-prone tumours, situated between the usual and anaplastic meningeomas, be referred to as meningeomas of the intermediate type.
The joint appendage fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures due to their special anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI have greatly improved the diagnosis.
The indication for surgical treatment is for highly dislocated or luxated fractures.
The operative access is established as preauricular, sub- or perimandibular, retromandibular and oral access.
Only functionally stable methods such as the mini plate or the draw-screw should be used for fixing the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report the occurrence of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal tumors, and palmoplantar keratoses following treatment of psoriasis vulgaris with arsenic-containing Fowleri (Fowler's) liquor 30 years ago;
In addition, a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was diagnosed as a side effect.
Background and question.
Despite the importance of dermatosis in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely underrepresented in the established primary health services.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system on the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanosis heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in and out of a single acute care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL allows a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters through the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential teleangiotensin, Naevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumour in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, identify risk factors for the occurrence and evaluate the benefit of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumour manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in its acute form.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often difficult to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced adverse reactions occur in the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.
We report two cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus which were difficult to control even with high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/ azathioprine.
Both cuts were treated with IgM-enriched high dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to the immunosuppression performed.
In both cases, the initially high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) were eliminated to minimal maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained symptom-free during the 1-year follow-up period on minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observations show that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, making it one of the most common complaints in childhood.
However, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very limited in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
The use of the fluorescent dye (e.g. 365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyria and pigment changes).
In addition to detecting systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under wood light by addition of fluorescent markers has been used in the application control of topics.
Endocardial mapping is possible when haemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced by programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circuit excitation by means of stimulation maneuvers ("Entrainment-Mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In the clinical presentation and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in approximately 60-70% of cases with high frequency current catheterablation.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a recurrence is to be expected.
In the case of persistent ("incessant") ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia following implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
Currently, catheterablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapy to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
The influence of dissected lymph node counts on tumour staging and local recurrence rates was retrospectively studied in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma from 1.1.1985 to 31.12.1995 following conventional surgery and R0 resection of the tumour.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant association between the number of dissected and the number of infected lymph nodes, and with this a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes was demonstrated only for UICC Stage I and II.
In the overall and multivariate analyses, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in local recurrence rates in UICC Stage I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect but to a stage shift in the context of more accurate tumour staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically controllable factors, in particular total mesorectal excision, in the development of locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, there are no uniform standards for documenting findings.
However, these standards are necessary to allow for comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so as to meet the requirements of quality assurance in echocardiography.
Decreasing incidence of active TB in developed countries has pushed the disease out of the public consciousness.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains the most common infectious disease that causes death worldwide.
In developed countries, factors such as immigration, increasing poverty and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, especially due to the HIV epidemic, are contributing to the maintenance of a reservoir for TB.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease with subepidermal blistering and scarring, which manifests on the skin and mucous membranes.
Eye involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Although asymptomatic events have been reported in endocarditis as in other diseases (18, 19, 20, 21), no clinically asymptomatic precipitation has been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its first description is increasingly affecting areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
Firstly, there is sufficient knowledge to suggest that IL-7 is an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study using IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumour cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to be able to significantly influence the presence and growth of normal T cells and lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
The aim of this review is to outline the molecular, immunological and preclinical properties and prospects for the use of IL-7 in dermatology.
The suitability of high-dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumours was investigated and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of response to pre-operative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construction of everyday competence.
After an introductory discussion of the reasons for the increased attention paid to everyday competence in gerontology, a first part outlines six research trends relevant to everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
A third part presents an integrative approach to everyday competence, which links aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two models of everyday competence.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials have shown a decrease in local tumour control with increasing overall treatment duration of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during therapy.
Therefore, by targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation therapy, substantial advances in radiation oncology could potentially be achieved.
A brief overview discusses the possibilities for minimizing the time factor.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumour angiogenesis is of scientific interest, but its efficacy in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not been demonstrated.
The only currently safe method is to provide radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour of admission and at intervals of 4-24h for TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome.
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with CRP and TnT positive at 42 days post-discharge compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
Logistic regression with respect to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (both at 4-24h), age, sex and diagnosis, showed an independent effect of TnT (cut-off 0.1 μg/ L, p=0.048, odds ratio = 7.5) and CRP (cut-off 0.862 mg/ dL, p=0.026, odds ratio = 5.3).
Sensitivity/ specificity for the diagnosis of AMI was 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP at 1 hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP at 4-24 hours.
Highly sensitive CRP assays are of little help in the acute diagnosis of infarction in addition to troponin T.
However, the assessment of the patient' s prognosis by TnT is significantly independently supplemented and thus significantly improved by CRP 4-24h post- administration.
A 51⁄2-year-old girl with an optic glioma and resulting hydrocephalus internus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was found in the liquor and in the liquid ascites.
For the first time, a blood-liquid barrier disturbance was found to be the cause of the increased serum protein by means of serum protein electrophoresis.
Ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urethral conduction with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, in the case of hepatic injury with portal hypertension, the risk of recurrent, peripheral and transfusion-required conductive haemorrhages is increased.
While the diagnosis is simple, there are a variety of treatment options available.
The source of bleeding is usually in varicose veins in the stoma, so local sclerosis with 3% ethoxyclerol or closure of the bleeding vessel is recommended.
Resection of the varicose vein-causing conduit is an option in the event of life-threatening bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, the removal of the conduit should also be considered.
A malignant tumour must be excluded as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumour cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes - whose detection can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningeomas and gliomas are among the most genetically well characterised solid tumours:
A number of species-specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known to be associated with clinical parameters such as recurrent meningeoma degeneration or malignant astrocytoma progression.
The focal progression, typical of gliomas in particular, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumour cells, which are also iatrogenically determined by radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnoea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) for mitral stenosis III 6 years previously.
Three years later, she developed a valve thrombosis that required a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
In the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumour progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly understood.
Metastasis is a cascade of complex, interacting, single steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of cancer cells from the epithelial lining by loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumour cells is facilitated by angiogenic factors which may lead to degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, exiting the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastasis process.
Furthermore, a tumour cell will only survive entry into the circulation if it escapes the immune defence.
The systematic identification of tumour antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic interventions.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid gland, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is thought that this gene is one of the tumor suppressor genes whose allele loss triggers the development of neoplasia.
The tumours in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus may metastasize, but are generally of low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 is most commonly manifested between the ages of 20 and 35, mainly by hyperparathyroidism and/ or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have investigated the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different methods of preserving donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was problematic, as very variable follow-up intervals were summarized despite the long-known dynamic cell loss.
The aim of this study was to carry out a long-term endothelial finding at the same times, taking into account two different preservation techniques.
Patients on long-term oral anticoagulation therapy with coumarin preparations have a variable risk of perioperative thromboembolism requiring continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of coagulation inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective procedures, coumarin is discontinued for 2-3 days before surgery, and in emergency procedures, vitamin K or Fresh Frozen Plasma replacement is required.
Surgery in patients on heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic, as the effect of heparin disappears within a few hours after discontinuation.
The prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany is based on the results of various epidemiological studies.
Applying prevalence rates from recent epidemiological studies to the total population in Germany gives an estimate of 67,000-138,000 MS patients.
The very different results of epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient identification, epidemiological area and population structure.
To avoid these problems, the number of multiple sclerosis patients diagnosed was collected through a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of the possibility of clarifying the diagnosis.
The calculation and subsequent aggregation of the results of the survey of the individual groups of doctors gave a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100 000 inhabitants and is within the range of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category'suspect MS' and 170 including this diagnostic category.
The study examined how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells which then produce more growth factors in the fracture area.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be considered as a promising new technique of in situ tissue engineering, with clinical application expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by their family doctor.
The quality of the doctor-patient dialogue is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.
While in the 1970s the doctor's conversation style was considered a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversation suggest that the doctor's conversation behavior should be understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners (doctor-patient) match their conversation behavior.
Training programmes to improve basic psychosomatic competence in general practice often have little success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of the Düsseldorf training and education programme for psychosomatic primary care.
The training concept and the experience gained in this area are finally presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure are based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies and clinical intervention studies.
All these sources are only limitedly applicable to clinical practice.
Programming the speech processor of a cochlear implant (CI) in young children, specifically determining the amount of stimulation that corresponds to the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL), is often difficult.
Over-stimulation is to be avoided as this can have a traumatising effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyse intraoperatively registered stepedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered via the CI and the MAL and auditory thresholds determined at postoperative speech processor setting in 27 carriers of three different implant types.
It has been examined whether the ESR threshold is a practical, applicable, objective instrument for simplifying, refining and accelerating language processor programming.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as the percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated from the intraoperatively recorded step-dius reflex thresholds sometimes showed large deviations from the thresholds actually determined by behavioural audiometry.
Thus, a reliable and simple computational determination of the MAL and the hearing threshold was not possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold may contribute to a computational limitation of the range to be tested in addition to intraoperative functional control.
However, the exact MAL will have to be determined by another, temporary behavioural audiometric method.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red portions of a multi-colored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatosis inflammatory reaction was imposing, which could be distinguished from a true lymphoma by electron microscopy, immunohistochemical and molecular biology examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate is possibly the result of dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
The aim of the project is to provide a new diagnostic tool for the kidney using rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
A 34-year-old patient had developed a chicken-sized, skin-convex, lumpy or warty breast over 8 years in the left anterior axillary line.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic surgery, damage to the arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur.
The following four case studies describe the potential for both acute and masked complications and the treatment used.
Before and after endoprosthetic surgery, a vascular status of the extremities should be obtained.
By delusion are understood intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency to subjective certainty, which lose their alienating character as the object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations that give rise to delusion are dynamically charged according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure of actualization, which is burdensome to the imagination and is increased in psychotic constitutions, is a prerequisite for insanity.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accept them.
The case studies illustrate the reasoning behind the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion and extend it to other forms of delusion and the conditions of chronicisation.
Inflammatory pseudotumor is usually singular and is a benign tumor first described in the lung.
A case was described of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing difficulties due to a thickening of the anterior septum.
Macroscopically, a charcoal-shaped tumor was found in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed on the basis of a review of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice is a complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the present study, therefore, we present options for the examination of finger and finger-cup arteries in healthy subjects using colour-coded duplex ultrasound.
The question was whether a standardised representation of such small vessels with the colour Doppler system we used was technically possible.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all the subjects studied (n=10).
It is also shown by way of example in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that the method, with appropriate instrumentation and examination techniques, can detect pathological variations in vessels of this size.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for re-implantation of an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the operational life of the re-implanted system.
The use of new extracorporeal circulation technologies, new specialised instrumentation, and the use of intrathoracic imaging systems, allows mitral valve surgery to be performed via limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids are a group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumour-like lesions with a recurrence rate of 40%.
Trauma, endocrine, and genetic factors are all involved.
The preferred locations are the trunk and the extremity proportions near the trunk.
The combination of various imaging techniques, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumour, also reduces the number of differential diagnoses to a few.
In the past, surgical resection was a monopoly, but now more and more emphasis is being placed on adjuvant therapies, such as radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy.
In the case of a patient who has been in a coma for more than two weeks, the doctor may decide to continue the treatment for a longer period of time.
The treatment regimen for atopic eczema is continuous topical dermatological basal therapy in combination with anti-inflammatory therapy directed at exacerbations for a limited period of time.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapy is often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in case of treatment-resistant conditions.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used in microbial superinfections.
Exacerbations can often be successfully treated with phototherapy, particularly UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can generally be avoided in the treatment of atopic eczema or is only a therapeutic alternative in a few exceptional cases.
The present case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with a nasal watery discharge, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressing left-handed nasal breathing impediment to the ICU department of the Ulm Medical Centre for clarification.
Clinical examination and CT scan of the nasal cavities revealed a tumor that filled the entire left nasal cavity, apparently originating from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected by midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological examination revealed the diagnosis of a neuroma.
Based on these case studies and a review of the literature, the diagnosis and treatment of this rare nasal tumour are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment for lumbar disc prolapse.
Although statistically complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than in surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse, they sometimes lead to significant impairment.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding and transverse myelitis.
This should be taken into account in the indication of chemonucleolysis and in the education of patients.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated by cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of therapy.
Cryotherapy is an effective and minimally stressful treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative to systemic therapy with dapsone.
The effectiveness of psychosomatic-dermatological counselling was examined in greater detail for the first time in this study, based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counselling/contact services.
The extent of compliance following treatment recommendation was recorded and its relationship to possible influencing factors such as frequency of consultation, predisposition and satisfaction with consultation, and clinical and demographic characteristics were examined.
Two years after the consultation, questionnaires were sent to the medical records and the medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action, the compliance rate was 78.3%, compared to 69% in the subgroup with a recommendation for psychotherapy.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor was there any influence on the frequency of contact.
In 70.5% of cases, only one interview was conducted.
The positive attitude towards consultation and the pleasant atmosphere of conversation were the factors that helped to promote compliance.
Overall, therefore, a high level of efficiency was achieved with relatively little time and effort.
There's a report of a 29-year-old female patient with an unusual pigmentation mark on her face.
Clinically, the pigmentation lesion was consistent with naevus spilus, with histological diagnosis of multiple blue naevus, a mild lentiginous component and dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus turns out to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require much more fluid intravenously than would be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in the starling forces - particularly in vascular permeability - may play a role here, but have not been studied in detail.
The debate on the outcome of open spine surgery, particularly on surgical complications such as post-discotomy syndrome, has in the past led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, particularly for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs.
Percutaneous nucleotomy techniques are techniques based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc winding or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradical laser procedures and some endoscopic intradical surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 1970s.
The results in treating patients vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results depending on the author and the study.
It is striking that the prospective randomised trials which have comparator groups - whether conservative or surgically treated groups of patients - are very rare.
In this case, the results of intradiscal treatment procedures are more often judged more critically and with lower success rates than the sometimes retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers but cannot withstand the rigorous scientific criteria of study design.
Overall, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a subset of lumbar disc disorders, as a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At present, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are restricted to a smaller number of cases than endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their relevance to post-coronary intervention use.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
The haemostasis periods are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilisation periods of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems showed a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all documented a significant decrease in haemostasis time.
The increased well-being of patients is mainly due to the removal of the valves immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by reducing the length of hospital stays.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended that the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes be removed from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula from the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been stripping the membrana limitans interna (MLI) around the foramen from the retina for some time.
Clinical and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomised trials comparing thrombolysis and Primary dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left femoral block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, inpatient hospital stay >= 12 h or unknown inpatient hospital stay.
To describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and primary dilation, we examined data from the Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) study.
A drug addict who died five days after the first symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis in a liver coma.
Serological diagnosis showed a cure for hepatitis A, a persistence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis was not detected until postmortem).
This has resulted in prolonged (over-day) fat embolism in the pulmonary artery with consequent extravasation and deposition of fat in alveolar macrophages.
Tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 40 Alzheimer' s patients, 5 patients with dementia of other causes, and 36 cognitively unremarkable control subjects.
Of the Alzheimer' s patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total score of 25 to 28 on the mini- mental state test).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these compared to control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer' s patients, there was no quantitative association between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit as measured by SPECT.
The results suggest that tau may be elevated even in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and may be a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amycrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients with autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis, predominantly in intertriginous regions, which was ameliorated by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically imposed subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophil pustulation.
This paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restorative action remains a major problem following vascular reconstructive surgery.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodelling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenic mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival time of intimal cells, resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherotomy samples from 25 primary and 14 residual lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were analysed by TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (median cell densities:
A major finding of this study was that hypercellular restenosis showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hyposelllular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Ultrastructural studies here interestingly showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In the incidence of necrosis, there was no difference between the two platelet types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/ cell).
Thus, our data point to apoptosis rather than necrosis as the underlying form of cell death with differences between the two lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich residues.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as is commonly seen in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T-cell and natural killer cell lymphomas that may manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
The following is a detailed description of the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The current incidence of microbial (infectious) endocarditis (MI) is estimated at seven cases per 100 000 population per year and has been rising steadily for years.
The prognosis is highly dependent on rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is essential in addition to the most diagnostically pioneering clinical examination.
Cultures-negative endocarditis requires either discontinuation of inadvertently initiated antibiotic therapy and review of blood culture techniques used or the use of serological/ molecular biology techniques to identify the causative agent.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potentiating toxic effects are used.
Large (> 10 mm) mitral valve vegetation is associated with a high risk of thromboembolism and is therefore usually an independent surgical indication, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favourable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 μg/ ml.
During the first three weeks after the onset of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolism is associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolism is not a contraindication to surgery with a heart-lung machine if primary cerebral bleeding has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and the surgery is performed early before the development of a post-apoptotic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
Significant improvement in prognosis by early surgical intervention has also been demonstrated for disease progression complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially following acute valvular insufficiency), the onset of acute renal failure, abscess infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral valve, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The transvaginal ultrasound is particularly useful for studying the embryonic brain, since the large, "cyst" ventricles of the brain can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections in which either an increased or a decreased amount of fluid is found.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infectious Diseases Act will put the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
The reporting of certain suspected cases, illness or death (mainly by doctors) and the laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories) are required.
The law regulates the information which the reporting persons must provide with the report.
It also specifies which information may be forwarded by the health authority.
In particular, in the case of suspicion reports or the reporting of evidence of pathogens, not all the information required to be reported will be already available through the report, therefore the health authority has to carry out its own investigations in these cases in order to be able to provide the relevant information.
The health offices are also responsible for aggregating the reports received from doctors and laboratories and for transmitting them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose.The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form to facilitate the compilation of the data to be transmitted to the Health Office.
The transmission to the RKI is then made by the competent Landesbehörde designated by the Land.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumour cases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, nearly 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer patients usually suffer from a wide range of physical and mental disorders which, if inadequately or not adequately treated, lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the predominant symptom, with correspondingly severe effects on the patient and his or her family.
Although there are therapeutic concepts for adequate pain management from various organizations, these are often not implemented to an adequate extent.
This article therefore provides a comprehensive overview of pain management as a key pillar of palliative care.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site of essential haemostatic components and its functional role in the reticuloendothelial system, liver disease results in laboratory analytical decreases in hepatically synthesised haemostasis factors and signs of increased plasma clotting and fibrinolysis.
In compensated haemostatic disturbances, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the haemostatic disturbance.
If this labile condition is further disturbed by various noxes, bleeding with a more or less consumptive coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like constellation of findings and only exceptionally thromboembolism occur clinically.
Prevention of astigmatism induction following seamless corneal cataract surgery.
The use of medication is recommended as part of the fall prevention programme.
A random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age was used to assess the frequency of prescription of medicinal products that may increase the risk of falling by inducing dizziness.
Between the heart centers, the amount of bleeding varies up to eight times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive re-bleeding leads to increased blood transfusion rates in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
The use of allogeneic transfusions is reduced by avoiding preoperative anaemia, tolerating low haemoglobin, using autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol.
The perioperative maintenance and rapid recovery of normal body temperature significantly improves haemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent discipline at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
With perseverance and great effort, oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989.
The UEMS Section for Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to her work, by the end of the 20th century, GCM surgery was recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with some 3,800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, particularly after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, the introduction of fungi into the middle ear can cause serious complications.
It is therefore essential to rehabilitate the external auditory canal, particularly before surgery.
However, all anti-fungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous solution of miconazole.
Three comparator solutions, "E 153" (3), a complete electrolyte solution for intravenous infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical procedures on the eye, were evaluated for their potential influence on the postoperative course of inflammation following cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients were fitted with an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD).
The mean age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As a cardiac underlying condition, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was 57% ventricular tachycardia and 43% survived CPR.
A single chamber cardioverter/ defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or dual chamber cardioverter/ defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
25 patients received a subcutaneous patch or array system and 2 patients received an epicardial patch system, 92 patients received an abdominal patch and 248 patients received a pectoral patch.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in 33 patients (9.7%).
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications was three times higher in the bicameral cardioverter/ defibrillator arm at 12% compared to the single-chamber cardioverter/ defibrillator arm at 4% (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed primarily on the basis of routine radiographs, a quarter (24%) on the basis of clinical (inadequate dosing, pain) and a fifth (21%) on the basis of electrical parameters.
The efficacy of radiosynovial orthosis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint disease, particularly chronic polyarthritis, has been investigated.
Unlike conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not rotate an X-ray tube mechanically around the patient, but instead directs an electron beam to a semicircular target around the patient, which then produces the actual X-ray radiation.
This ultrafast technique has made it possible to produce axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 and 100 ms respectively and to accurately image all structures of the heart with a local resolution of < 0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial ECG-triggered section images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcium with EBT should be considered as the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for the assessment of the course of angioplasty and aortic coronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen in the assumption of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and motor artefacts, as well as superimposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcification.
Nevertheless, clinically evaluated, noninvasive imaging of coronary arteries has already been possible with EBT, and further technical advances may allow further optimization.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become established as the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established angiography procedure, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging procedure to examine this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients showed a consistent result compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic rate, corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, a post-operative adjustment to the coronary arterial current bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flow rate.
These non-invasive findings from transthoracic duplex sonography were confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularisation outcome in the postoperative setting.
In view of the increasing use of the thoracic internal artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Peripheral artery dissections are particularly common in male hypertensive patients over 60 years of age, characterised by cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying condition.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a marked rarity.
The majority of these patients are young, with or without immediate trauma in their history.
The etiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology and morphology of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed on the basis of a case of traumatic dissection of A. cerebri media in a 7-year-old girl, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The paper shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old people's homes and nursing homes.
The adaptation is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, to highlight their core competencies and to strengthen the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, but rather it is the task of the governing bodies to develop and implement country-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
A phenotypical female newborn of the 37th SSW is reported to have died on the 14th day of life from renal failure.
The child had a normal male chromosome sequence of 46 XY and an unusually severe diffuse mesangiosclosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been among the most common causes of infant morbidity and mortality in the Western industrialized countries.
While accidents in older children and adolescents occur mostly in road traffic and are consistently recorded and documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infants and toddlers, which occur predominantly in domestic activities.
In a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyse the frequency of accidental hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
There are 2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts which have been reported to cause a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint.
In both cases there was a micturition disturbance in the sense of a pollakicuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical application of this method is delayed, on the one hand, by the difficulty of image analysis, and on the other by the fact that conventional techniques can only image one layer per heartbeat.
New developments in both CT and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution of 2 mm.
As an example of such imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient coplanar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based perfusion determination for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood circulation ratios in ligament ruptures are an important parameter, especially with regard to the prospects of success of surgical care, the present work should illustrate the vascularization of the knee ligament.
The specific circulatory situation was examined by microangiography on 21 cadaveric preparations.
The proximal supply was shown to be provided by 1 or 2 major vessel trunks, which preferentially ran in the ventral band portions.
Vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularisation of the distal bands, we would recommend the reconstruction of the band by means of fibrin adhesion, which allows atraumatic recovery without the risk of vascular strangulation due to suture.
In Germany, about 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (about 75% of all cardiac operations) are operated on annually.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, predominantly the saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today saphenectomy is largely performed by continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin to open the saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders following open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every cardiac surgery post-coronary surgery and the basis for the evaluation of new minimally invasive removal techniques.
The technique presented (modified 'bridge' technique) shows desirable results, in particular a very high level of patient satisfaction with the cosmetic result and the slight limitation due to the saphenectomy wound.
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the M. pectoralis major, an ipsilateral symbrachydactyly and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, mamilla and mamma.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described to date.
We're reporting another patient with this rare combined deformity.
This study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels could predict early on the threat of sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis.
The World Wide Web (WWW) already offers a wide range of ophthalmological journals.
However, the online offerings of the various magazines and publishers vary greatly in quality and quantity.
Online publications offer many advantages over traditional publications, such as low production costs and rapid availability of information, regardless of location and time.
It can be assumed that online publications will not replace the printed versions, but will be a useful complement to the existing information supply.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had developed a rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police raid".
This case study describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aorto-enteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic prosthesis.
Preoperative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of preoperative diagnosis and the two alternative surgical therapies, in situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularisation, are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not carried out in Germany.
Opponents of PGD in Germany believe that the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents argue that under certain legal considerations, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude PGD.
In view of this situation, no PGD has been carried out in Germany so far.
The debate, which has been raging in Germany for some time, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Based on case studies, the muscle relaxant potency of Atracurium was expected to be reduced in the presence of intrathoracic pus.
A prospective clinical trial should be conducted to test this hypothesis.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unknown origin (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of more than 38.3°C for at least three days, which remains aetiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient treatment.
A quarter of these cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden defects, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
This paper presents profileometry, a modern method for determining the structure of the skin surface.
A rapidly hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area produces impressions of the skin corresponding to its negative image.
In the subsequent measurement procedure, the'stability' of the skin impression is measured with the 'profilometer' and the result is recorded as a diagram.
A statistical programme can be used to analyse, store and compare the measurement data.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after application of oestrogen-containing creams on the face.
Summary The water-serum-to-whole blood ratio is set at 1.2 in the guidelines for the forensic blood alcohol determination for the conversion of serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
In a large multicentre study of 833 cases, which is also representative of the population for which blood samples are ordered in connection with alcohol-related offences, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. In relation to the mean, the ratio deviated by less than 3% in 96% of cases.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the typical underlying constellation is venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-to-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic childhood diseases that change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A meaningful comparison of the different forms of therapy is possible only through the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
The vascular lesions were diagnosed after admission to the clinic by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity and by the Doppler signal derivation via the wrist arteries.
The emergency operations performed on all 10 children included, in the first step, the repositioning and fixation of the fragments with crossed K-wires via a line-side access.
The subsequent assessment of blood circulation revealed a pulse return (passenger, dislocation-related vascular occlusion) in 2 of the 10 children.
Eight of the ten children had no pulse, so an emergency vascular examination was necessary.
Intraoperatively, we saw 1 of 8 children with vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion.
In the case of accidental strangulation (2 of 5 children), the transfer of the pulse to the hand occurred immediately after the connective tissue was severed.
In cases of intimal lesions (3 of 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with venous patchwork.
Combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) was seen in 2 of these 8 children.
In the follow-up, wrist pulses were measured in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal by colour duplex sonography, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal via A. brachialis, A. radialis and A. ulnaris.
There was no evidence of ischemic late damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0 to 10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0 to 15 degrees) and a lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The supporting articular shaft was normal in all children when compared side by side.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to paediatricians, as pathogen culture is successful in only 30-60% of pertussis patients and results are not available for 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment option for locally advanced, deep-seated tumours.
In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400 mg RRR-tocopherol acetate/ day) against diclofenac sodium (3x50 mg/ day) was evaluated in inpatients with established chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, significant improvement in all clinical parameters studied was observed in both the vitamin E group (n=42) and the diclofenac group (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90 minutes to 68 minutes with vitamin E therapy and from 68 minutes to 30 minutes with diclofenac.
The Ritchie joint index decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac).
The grip strength increased in both the vitamin E and diclofenac groups.
There was also a significant reduction in pain severity in both groups, as measured by a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
The overall physician-patient outcome was similarly positive for both medicinal products.
In particular, in view of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the use of high doses of vitamin E may be a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they may be airy or even bloated if a fistula is present in the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is shown.
This very rare defect is usually referred to as communicating bronchopulmonary anterior anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicyst lung processes.
Diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal resection and Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly developed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l) within a few weeks as a result of intoxication with synthetic drugs (Ecstasy and Speed).
In decompensated diabetic metabolic state (HbA1c initial 11.7%), insulin injections were not given under drug influence.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate hydration when the first manifestation of ketoacidosis occurred.
The clinical picture showed peritonitis symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disturbances of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and paranoia are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Treatment included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin replacement.
The procedures were straightforward.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff-Cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation has been reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died of cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellow discoloration, grooves and cracks with swelling and subtotal fracture.
The result was a terminal prosthetic malfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
In a prospective study, 36 patients were treated with ambulatory arthroscopic therapy for talus roll osteochondrosis dissecans and monitored according to a standard protocol at 4 and 12 months.
It was found that conventional radiological examination permits a statement of the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the herd was in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, tibial perforation or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy in concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes at the anterior tibial border.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical outcome make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper hip joint.
Acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock in addition to decompensated chronic heart failure.
The former is treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, whereas the latter is already greater in pulmonary oedema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
However, the mortality rate for cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is > 85%.
In a double-blind study in 31 subjects, cognitive impairment following a single therapeutic oral dose of 15 mg midazolam was quantified using a standardized and validated test method (SKT).
The disturbances were partly consistent with the clinical picture of moderate to severe transient syndrome or organic psychosis.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia without any tendency to resolution was observed in all subjects.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident in the detection of a gross rotational stagnation which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam administration.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for imaging and clinical distribution and videoconferencing applications.
The introduction of rapid gradient systems allows very good quality representation of the extracranial carotid stream in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
The preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique allows vessels to be represented without contrast.
The use of ultrafast gradient sequencing (GES) allows for first-pass mapping of carotid arches from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s measurement time for intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed in this paper.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), the timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast-enhanced (CM) injection and the alignment of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid return of blood from the venous sinuses to the venous jugular vein should be considered.
First, the optimal time of data acquisition for the presence of KM in the arteries was determined using a model and computer simulation.
It was shown that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By gradually varying the local resolution, measurement time and CM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed in subjects and some patients, which allows the clinical use of CE-MRA in the field of extracranial carotid artery flow.
The best qualitative results were obtained using a double dose technique at an injection rate of 2 ml/ s.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further research on the optimal application of SM is still pending at a very early stage of the technology.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physical therapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include precise placement of the perforation channels including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension must be avoided at the time of tibial graft fixation.
Post-operative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, early initiation of an exercise program and regular clinical monitoring.
The clinic's experience has shown that following the above measures, the development of arthrofibrosis after surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasia, surgical treatment options have a major role to play.
The main objectives are to restore the passage, ensure secretion and reduce pain.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative therapeutic options.
This can avoid unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization in many cases.
The present paper describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition among the elderly is one of the most common and least recognised diseases in hospitals, nursing homes and home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the population studied, malnutrition prevalence is reported to be up to 60%.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as in acute or chronic illness, to energy deficiency and, combined with this, to general malnutrition.
For accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical parameters of nutrition.
These allow for tailored nutritional therapy.
The main deficiencies in the elderly are protein, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, causes enormous health costs and is associated with high mortality.
With the rapid increase in the number of elderly people, the problem of malnutrition will become more acute.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention by being taken seriously as a disease in its own right and integrated into the curriculum of training doctors and nurses.
The Cox multivariate hazard analysis identifies ELND as an independent prognostic factor alongside tumour thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumour location and sex of the tumour carrier.
In the stratification according to the above prognostic parameters, the observed survival curves according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with melanoma > 2.5 to 4 mm thick on the head, neck, chest and groin;
Men with > 1.5 - 4 mm thick melanoma of equal localization and with > 2.5 - 4 mm thick melanoma on arms, legs and abdomen (except acral and genito-anal localization).
The boundaries of the risk-benefit range can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Applicants for a driving licence are required not only to have adequate vision, but also legally to 'use it reliably'.
The nystagmus patient may do this by adopting a head-face posture or by using other compensatory mechanisms.
However, he is not allowed to do this in particular, in accordance with the applicable investigation directives (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, central retinated keratin and numerous hair follicles.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive Vellushaar cysts and steatocystoma multiplex are histopathologically distinct and therefore constitute separate disease patterns.
Bacillial angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana have been identified as potential agents by molecular biological methods.
The bacteria may be histologically represented by varthin-stary staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterised by cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules, including ulcerated nodules.
Other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen may be affected in addition to the skin.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with a BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules and bone changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in a return of all disease symptoms.
Stabilisation and spondylolysis of the ventral column were performed by thoracoscopic technique in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries.
The experience gained has made it possible to reduce the operating time considerably.
At the start of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open-label treatment.
Our own experience demonstrates the fundamental feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Significant advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for pain medication, early functional recovery and shortened inpatient stay.
Objective of the operation Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with a solid intramedullary locking pin in a non-drilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of this study was to develop a method for the improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for the assessment of acromion shape in three dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal incisions and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion form was compared to the Bigliani classification in conventional X-ray imaging.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis is used to refer to several diseases which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, the latter are not pathogenic.
In particular, the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to be recurrent, long-lasting and may additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The primary purpose of biopsy is to exclude the tumour and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There is no histological differentiation between these forms of chronic osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically ageing society, but must demonstrate its social utility under the changing conditions of age structure change.
This has led to a corresponding need for vocational guidance in practice and has triggered the search for a consensual and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
Using the direct immunofluorescence method, we were able to detect in the patient linear deposits of IgG lambda-L chains, an early component of the C1q complement, and discrete C3 deposits along the preserved elastic fibres in the dermis, particularly in the papillary stratum, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of small vessels.
In this respect, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extremely exposed to daily use and is therefore highly vulnerable to injury.
The various functions of the hand require not only vitality and sensitivity but also undisturbed motor function and stability.
In the most severe cases, only residual or replacement functions are often recovered.
The complex trauma to the hand results in combined extensive damage to the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
The aim is to provide comprehensive primary care.
The multiple damage is a major cause of extensive debridement.
The primary reconstruction of the destroyed tissue shall be carried out wherever possible.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bone or tendon, the skin coat is replaced by a sutured or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of long periods of ischemia, this approach is abandoned in so far as the blood circulation is restored first.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are summarized.
The healing outcome of a complex hand injury is any function of the hand that is regained or created.
It is therefore not reasonable to treat such a serious injury in a specialised department without the necessary knowledge and the necessary staff and local facilities.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible based on the results of 5 large randomised trials with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, the number of re-interventions is much higher according to PTCA.
In the long term, the mortality rate was lower in the surgery group in diabetic patients after the BARI study.
The individual treatment recommendation by the treating physician has also been shown to be an important factor in the patient' s prognosis.
The influence of newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomised trials.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare disease form of paraceratosis variegata, occurring after a period of 4 years following pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, is reported.
To investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these disorders from the group of parasoriasis mutations to each other and to their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases had characteristic histological changes and a predominance of lymphocytic epidermotropic T cell filtrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor within both changes could not be ascertained.
So we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case unrelated to low-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma.
A histological statement of the location of a suspected tumour lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resection margin (R0 or R1) shall be as precise and unambiguous as possible.
We report on two technical aids which we have found to be particularly useful in the case of mammalian excisates:
1) Radiopake threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
Contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anaesthetic circuits produces Compound A, which may have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers to analyse the effects of Compound A on renal function.
In total, three studies investigated the effects of 8 hours of anaesthesia in subjects at a sevoflurane concentration of 3% vol. using fresh gas flows of approximately 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from renal tubular cells in the urine of subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent investigations found either no relevant or no change in renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3% vol. of sevoflurane administered to subjects over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In any case, the experimental nature of the anaesthesia used in these studies must be taken into account when translating these results into clinical practice.
Although the topic of low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, studies in volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical studies, suggest that renal function after surgery behaves similarly to that of isoflurane under low-flow conditions.
So far, there is no published experience in the German-speaking world in the treatment of paraphilias (pedophilia, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulsive acts with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate over a 12-month study period.
During treatment, there was no further sexual aggression and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects when used in combination with other therapeutic regimens.
So we looked at five different intraoperative heat treatments for their effectiveness.
Baker and colleagues first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
The ultra-pulsed CO2 laser is a new and advanced device that has other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty by both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both methods are available throughout the country.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnosis, but duplex sonography has become more important because of its lack of invasiveness.
If it is a question of specific questions, phlebography is indispensable.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the use of the two methods is practised as a 'golden partnership' when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
The chronic rejection reaction is the most important unsolved problem in kidney transplantation today.
The aim of this study was to clarify whether reendothelialisation or reepithelialisation by extra-arenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the graft remains allogeneic.
In this context, we examined 9 graft animals of opposite sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridisation (NISH).
We used biotinillated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosomes Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and those involved in transplant vasculopathy.
Our study showed that for several years after transplantation the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are mainly composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonography detection of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Association as one of the methods for reducing the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey should be carried out to ascertain the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experience has been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision aid for the detection of brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
The question whether false positives occurred was answered with a "yes" five times.
The meeting revealed that the investigators deliberately reported borderline situations in which the conditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases was ultrasound used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a significant number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision aid in the diagnosis of brain death, mainly to further confirm the diagnosis, and less often as the only method to shorten the waiting time.
Endogenous CO formation is exclusively mediated by microsomal haemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-induced isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
The present work therefore examined the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-induced isoform of the enzyme after haemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerin leads to a conversion of crystalline lipid structures in the corneal lipids to liquid crystalline states.
It improves the hydration of the horny layer considerably, and to a much greater extent than the urea effect, especially when used in an O/W emulsion.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the stratum corneum and thus the descaling of the stratum corneum.
In the suction test, the skin deformation may be increased by glycerin, especially in the case of long-term use.
The roughness of the skin surface is also affected by the glycerin-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
Glycerine also protects against surfactants and lipophilic contaminants when used in O/W emulsions.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol causes a flow from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers the regeneration of the barrier.
Finally, glycerin, like urea, may lead to an improvement in drug penetration.
Objective of the operation Objective of the operation Stabilisation of the posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by a posterior bone block and a capsule graft.
Long-term complications resulting from venous graft degeneration can be reduced by this surgical procedure.
Due to the extended operation times and increased operative trauma associated with the use of multiple arterial grafts, these have only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration) and we are pleased to announce that the results of this study are now available.
Materials and methods:
Between March 1996 and July 1999, 405 patients with coronary artery disease were completely revascularized at our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic internal artery, in 299 patients (73.8%) thoracic internal artery and radial artery and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in T configuration.
The mean number of coronary vessels anastomosed per patient was 4.1 +/- 0.9.
The hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
There were no complications after radial artery removal except for temporary paresthesia.
In the angiographic control at 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary artery stenosis-free cases were > 50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allows its routine use.
The different treatment modalities for periprosthetic femoral fracture following knee replacement endoprosthetic joint replacement are discussed.
A new method of supplying such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
Measurement of intracranial pressure has acquired a key position within neuromonitoring, although the brain pressure does not allow the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron to be recorded directly and only temporarily delayed.
Reliable measurement of cerebral pressure is dependent on specific properties of cerebral pressure probes, which are to be investigated below.
The aim is to analyse and categorize these from a measurement perspective in order to gain a better understanding of their different functions and measurement characteristics.
Partial sphincterctomy is practiced in our cataract surgery for very narrow pupils (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosing ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While research on health-related quality of life in adults is increasing, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents is only recently being addressed.
This paper evaluates the literature on the subject of health-related quality of life in children in terms of research priorities and methods.
The overview shows that empirical work is rare so far, and the existing measuring instruments for the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are necessary to be able to use the recording of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were enrolled during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared to a control group.
Due to skin changes that, based on the biographical material presented, must be considered as beginning rhinophymia, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasion in 1957.
Throughout his artistic career, the artist has been involved in aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the area of the nose.
As a pioneer of pop art, Warhol's body of work has significantly shaped modern society and, in doing so, has also influenced our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the HepaVision programme (MEVIS, Bremen), developed specifically for 3D liver imaging, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and live liver donations.
Experience with the programme has been gained for > 50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT studies.
After active nonspecific immunotherapy had a positive adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves a gene transfer that can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, the following are suitable:
Vaccination with tumour specific HLA-associated antigens by peptide or naked DNA, vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, or in vivo transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of biases (" defenses ") in some patients on the evaluation of treatment outcomes has not been accurately assessed.
In 309 inpatients treated with talk therapy and followed up one year later, the extent to which raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales are influenced by patient defences measured by validity scales of the MMPI-K, FPI-R and casting personality tests is shown:
The tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability") and the tendency to appear inconspicuously normal.
Their relative improvements (impact rating scales) decrease as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient talk therapy strengthened the defenses in aggravating patients and reduced them in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequently timely, deformity-specific, surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot, approximately 25% of recurrent and treatable residual deformities are reported.
The main cause appears to be the lack of concentric reposition and subsequent retention of the sub-articular complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
Based on the experience of 94 recurrent/ residual clubfoot operations (patients < 10 years), the age-related surgical procedure is presented.
After the age of 8 to 10, median osteotomies, Ilizarov correction with the external fixator and triple arthrodesis are used as the ultimate ratio.
The cell walls of the nevus show marked variability in their clinical morphology.
We're reporting a 77-year-old female patient with a hardened, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on her torso.
For this grape-shaped appearance we suggest the term "corymbiform nerve".
For ethical and socioeconomic reasons (explosion of costs in transfusion, individual fate of patients), the development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine is a challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion doctors.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anaesthesia method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and automatic autologous wound blood transfusion, allows patients with large intraoperative blood losses to avoid transfusion of allogeneic blood.
Professor Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Maternity Hospital and the Midwives' Training Institute, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He focused his research and teaching on the empirically feasible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as a midwife.
Determining the size of the pelvis and inspecting the Michaelis tube named after him gave him a reliable prognosis of risks of the birth process.
His research was characterized by honesty and conscientiousness:
He self-critically published medical failures, critically tested new theories.
Thus, he was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis's doctrine on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
In despair over the deaths of many of his patients in childbirth, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumour may be responsible for a long-known AV block and sudden death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can produce temporary stimulus effects in human beings in defined areas of the cortex.
New applications for functional-anatomical issues of language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and prior experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations on safety are given.
Neurinomas of the N. facialis are rare, benign tumors that occur mostly in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow to extratemporal and then are noticed extracranially as space requirements.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial paralysis.
The patient had diffuse dizziness, progressive left-side noise-sensing disorder and mild peripheral facial paralysis without deficit of tear secretion.
The neuroma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The tumour was removed by an extradural middle fossa approach without injury to the motor N. facialis.
This is the first report of an isolated neuroma of N. petrosus major without affect to the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) is when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, with phenytoin and phenobarbital used if unsuccessful.
The treatment-refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialised intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the best course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are active substances that may be used as alternatives.
For the treatment of an obsolete rupture of the tendon of the tibialis anterior, either a tendon transplantation or a tendon transplantation is recommended.
A case study describes the operative treatment with augmented reversal plasticity;
Three years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively free of complaints with good functional outcome.
The advantage of reverse plastic surgery is that, compared with the operations described so far, there is no loss of function.
Analysis of sympathetic-vaginal balance provides valuable information on prognosis and treatment strategies for many disease states.
The main methods used to measure this parameter in intensive care patients are the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well defined and tested in large prospective studies.
In contrast, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognoses of chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the meaningfulness of these disease pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, as conditions of particular relevance to intensive care, are also associated with impairment of autonomic function, as measured by reduction in heart rate variability.
The reduction in heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be gaining increasing appeal in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report three patients with acquired green discoloration of the scalp.
The medical history showed that all three patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
The hair was examined by atomic emission spectroscopy and found to be excessively coppery, causing the green colour.
Our observations suggest a characteristic link between this exogenous hair colouration and the absorption of copper by the swimming water of indoor swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjective assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, global quality of life assessment, Munich quality of life dimension list (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx.
The individual measurements were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of patients with terminal heart failure rated their quality of life as very poor;
The results of the study showed that the quality of life of the patients was improved by 6 weeks post-operatively, with 74% of the transplant recipients reporting a very good to excellent quality of life.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and health (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients reporting a high level of satisfaction with their health and 51% with their physical performance.
Although patients rated their mental health as good prior to HTx, this parameter improved post-operatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (pre-op).
The range (R) is 3.78 versus 12 months.
Quality of life was best correlated with health status prior to HTx (r=0.61, p< 0.01), and 6 months post-transplant with satisfaction with health status (r=0.76, p< 0.01).
The areas of sexuality, occupational situation and leisure planning improved after HTx in only about 28% of patients.
90% of the patients had one or more complaints after the transplant, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, all areas of quality of life except mental health significantly improve as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite high expectations and post-operative discomfort, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their life situation after surgery.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) following a bicycle accident, with a skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and contusion bleeding [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-demanding hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP levels required barbiturate coma for over 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic pulmonary failure on the 8th day after the trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could be transferred to neurorehabilitation only 57 days after the accident.
In the subsequent period, the patient developed a massive reduction in mobility in both hip joints (extension/ flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction and adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
The pelvic examination and CT scan showed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV).
The HO were removed twice in the two years following the accident, each time via a Smith-Petersen access.
HO relapse prophylaxis was achieved by a single preoperative radiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/ day) over 3 months.
The total movement at the hip joints is 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after the resection as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
The following procedures shall be used:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiology has not shown any recurrence of the disease.
The patient can continue to work in light agricultural activities for 3 years after the accident.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection system for dermatophytes has been developed.
The "TR1" and "TR2" primers flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that codes for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
The DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, as well as that of some yeasts and molds, could be amplified by PCR.
Hybridisation with specific detection oligonucleotides led to the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the demarcation of the dermatophytes from the yeast and mould fungi.
The specificity of the PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermal and epidermal samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely collected skin and nail samples were analysed by PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected by PCR in 35 and by culture in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples.
The sensitivity of the PCR (92%) was higher than that of the culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
Wrist carthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
Wrist carthroscopy is crucial in this regard, alongside functional radiology procedures.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and the scapulohumeral ligament are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly used in forensic practice, archaeology, and in evolutionary and population genetic studies during the last decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA is described, with special attention to the non-coding hypervariable regions.
The importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biology studies is also discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their size and structure are explained.
The results of experimental work aimed at extracting mitochondrial DNA from ground-deposited teeth, hair follicles and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three cases of trace which have been resolved by mtDNA analysis are presented.
The aim of the present work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as own observations.
Microperimetric studies following surgical extraction of chorioid neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma is formed in the area of the resulting pigment epithelium loss.
The operative effort should be weighed against the potential functional outcomes of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging intraarticular structures and surrounding soft tissue of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for the diagnosis of labyrinth lesions of the hip joint.
The MRI of the hip joint allows direct imaging of labyrinth lesions by means of joint space distention and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow assessment in the critical craniocentral sections.
Labrum lesions can be classified into different clinically relevant stages using the MRA.
In addition, the presentation of concomitant lesions (intra- and extra-osseous ganglia, stressed edema) is possible.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
So far, there have been no complications from the more than 100 arthrographies that have been performed.
Based on this experience, MRA is the method of choice for the diagnostic imaging of labrum lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we have used.
It was found that the wall of varicose veins was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, including the vein wall below a still intact vein valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
The combination of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results does not confirm the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose vein formation, but rather that the first change in the vein wall and thus valve failure occur.
Artery injury as a direct result of trauma usually results in bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, the acute ischemia may be absent.
Hypotenar-hammer syndrome is a closure of the distal A. ulnaris as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually insidious and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to diagnosis.
There are no proven therapeutic recommendations.
The diagnosis of ulnar artery occlusion as a result of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the medium-term eye pressure regulation following combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthesia initiation and maintenance with propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anaesthetic agents or techniques.
This article will show how to take advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The potential effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are discussed using clinical and basic research findings.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
Prediction of postoperative soft palate aesthetics following combined maxillofacial prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw by a repositioning osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants is rarely included in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, 23 patients were selected for treatment by medical rapid prototyping of the facial skull and soft tissue profile projection using video imaging, with special attention to frontal dentition.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/ or prosthetic treatment regimen was modified due to preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results obtained.
Profile prediction with video imaging is a useful decision aid in planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw to take into account the interacting factors - extent of maxillary displacement, direction of insertion of enossal implants and type of supra-construction.
There are reports of a large-bone multi-centred juvenile xanthogranuloma whose unusual clinical and histological aspect initially prevented diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change of the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, as well as the lack of evidence of specific cell organelles, could confirm the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations are among the medicinal products offered on the German market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings on Thymus products are based on case reports, studies with flawed and in some cases ethically questionable design, and studies that do not allow a scientifically sound conclusion due to the short duration of the studies and the small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapeutic recommendation for thymus preparations in rheumatic diseases (e. g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be derived on this basis with sufficient positive benefit-risk assessment in accordance with the state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of A. hepatica dextra in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding had progressed to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to identify in the condition after Billroth-II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising treatment option.
Studies of the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are detected early and treatment is initiated within 3 hours of the onset of the first symptoms.
Precious time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or minimized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number is to be achieved by intensified training measures which take into account both the public and the emergency medical personnel.
The standard of care in acute care includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and treatment of hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia.
In the maintenance treatment with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine tablets was compared with oral methadone in 40 opioid-dependent patients over a 24-week study period.
In the randomised trial, retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the study programme for the entire study period and completed it as planned), supplementation and duration of stay were defined as the target parameters.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a trend in the retention rate (p=0.06) in favour of the methadone group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine group (n=20) was tendentially higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone group (n=20).
There was no significant difference between the two in terms of the additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine over the course of treatment.
Methadone was the more successful substance in the study in terms of duration of stay (p=0.04).
How important and meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional failure following radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the likelihood of haematogenous metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined for clinical parameters, reflexothalgia, predominant tumor growth structure, T-category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
Twenty-nine patients received concomitant chemotherapy, and the remaining patients received placebo.
In 25/139 patients, radical neck dissection was performed following completion of radiotherapy as per the treatment regimen.
10/139 patients were subsequently treated with an operation called " rattrappage ".
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%) cases, the disease was locoregionally controlled.
Tumor was not controlled in 62/ 139 patients (45%).
The two groups of patients, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumours, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, sex, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and number of concurrent chemotherapy cycles.
The tumour control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexothalgia (p < 0.0078), growth pattern (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time for patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/ 62) of locally uncontrolled patients, compared to only 4/77 (5%) of locally cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, plateaued after 24 months.
Locoregional tumour control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indicator of the likelihood of distant metastasis.
Failure of therapy is due to the biological aggressiveness of the tumour.
The introduction of multi-domain detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice is bringing a new dimension to the volume and spatial and temporal resolution in CT.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of investigation strategies to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 and 3 own case studies were evaluated for symptomatics and current therapy of viper bite (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of some threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning for more than 2-3 hours after the event, the likelihood of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of knee distal stretch reconstructive and reparative procedures.
The MPT fixture was fitted in 44 patients in mounting A and in 23 patients in mounting B.
Four patients developed deep infection, two of which were caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients who completed the MPT-Fixateur wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
Follow-up included 5 patients with partial patellectomy and transverse patellar ligament repair in caudal fracture and 12 patients with transverse patellar ligament suture repair in lower patellar tear and protrusion or patellar ligament suture repair in intraligament rupture who had no knee joint care other than stretch-operation.
The IKDC score was assessed as normal in 2 patients, almost normal in 10 patients and abnormal in 4 patients.
Iso-kinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a 10-20% reduction in the strength of the stretch muscles in the operated leg compared to the opposite side.
In summary, the EPTT with the MPT-Fixateur has proved its worth in the context of continuity restoration procedures on the distal stretch apparatus of the knee joint and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial dislocation with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic disorders of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
The development of new diagnostic tools and algorithms is now making it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies whose usefulness has been investigated in clinical trials.
The case history of a 6-year-old boy is used to illustrate the presence of Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure and possibly involving the eyes in children.
In areas exposed to light, numerous haemorrhagic blisters appear acutely at the beginning of the bright season, recurring until adulthood, which heal scarring.
In a field test, we gained experience in using the MEDICUS tele-radiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynaecology.
The central type of imaging in the X-ray diagnostics of oral, maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic layer imaging.
The reduction in dose requirements has been further facilitated by advances in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or memory foils.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional imaging methods make computed tomography and nuclear spectroscopy indispensable for many clinical problems in oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery.
Although the primary use of nuclear spectroscopy is for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows changes in the cortical area to be imaged, due to the reduction in measurement times.
For certain problems, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures allow for functional analysis with imaging support.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is now used in hospital and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients with reduced body awareness, limited emotionality or difficulty in verbal psychotherapy due to personality conflicts.
The most common methods used today are briefly illustrated and other methods are mentioned.
The link between the affects and the vegetative and voluntary nervous system, and the close connection between mental and physical processes, especially at the beginning of life, which is linked to the form of interaction experienced and has psychobiological effects, are mentioned as influencing factors.
In the further development of the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important for the therapy.
The relationship between body-oriented methods and verbal psychotherapy, especially psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Empirical research approaches are highlighted.
Psychotherapists live in a tension between family ideals and reality, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic work leaves the individual a great deal of latitude in finding a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for women psychotherapists, to create a family model suitable for them and their partners.
Three models are presented and described in their effects.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic work on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should give equal consideration to their personal relationships with patients in their training and further training.
The prevalence of advanced heart failure is increasing in the cardiovascular population, with a prevalence of 0.1%.
The 6- to 12-month survival rate is significantly reduced at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice in drug-induced refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have been developed.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anti-congestive beta-blockers.
Surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded by the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assisted hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plasticity, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These treatment options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium to long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The selection of patients suitable for the treatment depends crucially on the success of the treatment.
This requires the compilation of risk scores based on national and international patient registries.
The example of a 30-bed unit at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Bochum compares the number of TLA procedures with manual therapeutic procedures over a period of one year.
In contrast, 122 manual therapeutic operations were carried out on HWS, BWS and LWS by the respective station doctors with completed training.
While TLA focused on the main site of predilection of the disease (pseudoradicular HWS and LWS syndromes), manual therapy was primarily related to adverse events on other spinal days in patients with these diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated mandible tooth from its implantation site to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
This case report presents the case of the migration of a retinated lower premolar to the processus muscularis, documented over a period of 14 years.
Migration along the ascending mandibular shaft to the muscle continuum occurred after the completion of root growth, after the patient's 20th year.
There was no radiological or clinical evidence of any specific cause for this patient to have wandered so extensively.
The incidence of prostate cancer and of cases curable by radical prostate cytoelectomy is increasing.
The detailed pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis and the further clinical procedure.
The lack of a standardised method for processing the preparations at international level makes it difficult to compare different scientific studies.
The well-defined, rational assessment of preparations we propose is intended to remedy these problems and to help improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The rapid increase in documentation requirements, performance recording, cost effectiveness and quality control require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
In the Orthopaedic Clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen, a client-server-based operating planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992 and has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, special consideration has been given to the clinical and scientific requirements of the clinician.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, operational planning (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), operational documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinical communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
By simultaneously integrating the WEB server into MedXS, content and functions can be accessed from the intranet or the Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
The application has made clinical procedures much easier and has improved budgetary negotiations with the health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterised by nonspecific neurological symptoms and, in particular, facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leucodermias (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered to be relatively typical and usually indicative.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a significant cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially in young patients.
The main focus of therapy is on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prevention of sudden cardiac death.
In some patients with severe and progressive ARVCM, there is evidence of cardiac failure, which is treated with medication according to standard therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) is a new method by which a tumour can be examined for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of the need for patella replacement in knee replacement is still very controversial in general.
In this context, we need to obtain more information on the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just in comparison to the prosthetically supported patella.
The fact that we have been performing patella replacement for almost five years only in special cases has given us a patient stock on which this question can be studied.
We used 30 fully prosthetic knees with a two-year follow-up to perform a targeted survey of the patellar ligament and tendon, first on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar slipped base, and correlated the results with the range of motion and persistent pain symptoms after 2 years.
The bone patella has been regularly adapted to the prosthetic joint with the edge bone contact zone compacted with or without a fibrous place holder;
7 patients were classified as " residual problem group" based on their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/ extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were there cases of post-operative shift greater than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases of post-operative tilt greater than 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, also with significant differences from the non-problem group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility correlated with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap (16 mm/39 degree) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After axis-correcting replacement of the tibial components, this patient also became free of complaints and well mobile without any surgical intervention on the patella and although a considerable residual stiffness remained.
The conclusion is therefore that a greater effort is justified for centring to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm:
In addition to the usual surgical procedures for implantation, which have a beneficial effect on the development of the kneecap, high quadriceps displacement or medial refixation of the detached tuberosity may be required.
On the other hand, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, as the non-prosthetically supplied patella has an amazing adaptability to the prosthetic joint by remodelling bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases of severe preoperative dislocation, where we had not replaced because of good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more delayed problems even with normalized knee discs.
Whether there is an extended indication for patella replacement in such cases remains to be determined.
The quality assurance programme of the VDR and the quality assurance publications of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
The introduction of a comprehensive quality management system in a rehabilitation clinic has led to measurable improvements in quality.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinical structures.
The focus has been on measures relating to patient needs and the development of internal treatment processes.
To increase employee satisfaction and skills, rehabilitation-specific training courses were conducted.
New forward-looking perspectives have been developed with other partners.
Objective of the operation Avoid or remove compression on the nerve structures.
This paper provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that in onocytic cells of the parathyroid gland and also of the liver, respiratory chain defects are more frequent in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unknown.
It is expected that oncocytic metaplasia is pathogenetically different from oncocytic neoplasia.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasia.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly found in the thyroid, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient on prolonged parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes in this patient are due to a deficiency of zinc in the body.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with eczema and a skin-healthy sample of 52 subjects are compared with regard to their sexual behaviour.
The test method used was a questionnaire on sexual behaviour according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership.
The skin patients studied differ significantly from those with healthy skin in the sense of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of affection is reduced in both sexes, and the ability to orgasm is significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatic patients are more affected than patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been discussed by their treating physician about their sex life.
The problem of the intimacy of the skin is not new, but the doctor of dermatology and venereology should be a competent interlocutor on questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
The conventional X-ray image must still be considered as a basic examination in the clinical question of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential not only covers bone inflammatory destructions, but also allows their current activity to be assessed.
Furthermore, the collateral phenomena of the X-ray may indicate a clinical thrust situation and directly and indirectly show the inflammatory increase in volume of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular by providing detailed images of cortical bone structures - complementary to MRI - provides highly specific information on some specific issues, in particular on the skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis, partly also for operational planning.
This applies, inter alia, to the cruciate, sternoclavicular and upper HWS joints.
The treatment of open fractures of the lower leg of the second and third degree with simultaneous soft tissue damage now includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the unbored nail, to the primary bone reduction with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of the soft cover.
It is only through the successes achieved in this field that it has been possible in recent decades to reduce significantly the high rate of amputations and infections that had previously been incurred.
Initially, these were isolated cases, but there was increasing evidence that these patients had tendon problems in the lower leg, ranging from recurrent swelling to ulceration.
A clinical study using venous occlusion plethysmography in 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy subjects showed that more than 50% of all patients suffered clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage ranges from simple swelling to ulceration of the cruris, and its clinical relevance increases with the distance from the accident.
To prevent further damage, including iatrogenic damage, strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Objective Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of limb form and function.
Muzines are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a variety of carbohydrate and/or peptide sequences of antigenic determinants.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry has provided extensive knowledge of their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues have been described.
A number of recent findings also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumour biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
This paper provides an overview of gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including its own findings.
The establishment of rheumatology centres in Germany has in recent years made it possible to link the outpatient and inpatient areas with the resident general practitioners, internal medicine and orthopaedic rheumatologists, patient gymnasts, occupational therapists and psychologists, as well as the acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatology focal points can contribute in the long term to further improve the cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatic patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic patients in terms of quantitative and qualitative comprehensive rheumatology quality management.
Despite the increasing incidence of medical problems, knowledge of the nature and frequency of treatment errors following thyroid surgery is limited.
The analysis of a collective of 21 515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the Medical Chambers of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the period under review.
In 36 cases (16%) the expert committees found errors in the treatment.
The complaint concerned 95% of surgeons, 2% of anaesthetists, 3% of both disciplines and once an ENT doctor.
Of the complaints, 90% were related to complications following routine thyroid surgery.
Surgical-type complications such as recurrence spares (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), post-operative haemorrhage (3%) and late recurrence (1%) together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), residual nodules (4%), and scarring problems (5%) accounted for 37% of complaints but 70% of treatment errors.
In only 11% of the treatment errors identified, there were deficiencies in the provision of information.
Treatment error was particularly common when reoperation was required (p < 0.001), when the goal of the operation was not achieved (p < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by a failure in the follow-up (p < 0.001).
The Environment and Health field is characterised by its interdisciplinary nature and the resulting high communication requirements.
The problem is compounded by the fact that sometimes there are considerable problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this field.
Recognised indications are bilateral renal tumours, renal tumours in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys, and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis following tumour nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Improvements in surgical strategy, such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery, may also save patients with multiple and advanced renal tumours over 95% from nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-sparing renal tumour surgery in imperative indications, an increasing number of centres are recommending the extension of parenchymal-sparing renal tumour surgery to a selected patient population with contralaterally healthy kidneys (selective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinoma of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears to be small.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrence is in most cases infaustous.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has been most commonly described in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or cervical uterine carcinoid.
Background and question.
The pathogenicity and resistance status of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases were assessed to develop rational treatment guidelines.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognised standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective, but it is also very low in side effects.
The following is a case report of a patient who experienced severe, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in healed psoriatic lesions during this combination therapy.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
Several different lithotriptors have been developed, using largely the same technical principles.
The current discussion is about the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the likelihood of recurrence, which further make appropriate metaphylaxis useful.
While side effects are known and quantifiable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in conjunction with other therapies are still pending.
Acute corneal calcification has been observed in clinical isolated cases following treatment of a fibrin response in the anterior part of the eye with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).
The pathomechanism, which was previously unknown, led us to the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy following in vitro fertilisation (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case study, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
The Commission is also considering the possibility of a new system of national aid.
The AB0 blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
Using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and represented on a polyacrylamide gel by silver staining after restriction digestion.
The following allele frequencies were found in a population group in southwestern Germany:
The following are the most commonly used methods of testing:
In 10 of 280 subjects (3.57%) the method of analysis chosen here, which only takes into account the nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and O2 alleles is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic examination.
The following case studies are intended to demonstrate that exceptions must be made.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patella facette after a football game.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, knobby, connective-tissue-converted haematoma which could be easily removed by a hollow:
Apparently, the football game had caused a hemorrhage from a bruise or a patellar subluxation.
The boy was fine after the arthroscopy, the muscle atrophy was rapidly reversed.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and sustained effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data suggesting a longer term effect (more than one year) are presented.
Recent studies clearly demonstrate a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammatory activity from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insight into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are loosely linked by the underlying causes of RA but develop to some extent independently of each other.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids might relate to different mechanisms, as presented elsewhere in this symposium.
Ejaculating sperm and spermatogenesis cells express chains of 1, 3, and 4 integrins and their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show marked intra- and interindividual variation and different locations on the surface of the sperm.
The 'nested' polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To date, it is unclear whether AMs have functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells, or whether they are merely 'biological redundancy' or just the final insurance.
The marking of sperm AM was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in the seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a multi-spectrum hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors.
The secretion of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an evening rise and night peak between 2 and 4 a. m.
In addition, independent of a receptor system, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in both extra- and intracellular space due to its strong lipophilic properties.
The affinity to the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, melatonin has been shown to have a promising potential in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
Another aspect is the effect of melatonin on hair growth.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
Some knowledge is available on the dermal penetration and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals which allow the localization of an inflammatory focus in case of unclear focus, given the possibility of whole body imaging and SPECT technique, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals which allow the proof of, for example, leukocyte infiltration.
Both approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus or which involve inflammatory scintigraphy in case of unclear finding.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treatment for infant capillary haemangiomas.
However, surprisingly, there are no detailed studies to demonstrate its effectiveness in the tumors that regularly undergo spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial space requirements due to post-traumatic bleeding and oedema, and the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
In both isolated SHT and post-poly trauma with and without brain damage, a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators may lead to mono- or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and dysfunction are usually survivable, but in combination and cumulation, they can be fatal.
Hypermetabolism after SHT is also understood as CNS interactions with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
The effects of an SHT on the rest of the body are contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries of a polytraumatised victim on brain function, whereby shock-induced perfusion disorders may cause prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood clotting, metabolism, and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bi-directional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the therapeutic measures currently used, is still insufficient and needs further clarification.
Finally, it is from this point of view that the choice of the right timing for secondary interventions, which are not directly life-saving and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the trauma of the operation, must be reconsidered.
This paper attempts to summarise important aspects in this field.
The molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human kalicrein 2 (hK2) have proved to be valuable decision-making tools for better differentiating between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, as well as for early detection of prostate cancer.
Children with facial cleft have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy-drop-outs were compared with 599 adults and examined for marked personality characteristics.
They were also asked by questionnaire to give their personal reasons for leaving.
Erythroceratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin is a hereditary dermatosis with partial cirrhosis of the skin, predominantly in families from the Oudtshoorn district of South Africa.
The seasonal link to the winter semesters and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We're demonstrating clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings from a four-year-old patient that are well-suited to erythroceratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area were not to be found.
17 Studies on the efficacy of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondyloarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), and localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the work reviewed reveals clear deficiencies.
The aim of this study was to examine whether visual acuity decreases with the time of performance and whether these regulations disadvantage normal persons and nystagmus patients in the driving assessment.
Sudeck syndrome affects a limb after micro-trauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to injury or surgery to a limb.
His theory was not accepted, since most of the medical profession believes that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental studies and also studied the effects of antiflogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
This paper describes methods for the application of rapid multilayer spiral CT for cardiac imaging by means of ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition.
Computed tomography, in addition to the radiological examination methods used in dentistry, allows a layer-free representation of the upper and lower jaws.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proven itself in other issues.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jaw bone and the damage caused by the retinated teeth to permanent teeth can be assessed, allowing early treatment.
If the periodontal fissure of the retinated tooth can be delineated, orthodontic placement is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone loss should be accurately determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space requirements can be detected by CT.
Prior to an intended implantological treatment, therapy can be optimized by careful consideration of the remaining bone matter and the position of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants may be specified.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
The symptoms of SE are described by case examples.
The main symptom is a loss of consciousness to coma.
Cranial CT scans are also usually normal, and generalized brain oedema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the magnitude of which is correlated with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products and bacteremia itself are important etiological factors.
Because of a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain has changed.
A variety of other factors, such as electrolyte displacement, hyperthermia, hypoglycaemia, shock and ischemia, and liver and kidney failure, may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate therapy of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE is of particular diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general disease and reduced general condition has a very poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy.
Movies tell stories, you know.
The most exciting scenes are those in which people are faced with conflicts of decision.
Medical ethics conflicts are not only found in medical series or disease presentations, but often in genres where this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance, crime and gangster films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films are drawing on moral values and are seismographs for the societal relevance of medical ethics issues.
However, in the film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical ethics case review and is a useful complement to the teaching of analytical and communication skills.
The reduction in restenoserate compared to conventional PTCA has led to stent implantation becoming the most common initial intervention.
This is why in-stent restenosis - especially the long-term form - is a major clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty in these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
Preclinical management of amputation injuries is a major challenge for the emergency services.
The initial care of the amputee in the event of amputation injuries is often the decisive factor in the success of the rehabilitation measures, along with the initial care of the injured person.
The primary objective of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
Therefore, it is a general rule that the diagnostic imaging of the larynx should be carried out in the knowledge of the results of the endoscopic diagnosis.
The topographical and anatomical conditions of the skeleton, internal structures and the surroundings of the larynx will be synoptically represented.
Transpedicular stabilization with a screw ring system eliminated instability while maintaining segmental function.
In recent years, new insights have been gained into post-traumatic changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in the management of neuropsychiatric intensive care, this has led to the development of drugs to reduce the incidence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
This work will address the new knowledge of pathophysiological changes after SHT and the main pharmacological options for intervention.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in varyingly advanced experimental and clinical trials.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with a progressive course of disease are a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trophosphamide on the disease course of treated melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for pulmonary silicosis for over 3 years before developing asymptomatic black spots on his face.
The other patient developed gray-black patches on both lower legs due to folliculitis after only 6 months of taking minocycline.
A trial treatment with the Rubin laser resulted in a return of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The different clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed in the case studies.
Objective of the operation Removal of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have in recent years led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
A key factor is the recovery of neural capabilities.
In this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the N. alveolaris inferior was investigated after tumour surgical partial resection and reconstruction with the vascularized N. thoracicus longus.
Sensation of pressure and pain was felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration as early as 5 months, and thermal stimuli as early as 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly stimulated N. thoracicus longus is therefore a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in tumour patients.
The use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of intentional overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, although a relatively small number of overdoses result in serious complications.
Severe liver toxicity should be expected in any patient who has exceeded the standard dose and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/ kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a patient weighing 60 kg).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, any patient whose degree or timing of overdose is unknown should be given a complete course of N-acetylcysteine, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be continued if liver function deteriorates.
Specialist advice should be sought at the first signs of severe hepatotoxicity to ensure optimal therapy or prompt transfer in the event of acute hepatic failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has considerably improved the lot of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made by closer cooperation between the hospitals that admit patients and the specialised liver disease facilities.
Background and question.
Itching is a difficult-to-treat side effect of many dermatoses and internal diseases.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
Capsaicin, when applied topically, blocks unmyelinated polymodal C and A nerve fibres after an initial stage of neurogenic inflammation, selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological disease pattern that is problematic both in terms of diagnosis and treatment.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40% respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as an operative alternative in therapy-refractory testicular algia.
12 patients were operated on by seminal vesicle neurolysis following adequate environmental diagnostics:
The M. cremastericus is cut by means of bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of A. testicularis is removed under microsurgical conditions on a 2-3 cm length of section.
At a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) were free of symptoms.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations for patients with chronic testalgia.
The high success rate of our operative procedure can only be maintained if the indication is exact, so that precise environmental diagnosis is essential to exclude a specific genesis of the test algae.
In neurosurgery too, the trend is towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimise the preparatory trauma to the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to minimise the risk of neurological and psychological disorders.
The hospital stay and the incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
The main "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
The brain, with its preformed cavities, cerebral chambers, and subarachnoid space, provides a good basis for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic intervention is hydrocephalus.
But also arachnoidal cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular space requirements can be effectively treated endoscopically through a small drill hole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, such as cavernous sinuses, can be completely removed.
Endoscopes are also used in a number of spinal disorders and carpal tunnel syndrome, and as an adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by means of diffusion weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body perimetastases and in MR morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the tissue specific ADC, which is the intrinsic diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
A low ADC is expected in cell-rich tumour tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i. e. diffusion barriers), while a high ADC is expected in low- or necrotic tissue.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanocytic lung tumour which had completely blocked the left main bronchus and its base was located in the bronchus of the left subclavian.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lung underlayment was performed.
Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumour was classified as malignant melanoma.
There was no history of previous removal of skin, mucous membrane or eye changes.
The targeted examinations of the skin and eye also showed no evidence of a primary tumour located there.
Thus, the neoplasm is considered to be a primary respiratory malignant melanoma, of which 21 cases are considered to be confirmed so far.
The patient is tumour-free after a relatively short follow-up period of about 10 months.
There is no experience with twilight vision after LASIK.
So we looked at twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has become a standard method for noninvasive diagnosis of ischemia.
Ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging can be used to perform pharmacological stress protocols identical to those currently used in echocardiography.
HLA-DR antigens from the cornea are lost during organ culture storage.
This work examined whether this is downregulation of the HLA-DR antigen or loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).
DNA cytometry has become a routine diagnostic technique, preferably used in breast cancer to assess the plaidia and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry because of its lower validity.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, firstly the S-phase and the proliferation index, and secondly the plaidia, are important factors for prognosis and for the planning of therapy.
A precise knowledge of the method and the possibility of error is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be considered as uncertain at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric tests and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of measured values.
In the case of cervical syndromes, injection therapy is of major importance.
This paper will cover both the general requirements and the various practical procedures for injection.
Summary The cost of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV is not covered by statutory health insurance, and the question of private health insurance coverage is not to be considered.
The provisions on the prevention of disease (Section 20 of the VGB), medical care (Section 23 of the VGB) and health examinations (Section 25 of the VGB) will not be considered as legal bases for the reimbursement of costs.
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as there are no corresponding recommendations of the Federal Committees.
It would be desirable to adopt recommendations soon to remove the legal uncertainty in this area.
In certain circumstances, the legal form of the so-called new methods of investigation and treatment may make it possible to impose an obligation to bear the costs.
However, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP themselves need to be clarified and cleared of ambiguities with regard to indication and mode of administration.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a medical error, since there are still too many uncertainties from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in the immunology of transplantation.
The organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive Langerhans corneal cells.
The previous work examines the importance of an extended corneal storage time for the success of a perforating keratoplasty.
Based on own experience with 3D echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontaneal studies in 3D and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent adverse reaction in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin for Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after 105 days of intensive care with 72 days of respiration, developed heterotopic ossifications on five large joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive care was a double transplant in severe pulmonary hypertension.
The ossification of the right shoulder, the equilateral elbow and both hip joints was resected to restore mobility.
Heterotope ossifications are common and occur particularly post-traumatic, after spinal cord injury, after SHT, in intoxication and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is not yet known, it is assumed that mesenchymal cells transform into osteoblasts and chondroblasts, which then determine bone formation.
The diagnosis is made by means of imaging techniques.
Prophylactic treatment may be with medication, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) who was the first to use the argon laser for topical therapy.
The patient had long-standing skin lesions that were not or only slightly affected by established treatment strategies.
After application of the argon laser, the treated lesions were completely and permanently healed.
Histological and immunohistological evidence suggests that vascular mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-induced discoid lesions.
These case reports are the first to demonstrate the efficacy of the argon laser in the treatment of treatment-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common overall indication for liver transplantation.
For the patient concerned, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Re-infection with hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favourable prognosis compared to HBV re-infection.
Effective prophylaxis of reinfection in hepatitis C has not yet been established and extensive studies are still required.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for transplantation is less favourable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity on the basis of a case study and the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumours is surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
The exception is rhabdomyosarcoma, which also responds well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in preeclampsia is an interventional treatment with a curative claim.
Accessory conduction pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodrome or antidrome reentry tachycardia of varying incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in the tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitatory conduction system and detecting further paraspecific fibres are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Tricuspid or coronary sinus abnormalities and co-occurring cardiac disease should be evaluated by echocardiography prior to intervention and, if appropriate, by contrast imaging at the beginning of the intervention.
In 300 patients with pre-excitation syndrome, self-reported catheter ablation results are presented.
In order to achieve a better qualitative recording of the occurrence of complications in orthopaedics and to have comparable statistics over years, a standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
The Foundation Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg has been keeping a complete, consensual register of all early complications of all inpatients since 1 January 1997.
The complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication programme according to a standardised nomenclature and the data are checked, corrected and supplemented and classified by the clinic's quality management department.
The guide is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard for the identification and evaluation of orthopaedic complications with the aim of reaching a consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterised by the appearance of blisters in the acromion region during the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, the underlying cause is likely to be a dermoepidermal cohesion impairment, which is mandatory during treatment and is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of prallic blisters.
Acrobullosis photodermatosis should be differentiated from phototoxic reactions due to excessive UVA exposure or excessive psoralene concentrations.
Two cases are used to illustrate the clinical, pathophysiological and differential diagnosis of this disease.
In addition to autopsy-confirmed findings of fibrolipomatosis of the right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplastic cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological characteristics, which have been divided into main and secondary criteria.
The following study, in a group of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, is intended to test the validity of the criteria developed.
Global or segmental right ventricular dilatation as a primary criterion was detected by angiography or echocardiography in 20 patients (83%).
4 patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of right ventricular segmental kinetic abnormalities.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatosis of the right ventricular myocardium was detected histologically.
T-inversions in right precordial derivatives were present as secondary criteria in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS spread of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
Late potential analysis by means of signal-measuring ECG was available in only 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of secondary criteria.
Left femoral block chamber tachycardia, which was classified as a secondary criterion, was detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died without evidence of arrhythmias due to progressive right heart failure.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary endpoint was obtained in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD produced a diagnosis of disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a reliable histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without the inclusion of histological data, clinical diagnosis could be made in only 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favourable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria will make a purely clinical diagnosis more likely.
There is clear evidence that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycaemia in cerebral ischemia is controversial.
The inconsistent results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained by considering different types of stroke separately and by taking into account the time course of blood glucose levels during the acute event.
Hyperglycaemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia when there is insufficient collateral supply.
The risk of haemorrhagic transformation is also increased during this period.
In contrast, acute elevation of blood glucose can protect nerve tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply, if there is only a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is present in the area of the penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative as well as the positive effects of acute hyperglycaemia are dependent on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgical diagnosis, according to which 50 of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy underwent resective epilepsy surgery.
The localization agreement of findings from noninvasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intercatal positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was the basis for focus localization.
78% (n=39) of the 50 patients became seizure-free or had very rare seizures.
Extra-oral resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if there were defined MRI lesions and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, particularly temporal epilepsy, noninvasive EEG references are sufficient in pre-surgical diagnosis and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
History and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented to an outpatient clinic with a new onset of tachycardia absoluta.
Echocardiographically, an intracardial space requirement was initially suspected and further clarification was required by transesophageal echocardiography.
In the ECG, absolute tachycardia was found with frequencies up to 146/min, intermittent sinus rhythm was also documented.
This was also confirmed in the chest X-ray as a large space requirement in projection on the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal edge predominantly lateral.
Due to the displacement growth of the cyst with the initiation of atrial rhythm disturbances and to safely exclude malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy.
The patient has since been in sinus rhythm and complains only of isolated "outsetters" most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primary, apparently harmless atrial arrhythmias may also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or even intra-cardiac space requirements, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute meningitis can have a variety of causes.
Rare cause of paresis of one or more cerebral nerves is dissection of the A. carotis interna.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even in the case of atypical symptoms, is important because timely anticoagulation therapy can prevent stroke as a consequence of dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous nerves (Raeder syndrome) and the caudal nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the A. carotis interna.
In addition to the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cerebral nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden loss of the cerebral nerve must also be thought of as a carotid dissection.
The failure of the right coronary artery to branch from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remaining asymptomatic into old age, but may also become clinically evident in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of an asymptomatic 15-month-old child, as well as the need for surgical correction.
The suspect diagnosis was made by chance in the course of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation involved the transplantation of the coronary artery defect without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial fractures involving joints (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on the trauma management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the management of articulatory fractures offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result through a small amount of soft tissue trauma caused by surgery.
The aim is to achieve at least exercise stability, even compared with standard procedures.
In addition to the minor operative soft tissue trauma, the accurate intraoperative assessment of joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intraarticular concomitant injuries are particularly advantageous compared to conventional procedures.
Of a total of 54 patients with tibial fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in our clinic on 34 patients between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed good overall results on the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a selected patient population, we consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be appropriate for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3 as well.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, following moderate traumatic brain injury, developed bilateral hypoglossal susparesis without other neurological deficits, which recovered clinically completely within 3 months.
Since CT scan has not detected a skull base fracture in the posterior cranial fossa, we are discussing bilateral rupture of the N. hypoglossus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition in which the blood cannot be pumped out of the leg veins in sufficient quantities under the conditions of daily life.
The residue is propagated from the large veins to the smallest venules and down to the microcirculation area, eventually affecting the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features that can be secondarily confirmed by a simple objective measurement procedure are best used as the basis for classification principles.
Stewart's blue colour syndrome is defined as an angioedema that develops on the floor of arteriovenous short circuits.
Skin changes in the lower extremities are usually unilateral and resemble Kaposi' s sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi' s sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and rarely hypertrophy of the affected limb.
The disease is often rapidly progressive, resulting in ulcerative nodules with a tendency to bleed and become infected.
The causal therapy is the removal of the arteriovenous shunts.
Surgery is rarely possible because of the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more appropriate, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
It reports on the successful completion of eight embolization procedures in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart' s blue-colored syndrome.
Previously, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary skin histiocytoses was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granule) and freeze-cut immunohistology (CD1a) in addition to clinical and histology on the H&E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-containing markers now make it possible to work out (also retrospectively) and classify these diseases accurately on formaldehyde-infected material.
Antibodies against S-100 protein and the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) can be used to distinguish the classic Langerhans cell histiocytopenes (LZH) from other histiocytic cell systems.
The so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LZH) have not had uniform electronoptic and immunohistological characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of major importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
The frequencies and distributions of the different monocyte/ macrophage and dendritic cells and their responses to the corresponding paraffin-sensitive immunohistological markers may vary widely within the different clinical entities.
Diagnostic significance in terms of differentiation from the Langerhans cell histiocytoses appears to be antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown in the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in juvenile Xanthogranuloma).
Both markers show a positive pattern of response with the epithelial cells typical of the disease process.
The following is a case report of a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of allopurinol administration and subsequent re-exposure to this drug.
A malignant bladder cancer (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had suffered from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner' s ulcer for 10 years.
To date, seven case reports of non-bilharziosis-associated squamous bladder cancer have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of squamous bladder carcinoma as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of squamous bladder carcinoma development appears to be chronic bladder irritation.
After exhausting all conservative treatment options, the radical cystectomy and supravesical urethral drainage were performed.
'NoToX Histological Fixative' is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examination.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistological staining, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.
These studies, carried out independently at three different institutions, showed that NoToX-fixed tissue samples showed no differences from formalinfected tissue samples in terms of the reproducibility of conventional staining and the visibility of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
Dose values such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and the open air axis dose are commonly used to describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography.
The CTDI and the MSAD derived from it are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the volume of the study, but they do not indicate much about the doses relevant from the point of view of the physician and the patient, according to the sensitivity of the organs to radiation, and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose to allow an estimation of risk.
The indication of an upper limit for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirements of the test region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all three are useful for characterizing and differentiating different radiation exposure test programmes and equipment.
The definition of inflammatory cardiomyopathy was expanded in 1995 following a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been re-included in this definition.
Therefore, a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses, appear to be important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory cardiomyopathy and ventricular dilation.
It seems reasonable to assign shame as a general human emotion a separate place from guilt.
In addition to its defensive nature, shame's "self-sustaining" function should also be considered.
The presence of shame always indicates the protection of self-esteem, even if it should not be presently detectable in the patient.
The signalling character of shame is discussed and the question whether shame symptoms have a pathological value is considered.
The attention to psychogenesis and the unconscious dynamics of shame expands the view of potentially embarrassing situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the treatment of acute psychosocial crises, which is highly heterogeneous in terms of both crisis understanding and therapeutic methods and in terms of professional competence.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, specific disorder and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents over the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant to crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
The main reason for the increase in the number of deaths is the increased programmed cell death (apoptosis).
Coronary artery dissection samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL fragmented DNA assay) and electron microscopically.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on specially fixed cadavers, using techniques developed by Thiel in 1992, the transversal fascia was examined in relation to the balloon and what happened to it when the balloon was inflated.
In TEP, the fascia may be used as a reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as a counter-layer to fix the foreign material (net) at the lateral side of the artery.
We're presenting two patients, aged 50 and 84, who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scales led to the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
In both cases, an underlying disease could be excluded.
It is suspected that the treatment of eczema for months by means of immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Haemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The efficacy of haemoglobin solutions in O2 transport and in particular in effective O2 delivery to tissues has been demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme haemodilution and haemorrhagic shock.
Genetic and chemical modifications can stabilize the hemoglobin molecule.
This results in a clinically viable intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity and no nephrotoxicity.
As a residual side effect of the haemoglobin solutions evaluated today, a certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned.
Nevertheless, haemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme haemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured patients.
The introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is based strictly on clear physical laws and defined physiological regularities.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, where it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive, therapeutic component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive care unit.
Among the potential side effects, besides barotrauma of the lungs, the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication should be considered in particular.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication, and the skills and abilities to safely manage complications arising from intensive or emergency medical care.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation, with its interdisciplinary, emergency or intensive nature, should therefore be an additional field of activity of great interest to the anaesthetist.
Our interest is in the interaction of high-energy ultrasonic waves with biological tissues in the context of oncological therapy.
The physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized in this paper.
The preliminary results give reason for hope that ultrasound, because of its good depth-focusing capability, could be used as an additional therapeutic technique in tumors accessible by sonication.
The experimentally observed ultrasonic induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasonic parameters.
New results show that nuclear spectroscopy is suitable for the on-line monitoring of ultrasound induced high temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive nuclear spectroscopy temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumours be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
The long-term effects of preterm birth on ophthalmic and ENT status should be demonstrated in a group of extremely small preterm infants.
Since 1993, the University Orthopaedic Clinic Homburg/Saar has been using a computer system for surgical and outpatient documentation and for supporting the general clinical organisation.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a specialised medical documentation database application with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its launch, the system has included data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 operations.
The software is flexible enough to meet both medical and administrative requirements.
Furthermore, a further networking at the clinic level at the University Hospital Homburg provides the possibility of interdepartmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks and the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centres on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following approach is recommended.
The aim of the study was to investigate whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
It also points to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with current compensation practices.
This study in sheep was to investigate whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulphurised and unsulphurised glycosaminoglycans is correlated with the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether a temporal assignment is possible and whether the results suggest a continuation of the use of GAGs as a prognostic criterion or arthritic marker.
The 21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals:
The controls are the knee joints of the contralateral side and knee joints from animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological scores between the TD vs. ME and MV groups differed statistically significantly (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, the HA value is significantly increased in the ME and MV groups.
In CS, significantly increased levels (p < 0.01) were observed at 6 months postoperatively in the ME group and at 1 year post-partum.
Clinical effects:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - a description of the degree of arthrosis.
Concentrations increase with longer postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
Blocker therapy is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In case of treatment failure, pacemaker implantation or sympathetic blockade surgery may be considered as an option.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
The article describes the additions and use of an epidiaoscope which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ slides in general and special pathology courses and saves on expensive video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older age and are of wide-ranging significance.
These problems are here related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between the ego and the ego ideal in age.
In three aspects, pathological exacerbations of the ageing process, as often seen in elderly patients, are shown.
Narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are then described and options and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The results of the Mitchell muscle energy technique in spinal disorders are presented.
The muscular energy technique can be used to diagnose joint mobility disorders in the pelvis, spine and ribs.
The therapy is highly successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to pulse chiropractic techniques.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with Duhring's herpetiform dermatitis, a disease known since the age of 10, who complained of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhoea and symptoms of sicca.
Clinical picture, serologic findings, and histologies of the duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy indicate that the diagnosis is celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
We have not yet been able to describe a common occurrence of these different pathologies.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be considered as the real disturbance in the structure of the individual immunological disease patterns.
In industrialized lands, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are more likely to contribute to malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the elderly population, occurring in 5-12% of the independent elderly, 30-61% of the hospitalized elderly and 40-85% of the elderly in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
Increased medical awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important for the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevus showed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
The species is characterised by a number of distinctive features, including digitalis radialis, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster plaster lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodium-like border zones and blue-in-pink areas.
However, specific light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumour is based on several individual, combined, suspected malignant features.
The article gives a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy procedures in cartilage regeneration.
Commonly used vector transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into target cells are presented.
The transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists is also providing new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical feasibility studies involving the transfer of such a gene (IRAP) represent a significant step towards the clinical gene therapy of osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for the correction of hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experience with unidirectional and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extra-oral administration in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic disease patterns.
These included 1 boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia with Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Rodger syndrome and 1 rare case of midline defect with 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with bone gains of 6-28 mm.
Older people interested in continuing education are increasingly recognising the many opportunities the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further education and training institutions for the elderly are required to facilitate access to the digital media world for older people through targeted services, to support them in acquiring media skills and to create interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on experience gained from the 'Senior Info-Mobile' information campaign, it describes ways of giving people over 50 access to the new communication technologies.
The European Learning in Later Life (LiLL) network and other projects further demonstrate how spatially and temporally decoupled'research learning' of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a 'new learning culture' that also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or training institution or who cannot participate in local offerings for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MRI has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, the invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by the noninvasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MRI has in recent years also opened up the possibility of new functional methods of investigation.
Cardiac MRI is characterised by the combination of simultaneous detection of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, the Cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to diagnose many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only technique that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of cardiac MRI.
MRI is the only diagnostic procedure that can provide complete diagnosis of cardiac disease in a single examination, both as an initial examination and as a follow-up.
The rapid development will solve in the foreseeable future the remaining limitations, particularly in the field of MR coronary angiography.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and computing at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg is given.
Since its establishment in 1967, four phases of development have been distinguished:
The first medical initiatives, the establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic planning of information systems, the implementation of information systems with the possibility of medical control and thus control of the performance.
The planning and implementation were carried out in accordance with the framework plans and concepts of the University Hospital of Baden-Württemberg.
We're reporting a deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac pressure massage.
This is the first published case.
We report a bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation into an iliac artery with consequent septic embolism, ipsilateral kneecap and formation of an infected spurious aneurysm.
The cause is assumed to be Staphylococcus aureus contamination of the stent.
Treatment was resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem of a six-year-old boy with a type II unilateral split foot with oligodaktylia and clinodaktylia of the second toe.
This review article looks at the current state of controversy surrounding the patella back surface replacement indication.
The current state of experimental and biomechanical knowledge is described, as are the design features of the various types of implants and the special features of the patella preparation.
The author also discusses the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar surface replacement and tries to give the reader criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for the replacement of the back surface is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patellar back surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes of the migration and loosening behaviour of hip joint prostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to altered rigidity and damping properties of the overall system cannot be excluded.
Arterial hypertension is commonly observed in adult patients following organ transplantation as a consequence of treatment with the hypertensive medicinal products cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
There is little research on the behaviour of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" refers to the absence of visible signs of fracture on conventional radiography for initial diagnosis, despite the presence of a fracture.
The diagnosis is only made during the course of the disease or by further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (Computer Tomography) tests carried out for this purpose have only a moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that allows early diagnosis of the occult fracture as well as the diagnosis of any accompanying chondral and ligament injuries.
In this study, we report 23 patients with traumatic fractures in five different anatomical regions, which could be diagnosed with negative X-rays using MRI.
The atherosclerotic embolism is an early phenomenon.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal arteries gave rise to the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical picture and the need for invasive or post-mortem diagnosis, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe aortic atherosclerosis.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, proximal aortic atherosclerosis is a cause of embolic complications in surgical procedures or catheterization of the aorta.
In patients with a particular form of atherosclerosis in the aorta, with stepped and mobile thrombus arising from circumscribed plaques, anticoagulants have been shown to be effective.
Embolic recurrence was prevented and thrombus regression was observed.
A 62-year-old female patient with severe valgus deformity and right knee joint inhibition due to a supraconjunctival femoral fracture, who had been osteosynthetically treated with dynamic condyle screw 2 years ago, is reported.
In this case, the indication was variation and extension corrective osteotomy and retrograde femoral nail osteosynthesis.
The patient was able to fully strain the right lower extremity with axis alignment within the first postoperative week.
The principle of retrograde locking is a suitable method for achieving good and stress-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective operations.
Tear duct operations at the University Eye Clinic Münster were studied in 296 children from 1987 to 1992.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectonic and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus) are always suspected but are not themselves evidence of carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nuclear size, hyperchromatism, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) should always be evaluated in comparison with existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical finding with basal cell specific cytokeratin must in any case be critically evaluated and may at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (if positive for basal cells) safely rule out it.
This review summarises the various diagnostic criteria and evaluates their value for routine diagnosis.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 20 mg TNFR55-IgG1 i. v. for 14 days was compared with a monthly dose of 50 mg.
The 60 patients in this study had previously received an initial dose of 100 mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Thereafter, despite continued administration of the test substance, an increase in the inflammatory parameters was observed.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A case of a 13-month-old female patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to a sinusoidal haemangiomatosis has been reported.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
The newborn child is also entitled to optimal care so that any disorder in postnatal adaptation is detected in time.
The introduction of painless, simple and yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all those responsible.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of increases in resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in isolated Gonococcus strains in Berlin should be established.
Aquajogging is a technique used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are performed in deep water, supported by a lifting aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aquajogging is used as regenerative training and as "low-impact alternative training" in the strength and endurance range.
In rehabilitation, aquajogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for musculoskeletal disorders, and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular surgery or prosthetics.
The current state of vascular surgery suggests that penile revascularisation surgery is the only causal therapy that has a place in a selected patient population.
The most important criteria are age below 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be adjusted to about 53-55% against initial short-term results of over 80%.
Venous surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic decline in long-term consequences (on average below 40%).
Penile prosthesis surgery has higher success rates with 85-90 percent long-term survival rates of implants and 89 percent patient satisfaction.
However, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this treatment option to be the last in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations may occur with 5-year survival rates of implants ranging from 65-90%
This cause can never be eliminated by a perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limb grafts, which are highly immunogenic.
We report on our experience of the last three years with the method we have developed of homologous central limbocaretoplasty.
Pentosanpolysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly reduces nocturnal frequency, while the frequency of urination during the day remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also decreased nocturia frequency in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosane polysulphate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, including applications in radiology.
Thousands of websites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, with competition from commercial offerings.
The first experience is that the task today is to critically evaluate the opportunities and risks of using the Internet as a medium for the distribution of radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
We report below from a psychiatric and forensic point of view two cases in which the mothers reacted to SID with unusually severe depression and blamed themselves for killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations are given for the care of parents affected.
The review of the cases of 110 children admitted with Burkitt's lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, over a period of 7 years showed an excess of male versus female patients (1.9%) compared to the total number of children admitted with Burkitt's lymphoma in the same period.
1) and a maximum age of 5 years.
The first areas affected by the tumour were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen, and lungs were less affected.
It is thought that an interrelation between infections by malaria and Epstein-Barr virus and malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumour.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this medicinal product with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing disease recurrence but is superior to the single active substance in preventing systemic relapse.
Follow-up examinations of the patients showed a good survival rate.
The Zwickau Clinic was a well-known surgical centre since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Zwickauer's surgery provided important impetus for general and local anaesthesia, hospital construction and clinic organization, and surgical teaching in words and pictures.
After a brief review of the literature, the aim is to present the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have not been described so far in an adolescent patient.
In the context of earlier fears of abandonment, the threat of being abandoned is again present in the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which until now has served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematous squamous skin disease with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%.
The often difficult to treat skin lesions occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithanol, a substance that may however cause pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis following the administration of a 50-fold higher concentration of a prescription diithranol preparation in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
The renovascular hypertension is of particular importance as it is a secondary form of hypertension which can be successfully treated in many cases and in some cases cured by interventional radiological or plastic surgery.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications following LASIK should be investigated.
A case of an andrologic patient is reported in whom initial examination revealed high grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The elevated FSH level and the significantly below normal testicular size suggested a pronounced testicular parenchymal lesion.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculatory smear may be considered as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
Following antibiotic therapy with doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery period with combination therapy with vitamins C and E and the trace element zinc, significant improvement in sperm counts was observed.
After another 2 months, a pregnancy was achieved by intrauterine insemination, followed by the birth of a healthy daughter.
At this time, the patient had only mild teratozoospermia.
In a quality control study, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different established standard anaesthetic procedures.
Changes in retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serologic chorioretinopathy in the context of systemic corticosteroid therapy should be described.
The radiograph of the pelvic floor is still used today in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy, alongside sonography.
The legs of the infant should be kept in the middle position.
Side turns and increased inclination of the pelvis shall be avoided.
A look back at 150 years, 50 of which were personal experiences of the development of septorrhinoplasty, which last took a development back to the 19th century in the "open approach" with folding of the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
A sublabial approach to septorrhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatic surgery is recommended.
In the diagnostic imaging of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the thoracic radiograph is the first priority.
A thorough knowledge of the normal thoracic image and of possible physiological peripartal changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of neonatal thoracic imaging.
Paediatric disorders
A variety of congenital and acquired changes encountered by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in adult radiodiagnosis.
Many of these changes are life-threatening or can affect the quality of life of the patient later in life.
Early diagnosis in close collaboration with the paediatrician is therefore essential.
This is an overview of the main pathologies that the radiologist may encounter in his daily routine.
The primary tumours included mammalian carcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric carcinoma (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinoma (n = 6 each) and 14 other tumours.
Extrahepatic tumour incidence (including synchronous primary tumours) was 69 out of 140 (49%) cases, and 51% (n = 61) of the 120 first resections were extrahepatic tumour incidents.
Of the 120 primary resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0-, 13 (11%) as R1- and 25 (21%) as R2-resections.
Median survival was 20 months overall after first resection, 28 months after R0 resection and 8 months after R1/ 2 resection.
After second resection (n = 14) median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumour at the time of first liver resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/ 2 resection.
The present results show that resection of noncolorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also offers a promising prognostic advantage.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic relapses may even benefit from secondary or tertiary liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term trends were observed even in a less favourable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself was baffled by the impersonal act for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffered a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communicans.
In order to assess the capacity for culpability, this history, in conjunction with the alleged misconduct shortly before the crime, therefore allows the possibility of a mental disorder at the time of the crime to be taken into account.
This may have been an epileptic twilight condition as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also been proven to be effective for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated in the vitreous.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is floated and can be replanted in the anterior portion of the eye where it can be refixed, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
The nature of the contact between PFCL and the IOL is unclear.
Since biotoxicity of the PFCL is likely with prolonged intraocular residence, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of the operation.
A rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma has been reported.
Metastasis occurred after a seven-year symptom-free postoperative interval.
Further investigations did not reveal any clinically apparent metastases.
The forecast is very poor, however, taking into account the cases described so far.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic origin of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas anulare) of the two systems.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas anulare can ultimately only be secured by a gait representation of the pancreatic duct.
In the case of congenital diseases, genetic defects are present, usually involving other organ systems, and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually the main feature of the disease picture.
Both the developmental abnormalities of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes in the organ which can be detected by modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain more than the writer's own material.
The tablets of Bärensprung and Hebra show that at a second glance they reveal some other facts relevant to medical history.
Approximately 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/ defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-present congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel chest and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The detection of bacterial coxitis by ultrasound has been reviewed.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined by ultrasound.
The ultrasound image allows the joint capsule, the hip-head surface and the periarticular structures to be assessed in the standard cut levels of the DEGUM.
Intra-articular space requirements (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected by ultrasound as joint capsule distention.
This capsule ablation has been demonstrated by ultrasound in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and early-stage Perth disease.
Since joint capsule distention does not differ significantly between the individual diseases, the sonogram does not allow differentiation of these diseases in the presence of capsule distention without bone changes.
Bacterial coxitis cannot therefore be distinguished sonographically from coxids of other genera;
The capsule dilation is considered a non-specific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, prompt diagnostic puncture, possibly under sonographic control, is required.
Due to additional bone changes in addition to capsule distention, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes disease can be distinguished sonographically in the condensation and fragmentation stage from both bacterial coxitis and coxids of other genesis.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made by a combination of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
As both cases had unusually high levels of differentiation of tumour cells for gliomatosis cerebri, diagnosis was complicated by atypical findings such as contrast medium absorption in MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure elevation.
Clinical history, differential diagnosis and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomised clinical trial are presented, explained and problems identified.
Important aspects of randomised trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to arrive at statements about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements of clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but that in this sense good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
The potential influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has been evaluated in different ways.
The anticoagulant Phenprocoumon, which is used in Germany for therapeutic purposes, in particular, has been almost completely ignored in the studies.
This retrospective study was conducted to investigate a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61 to 85 years with arteriosclerotic symptomatic infrared aortic stenosis were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, a thrombus endarterectomy of the A. iliaca externa with profundaplastic was performed in one case, and an angioplasty with stent implantation of the A. iliaca communis was performed in another case.
Technical and clinical success was achieved in all cases.
No clotting or clinical restenosis occurred over a median observation period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a minimally invasive and safe procedure with good long-term outcomes.
Summary A patient who underwent several years of sterilization treatment and became pregnant, although she did not want a child, is reported.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has been classified in the past as being rather apathogenic to humans.
A case is described of a 72-year-old patient who had aspergillus flavus cultured in the tracheal secretion following aortic coronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit.
The serological test procedures carried out, the indirect haemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibodies coated latex particles, were repeatedly negative.
A postmortem aspergillosis test using a newer method, the enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiological findings.
The patient died before anti-fungal therapy was started, and the autopsy showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay may facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
Due to the correct assessment of pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even in the case of a single tracheal culture of Aspergillus flavus.
Epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidence of appendicitis and appendicectomy in developed countries.
The peak age range is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - and the high rate of perforations in young children and the elderly indicate low diagnostic confidence.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn on the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
After refractive surgery of the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular errors (aberrations) may occur which cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal conditioned vision is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image errors under clinical conditions would be an important first step in documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive techniques.
For both methods only static unidirectional tensile tests had been carried out experimentally.
Ecke and Hofmann thus came to the conclusion that flexible fixations could achieve comparable stability to rigid methods and that, because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis, their ankylosing for prophylaxis was preferable.
By means of simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations were tested comparatively by means of DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire harnesses and PDS bandings.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilisation).
Neither the wire harness nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, and these methods allowed symphysis mobility beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the course of the experiments, instability was increased by incisions in the cerclages and bandings in the bone or fracture of the wire cerclages in general, until complete failure.
In contrast, in the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizers, the success of stabilization was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
With primary over-turning of the screws, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic load.
With the primary stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable over 55 500 load changes with a load corresponding to half the average body weight.
For clinical use, these results suggest that neither the wire-cage bridge bracing nor the PDS banding is sufficient to stabilize the ruptured symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If the DC plate or reconstruction plate can primarily achieve safe stabilization of the ruptured symphysis by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with "open-book injury" can be mobilized with partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs) have been successfully implanted for years.
The light distribution to several focal points means that each image has a smaller amount of light available.
Additional reduction in light or scattered light effects due to capsular fibrosis may lead to early visual impairment.
In a 69-year-old female patient, a 5 cm moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumour was initially misdiagnosed as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Only during a 17 month follow-up was a 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma detected and resected by duodenopancreatectomy.
The reassessment of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumour as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died six months later of a stroke.
The autopsy results confirmed the assessment of the tumour as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug therapy for erectile dysfunction includes oral and topical administration of pharmaceutical agents.
The only approved oral substance with proven efficacy at this time is yohimbine, a centrally active alpha blocker.
Other oral medicinal products with a central point of attack are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine significantly more effective than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mode of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both the intraurethral (MUSE) and the intracavernous route of administration are available for topical application.
The substance used is prostaglandin E1 (Caverject), which has now largely supplanted other drugs.
Several promising substances with different modes of action and different dosage forms are currently under development as therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They alter the consciousness of the patient, contributing to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is especially important for more severely disturbed patients who cannot be sufficiently reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy have led to the development of a variety of different strategies, collectively referred to as immunotherapy.
The remission rates that can be achieved are generally between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients have a temporary stabilisation of the disease, which in some cases lasts for years.
The majority of these studies were uncontrolled Phase II studies.
Cures are not generally expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy patients over non- or chemotherapy patients.
A survival advantage is guaranteed for patients with objective remissions.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival benefit, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of conventional treatment protocols and their high cost must be considered.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates and the survival advantage for immunotherapy patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The use should normally be in clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, 262 males (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old) and 239 females (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old), the laboratory index values of 12 clinical chemical parameters are calculated and correlated with biological age according to Ries.
The calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between laboratory indicators and biological age are found only in the younger women group.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with premature ageing.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the distal sigmoid epiploic appendix was discovered as a random finding in a 72-year-old patient undergoing hysterectomy with adnexctomy for endometrial cancer.
It showed the same histology as analogous ovarian tumours and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive growths between the epiploic appendages and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal washing fluid.
These findings are likely to be due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
Histogenesis, histology and locations of the primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
The first hope was that this procedure would provide an optimized position for the patellar tooth transplantation, as well as advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique could not be proven so far.
15 endoscopic and 14 open surgery patients were examined preoperatively and 3 and 6 months post-operatively.
The Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems, ligament stability (KT-1000), surgical duration and proprioception were obtained using the angular reproduction test.
The energy dose of the spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the CT machine manufacturer for dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of the CT scan was 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin surface in beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm upper jaw scan distance, 30 mm lower jaw scan distance).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawed jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average accuracy of measurement was 0.1 to 0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approximately 76% had no effect on the longitudinal accuracy.
However, the energy dose of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans is still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectivised by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridisation) into virological diagnosis.
The introduction of histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium in patients with a clinical diagnosis of suspected dilated cardiomyopathy allows a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the 1995 WHO classification (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response which can be detected by histological and, in particular, immunohistological techniques.
It was only by combining histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques that a subgroup analysis was possible to determine the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to the bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/ postoperative) forms, the bacterial endogenous (haematogenic) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of bacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which, unlike the others, manifests itself predominantly in the clavicle, can be distinguished.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis treated from 1978 to 1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case studies.
Although rare, primary chronic sclerosing clavicular osteomyelitis must be considered for differential diagnosis, since it is a conservative drug therapy domain after biopsy confirmation.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication following cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatments, it is often difficult to cure.
The treatment of malignant tumors is based on the four pillars of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The paper examines the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimisation of chemotherapy protocols in three major oncological diseases, using a literature analysis.
Both tumor models and the hypotheses derived from them, and above all well designed clinical trials, can allow advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumour diseases.
Castleman' s disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative agent, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms which ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
This paper presents the in vitro and in vivo results of our research on paclitaxel.
After comparison of 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in vivo use.
The effects of paclitaxel were demonstrated in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall by means of staining of the cytoskeleton and electron optics.
In rabbits, topically applied paclitaxel resulted in significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and vascular diameter expansion compared to balloon-dilated controls.
In additional studies, a drastic reduction in vascular contractile force was demonstrated after administration of paclitaxel.
In addition to age-related deposition of waste products between the cytoplasmic and basal membranes of RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), various manifestations of early and late AMD, such as glands, chorioid neovascularisations and pigment epithelial ablation, show a rupture of the membrane between the basal membrane of RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether age-related regression of the adhesion apparatus can be detected.
Recent research has shown that spinal cord dysplasia and spondylolysis are the result of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the location of the lesion and the type of visual impairment, in order to allow early operative therapy with maintenance of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of frequent dermatoses, there are no suitable animal models that occur in nature.
The transgenic technology that was established in the 1980s is closing this gap.
It was initially a tool in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also made its way into clinically oriented specific dermatological basic research.
It has made it possible to simulate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses in the mouse model and gain insight into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also allows the induction of cutaneous tumours.
The existence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows the targeted research of experimental therapies, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in wearers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic problems, such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal complaints in the knee, can be better investigated by MRI than by other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect wearers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in wearers of artificial heart valves does not appear to be adequate.
Therefore, a survey was conducted in 1998 among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on unseen tests or blamed the doctor who performed the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prosthesis.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and requirements for MRI safety standards in wearers of artificial heart valves is given.
In an experimental study, 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg were administered intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml of bolus administration, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after 30 ml of bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5) none of the animals died or required resuscitation.
Low-soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old female patient with disseminated granuloma annulare in known diabetic metabolic condition.
Additionally, there was renal failure, which prevented us from receiving oral photochemotherapy.
We performed a balneophotochemotherapy with 8-Methoxypsoral Whole Body Baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments resulted in complete reversal of the lesions on the trunk and neck and marked improvement in the skin finding on the extremities.
There were no side effects.
The therapeutic effect of balneophotochemotherapy is not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (CCD) is an infectious disease little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago was the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, isolated.
In the majority of cases, a typical disease pattern is found with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Other organ manifestations are less common.
We report on a 47-year-old patient who developed reactive spondyloarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbar lesions after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
To date, only a few cases of joint participation in a KKK have been described.
However, as the incidence of Bartonella henselae in cats is high in Europe, it may be a more common cause of joint complaints than previously thought.
The diagnosis of CKD has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We will give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Continuous optimisation of therapy over the past few years has significantly improved the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a wide range of possible long-term complications, which the treating physician needs to be aware of.
The patients, mostly young, suffer from long-term impairment of their quality of life due to fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia following primary successful therapy is a significant problem.
The first is that the relationship between the individual and the society is not a function of the individual's behaviour, but of the individual's behaviour in relation to the society.
Main 1990) was to make these patterns operational in the sense of their original definition, i.e. as specific configurations of characteristics.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "secure", "avoidant", and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
The results of the factor analysis were used to construct three scales:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters which can be interpreted as attachment styles:
'secure', two variants of 'uncertain-ambivalent' ('closed' and 'clinging') and two variants of 'uncertain-avoidant' ('closed' and 'cooperative').
The discrimination analysis of these clusters yielded discrimination functions similar to those of Collins and Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al. (1991).
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive inner-ear hearing loss, vertigo and the simultaneous radiological evidence of contrast-absorbing space requirements of the inner ear canal reinforced the suspicion of the presence of acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old female patient with no history of Sharp's syndrome and the initial typical constellation of findings.
The case studies presented show a case of large lymphoma in the area of the angle of the cerebellum, which manifested itself with peripheral nerve failure in the CNS and initially lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the absence of only peripheral nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
Facial paralysis occurring within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia with radiation into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings such as the one described above, despite the presence of the leading symptoms, must be challenging to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification.
The occurrence of solitary lymphomas in the angle of the cerebellum is considered to be rare.
The gynaecologist can also use balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or complementary treatment options in the clinic, in the clinic and in the rehabilitation department.
In gynaecology, balneogyncology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a natural treatment method.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures should be used primarily as complementary measures in relation to the indication.
Only in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they particularly suitable for reducing pain and for positive tissue effects as primary measures.
The conventional mycobacterial diagnostic method currently requires an average of four weeks for a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent susceptibility testing.
The test chemical should be administered to the test organism in the same manner as the test chemical.
Faster results can be obtained at individual diagnostic steps by new techniques such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The alarming epidemiological situation of the risk of tuberculosis infection worldwide leaves no doubt that methods need to be developed to detect, differentiate and test for susceptibility to antibiotics mycobacteria of high sensitivity and specificity in the shortest possible time.
A prospective randomised trial compares non-articular external small AO fixator mounting for distal radius fracture (A2/A3 AO classification) with the provision of percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated milk has a long tradition in Germany.
Modern screening methods are used to rule out the transmission of infections.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, the milk of donors who have premature babies is preferred for very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day care centres (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centres (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care facilities.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the general lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and their working methods.
In the present study 100 visitors to TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
The characteristics of the social situation, the psychopathological symptoms and the views of the visitors were collected.
Nearly all the visitors had previously been in a psychiatric hospital.
The actual psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with a moderate degree of severity.
Two thirds of the visitors were single, most of them living alone and having few or no friends.
The positive aspects of the facilities were mainly the contact with other people and the day-to-day organisation.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
TSn visitors were on average younger and had higher scores on the BPRS sub-scale of energy.
The other characteristics of the visitors to the two institutions were hardly different.
The results suggest that both institutions are indeed providing the care for which they were designed for chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
The limits and consequences of the results are discussed.
Functional examinations of the brain have long been possible only with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of rapid imaging sequences, optimised contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods have made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1 and T2* weighted contrast-assisted imaging sequences can be used to obtain information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and blood-brain barrier permeability using specific models, e.g. from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be represented by diffusion-weighted MRI, time-dissolved macrovasculature, and MR angiographic techniques.
MR spectroscopy allows multi-dimensional measurement of metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissues and observation of metabolic processes in progress.
The advantages of MRI are its low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods already available in clinical use are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumour diagnostics, functional MRI techniques provide important additional information for the design, planning and monitoring of therapy.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are capable of sensitively detecting pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared objective of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to raise the level of health protection in the countries of the European region to the highest possible level, also in the face of constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors that affect health should be combated internationally by means of concrete measures or, better, prevented.
The key to this is agreement on international environmental and health standards and coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
Ensure that governments and the population concerned develop a common understanding of the major environmental health issues.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997 with the financial support of the Federal Ministry of Health.
A case of right-sided amaurosis fugax with concomitant fronto-basal fracture following a fall is reported in a 30-year-old patient.
CT and MR angiography showed that A. ophthalmica was closed following dissection of A. carotis interna with ascending thrombosis as the cause.
No other neurological deficits were present, as adequate blood supply to the cerebral arteries via the Circulus arteriosus cerebri was ensured.
In the aetiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be considered aetiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically, if appropriate.
Suspected acute aortic dissection should be investigated immediately by appropriate imaging techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, nuclear spectroscopy or aortography.
In the case presented here, an aortic dissection was suspected by echocardiography in an asymptomatic patient.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other imaging procedures to diagnose evidence of houstering of the aneurysmically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital with acute chest pain, increasing dyspnoea and a picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In the further clarification by echocardiography, a ruptured sinus valve aneurysm of the right coronary artery with left-right shunt into the right atrium could be determined by non-invasive means.
The heart surgery went smoothly, preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right-heart sections were normal width, and the color Doppler no longer detected shunts.
Acute heart failure can also occur in middle age as a result of congenital heart defects.
Echocardiography, and especially transesophageal echocardiography, has been used to make a precise diagnosis by noninvasive means.
Rodent syndrome is characterized by mandibular-facial and extremity malformations.
Lower jaw hypoplasia may cause airway obstruction by affecting the tongue at the back of the throat, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who, due to persistent dyspnoea, received nasal CPAP and sedation for five months.
After extensive treatment of the soft tissues, lower jaw distractively osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic result are good.
Respiratory obstruction and dyspnoea were not observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thrombo-artery resection (TEA) of A. carotis interna results in improved perfusion in the area of the artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors on the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the treatment of a specific disease case by means of modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (first ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice is largely defined, and it is still unclear whether adequate remuneration is paid for this independent medical service.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
There is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
We present a 38-year-old patient who has suffered for years from progressive effluvium in psoriatic nests on the capillary bed.
Histologically imposed strangulated fibrosis in place of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytes infiltrate into the upper dermis, which have invaded the epithelium of preserved hair follicles and are hallmarks of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical history and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important in that consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent the effluvium and thus possibly the formation of scarring.
Reduced production of thyroid hormone (GH) is seen in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improved several clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The decreased GH secretion is thought to be due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent periods of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenal tone stimulates the release of somatostatin, resulting in reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behaviour (SVB).
However, the effectiveness of conventional neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled studies, risperidone, a serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist, was also effective in reducing SVV in the long term.
The present study was designed to create an osteoporotic model using ovariectomy.
Osteodensitometry measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA before and after ovariectomy.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovarectomy was seen in both the upper and lower jaws.
Patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic knee haemarthrosis were evaluated and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the transfusions were varied:
In addition to vascular abnormalities like hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from eroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
The surgical, mostly arthroscopic, treatment was successful.
In Germany, toxic snakebite injuries in children are almost exclusively caused by vipers (Vipera berus).
The C. cruzi injects a toxin made up of various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Childhood poison ivy bites can be asymptomatic but can also cause severe poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their environment can be represented on a large scale.
The transmission of the ultrasound result to the therapists not present at the examination and the control of a result, e.g. a tumour, during therapy are thus considerably improved.
Viruses have also become more mobile as a result of increased human travel and activity around the world.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies has resulted in more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world being received in less and less time.
This paper examines the factors that may influence early or late diagnosis of dementia, using four case studies.
We have indicated surgery in all our cases.
The perforation site was primarily sewn over and extensively rinsed and drained.
In two cases the suture was additionally secured by fibre glue or by a plastic seal.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
On the basis of these own results and after an analysis of the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified:
If early perforation is secured, definitive surgical intervention is indicated.
Even in the case of delayed diagnosis of advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
Additional protection is recommended in these cases.
Resection procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high operative risk.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidneys, Wilms' tumors are 2 to 8 times more common.
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed-tissue tumors that rarely have a large proportion of adipose tissue.
We're reporting on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which, due to a large lipomatosis fraction with internal calcification, could have been a teratoma by radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in various cross-sectional imaging procedures are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations were correlated in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumour.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare condition that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
We have reports of a 58-year-old patient with a six-month history of bloody-bitter expectoration and significant weight loss who was referred to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
It was only by a diagnostic detour that the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could be made.
The trigger was an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
With antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of the disease rapidly regressed and the patient was eventually cured.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of the diagnostic process for differential diagnosis of thoracic space requirements, which include inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.
In hereditary haemorrhagic teleangiocentesis (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation of the liver.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
A case of a 53-year-old female patient whose percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavourable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, the adaptive "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The technique described thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies of benign diseases in the own study material over 20 years.
While the prevalence of puerperal mastitis in relation to the number of births is now about 1%, the various forms of non-puerperal mastitis have come to the forefront both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as concomitant phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small proportion is the expression of an irritant-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or paniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumour-like fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without evidence of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and in cases of suspected excitotoxic mastitis, bacteriological and microbiological examinations of the fresh material should always be carried out.
Infectious colitis with the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in patients with weakened immune systems or treated with antibiotics.
We report on boys aged 25 and 14 years with Clostridium difficile colitis without the above conditions or any underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the application of a suitable protocol leads to an earlier onset of withdrawal and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily respiratory screening and spontaneous respiration tests are valuable aids that should be included in a withdrawal protocol.
Once the condition and ability to spontaneously exhale are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as there is sufficient evidence that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous respiration attempt.
Stealthy mechanical ventilation may be discontinued in patients who have failed to achieve spontaneous respiration.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the rate and extent of withdrawal success and that SIMV is the least successful withdrawal technique.
Secondary septorrhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the baseline and surgical outcomes in 30 patients with one-sided LKG columns.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the deformity of the nose.
The softness analysis of the nose was performed by measuring standardised nasal scans and the lateral distal radiograph.
Deviations from the ideal shape were determined in the nasal symmetry, nasal width and nasal wing line.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasal-facial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurter Horizontal and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurter Horizontal.
For the evaluation of air permeability, anterior rhinomanometry was used.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined and the flow of the cleft and non-cleft sides was compared.
The studies were carried out immediately before and 6 months after surgery.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of nasal symmetry and an alignment of the nasal wing inclination is achieved.
Significant improvement in the nasopharyngeal angle and the deep nasal wing was not achieved.
The intervention increased the total flow and corrected the flow quotient of the cleft and non-cleft sides.
The methods of analysis used make it possible to objectivise the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings and thus serve as a quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents following manual spine therapy from 1989 to 1996 were examined.
There are no properly conducted prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with spinal manipulation in the literature.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of hip joint disease.
Conventional MRI can reliably show normal and acutely injured ligaments.
However, in the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, the joint fluid necessary for an accurate delineation of the injured ligaments is often lacking.
In these cases, MR arthrography should be performed as intra-articular CM application distends the joint space with improved distinctiveness of intra-articular structures.
This joint dilation with MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage assessment of osteochondritis dissecans, as in cases of unstable lesions, a KM flush of the dissect can be more easily represented.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distention, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free joint bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
Although invasive, MR arthrography provides essential additional information in the investigation of post-traumatic hip joint and various hip joint diseases.
The therapeutic objective of resuscitation must be the social reintegration of the person after acute treatment, ideally to the state prior to the onset of the emergency.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation following out-patient cardiovascular arrest in a rural area.
Varicocele is the most important acute complication of a V. sapheno-magna and/ or parva type of primary varicose veins.
Ascension may cause thrombus to migrate into the deep venous system via the entrance of the femoral and knee capillaries or via insufficient V. perforans, threatening the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicocele of the trunk veins without involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and/or parva and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient V. perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, surgery is only performed after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes the crocectomy, the extirpation of the stem veins through separate incisions, the exhairesis of all varicose branches and the ligation of insufficient V. perforantes.
In type III, thrombectomy over the V.saphena magna and/or parva duct has priority over all other measures.
Pachyderma is an acquired, asymptomatic thickening of the lateral portions of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
The disease is formally pathogenic and is caused by benign fibromatosis.
Based on my own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of coercive acts appear to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic-uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms include irritability, restlessness, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological failure.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute neuro-organic psychosis syndrome with progressive loss of consciousness to coma.
Initial cranial CT showed a discrete, generalized brain swelling that regressed independently of clinical deterioration.
The cranial CT was inconspicuous.
In the transcranial Doppler sonography, generalized increases in flow velocity were found (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides, and A. basilaris).
The causal link between river speed increases and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of river speed increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, elevated serotonin and platelet factor IV, and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
Continuous follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted approach.
Although the gold standard for the care of cruciate ligament injuries is replacement plastic, autologous reinforcement reintegration in adolescents is an excellent option.
We report a rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
The previous injury was blunt force trauma to the chest from a car accident.
A computed tomography (CT) scan was not able to diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs following blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be ordered to exclude life-threatening vascular injury, if possible.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and differ from them in some respects.
This brief presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a sound basis for his own practical work on many everyday but by no means minor problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma was treated with prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dose was 2 ng/ kgKGxmin over a 6-day incubation period.
Treatment resulted in improvements in inflammatory parameters, lung function, in particular diffusion capacity and marked acral circulatory dysfunction.
The elbow joint is considered to be the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view due to its central location.
Knee and ligament injuries in the proximal forearm area present a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems for the treating physician.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and restricted movement, inevitably reduce the functioning of the entire arm.
There is now little doubt that in the majority of cases, primary definitive osteosynthetic care with precise reconstruction of the joint surface is as indispensable for a satisfactory result as is early initiation of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical features of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current state of which is presented in this work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, complications with the electrodes can be fatal.
Manipulation by the patient of the subcutaneous electrode sections that can be felt through the skin may result in damage to the probe.
We're going to present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode insertion and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This medicine is a further development of mycophenol acid, which was already used successfully in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
This review describes the mechanism of action and pharmacology of Mycophenolate mofetil and summarises the current experience with this medicinal product in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology now offers the possibility of precise tomographic analysis of structures in individual steps.
The electronic memory can easily reconstruct image layers that cannot be represented by conventional techniques.
Surface and transparency modes also allow a visual representation of stored structures.
With these different imaging possibilities and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D ultrasound sets new standards in the diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After transient paresthesia, the accidental infusion was accompanied by burning pain in the legs, with motor and sensory innervation failure up to segment TH 11.
Complications such as these are usually due to errors, the occurrence of which, while not impossible, can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include colour marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions and the use of syringe pumps with a larger medicine reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The analysis of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology.
In order to make a fundamental assessment of the influence of jaw comb height and width, 95 toothless bony mandibles from collections that had been standardised sawed, measured and classified were first analysed.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implants were simulated at 269 cross sections and differentiated by implant type, cross section and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was used in 24 consecutive implant patients with toothless maxilla in the clinical trial.
Implantation on the jaw was possible in only 35% of the cross sections, but with sufficient jaw height in another 4.5% was actually expected.
Implant length reductions were required in an additional 6%.
The main dependencies were on the atrophy class.
The front cross sections offered much more favourable conditions than the rear ones.
In contrast, implantability was not demonstrated in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, and in 2 cases, a transverse alveolar ridge too narrow at sufficient height was not detected until surgery.
The results allow the quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimension.
This importance is primarily due to bone height, although even at sufficient height, reductions in implant length are often necessary.
However, both the cadaver jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and the patient (8%) still have alveolar crest profiles for which the height measurement alone falsifies the wrong proportions and may have to cancel a precisely planned surgical procedure.
The complexity and cost of implant rehabilitation and the impact of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require in principle extended diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
Since tumours have increased glycolysis, these can be detected by radio-labelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven successful in a variety of tumour entities.
In this study, PET was used in the staging of bladder cancer in the lymph nodes.
Preoperative PET of the pelvis was performed in 64 patients after IV injection of Fluoride Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) to compare the PET to the histological finding of the surgical product after classical surgical lymph node staging.
During lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly identified in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and a hit rate of 80% can be calculated.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than conventional staging techniques, such as CT and MRI.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect immunodeficiency in 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis.
Only 9 patients had subnormal immunoglobulin serum levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It affects the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/ or immunoglobulin therapy is necessary.
If chronic sinus infections persist despite conservative treatment, mucosal-protective sinus surgery is indicated, but this alone cannot bring the desired result in this disease.
An immune subclass deficiency should be considered as an indicator of a compromised immune system.
Transitions to severe immunodeficiency with development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old female patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of her torso and on her right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a marked reduction in lesions.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the 'adult bladder cyst' first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The maintenance of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resections has increased after the widespread use of nerve-sparing preparations and complete excision of the mesorectum.
Nevertheless, the literature shows post-operative rates of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence ranging from 25% to 67%.
Materials and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were imaged on 10 cadavers and 2 formaldehyde-insulated, isolated pelvic preparations.
Their relationship and possible sites of damage were illustrated and photodocumented during the surgical mobilisation of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically well-defined structures with little interindividual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense fibre network around the stem of the A. mesenterica inferior (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral wall of the rectum and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillier fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 shall not be isolated via standard surgical access.
The nomenclature of the fasciae and the course of the autonomic nerves in the pelvis are not clearly defined in the literature.
High levels of AMI withdrawal inevitably lead to damage to sympathetic nerve fibres.
The close relationship between the rectum and the autonomic nerve fibres makes a sharp preparation in direct view essential.
Fascia and nerves may be used as conductive structures in the preparation.
The selective conservation of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via the standard surgical approach.
Early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is important for prognosis and pioneering in therapy planning.
In a prospective study conducted from 1993 to 1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx and lip were panendoscopically staged to evaluate the possibility of early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
Endoscopic examination of the nasal, oro- and hypopharynx was followed.
The final examination was a micro-laryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspected areas.
The proportion of concurrent secondary carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precancerous lesions were also diagnosed by panendoscopy.
This study and two retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic and Polyclinic and the Regensburg Tumor Centre (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary cancers in a primary patient in the "head and neck area".
Based on the good experience to date and the uncomplicated outcome, it is evident that this examination does not create any additional risk to patients and therefore panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for the staging of head and neck tumours.
The diagnosis of Huntington' s disease can be very difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease, due to the high variability of the clinical picture.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's chorea, who for over seven years has had the psychopathological changes as her main symptom and has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic.
The exceptional and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis was the very early onset of the disease and the marked predisposition of the disease to other family members who had the disease.
However, the phenomenon of pre-implantation of disease onset is well documented in the literature for the case of transmission of the mutated gene from the father.
The pioneering differential diagnosis was the observation of the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed survey of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different emphasis:
The use of these therapies is not limited to the use of a combination of therapeutic and psychotherapeutic approaches.
Since different groups of patients benefit differently, indications for psychosomatic treatment are being developed:
This applies to the coexistence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated in dermatoses of psychological origin or involving psychological involvement, if depressiveness, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapeutic motivation are present.
In the case of problems in the treatment of the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant skin neoplasms, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
The following is intended to illustrate the importance of orthopaedic devices such as bandages and orthoses in the case of dysfunction in the lateral ligament of the hip joint.
The mechanisms of action of orthotics described in the literature in relation to joint stabilisation, injury prevention and influence on athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities are then explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene Müller-type pans.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of deformation of the polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion is measured by the displacement of the hip head in the pan.
Within the first few years post-operatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
It is inclined after about 5 years to values of 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0,2 mm per year are considered unfavourable for prosthetic loosening.
In this study, the centre of the hip head in relation to the pan marking wire was determined and head displacement calculated for a total of 369 hip prostheses.
After an average life of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had a rate of abrasion of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) used, this value was reached only in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The polyethylene-ceramic slip-on mating reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene-metal mating.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If patients with impaired capacity for consent are indicated for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the caregiver' s consent is required for the treatment.
The Landgericht Hamburg had based its decision on the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia on the basis of a well-founded risk of long-term damage to health and had approved the obligation to grant authorization.
However, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective treatment for depression and schizophrenic psychosis, subject to contraindications.
The use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive adverse events.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs very rarely and in a degree that is negligible in view of the risks of the underlying disease.
The authors argue that the adoption of a childcare law does not require the approval of a guardianship court.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is induced in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance by volatile anaesthetics and succinylcholine, among others.
The in vitro contractual test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH Group is the "gold standard" of the phenotypic diagnosis of the origin of MH due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) and the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and HD disposition.
After the C1840T (Arg614Cys) mutation on the RYR1 gene was detected in an individual from a large family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the correspondence with the IVKT was of interest.
The ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system disorders in the child are relatively uniform in sonography:
The initial symptoms are lymph node and organ enlargement, and disruption of normal echo texture, usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
The main patterns of infiltration observed on the parenchymal organs are as follows:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the bulky type.
The ultrasound shows a successful response to therapy by normalizing lymph node and organ size, returning normal organ homogeneity, and reversing tumor and inflammatory complications.
Differential diagnostic clues are derived from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, and, with some reservations, from the echogenicity and the dopplersonographically analysable estimates of blood flow.
The primary diagnosis should always be confirmed by histology.
Background and question.
Transitional acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, is characterized by clinically commonly itchy, oedematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papules, predominantly on the trunk, that spontaneously heal after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
In the case of still unclear etiology, light, sweat and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
