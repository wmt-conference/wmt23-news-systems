DESCRIPTION The C and C + + compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file's post-level name identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the post-sui name controls the default settings:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file and sets the connection in the form c,
g + + considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c + + file, and sets the connection in the form c + +.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and subsequent actions:
.c C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C + + source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C + + source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.CXX C + + source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed c files; compilation, assembly
.ii preprocessed c + + files; compilation, assembly
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source code; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other post-names are passed to the linker.
.0 Object file
.a Archive file (Archive file)
The connection is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process).
In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized file names (including specified .o H tag files and .a library files) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order they are in the command line.
Options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from' -d -r '.
Most of the '- = E: and' -W 'options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only the formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, explained in the following chapters.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Make it clear that the language of the subsequent input file is language (rather than the default choice that follows the filename).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered.
Turn off any explicit specification of the language, thus depending on the filename after processing the subsequent file RE AS E '-x' option).
Note that some combinations of options (e.g., '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF = c Compiling or compiling source files, ETER.ERA ATI By default, GCC can tell geo where to start by using the '-x' option (or Ah after the filename), and where to end by using the '~ -c', '-s', or '-E' option.
The target document.
After the compilation stops, no assembly is performed.
Pipelines are used between different stages of the compilation process, as assemblers on those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, GNU's assemblers do not have this problem, and assemblers can accept C "dialects": support for C programs conforming to the ANSI standard.
This will disable some of the key features of GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as unix and vax, which indicate that the standard library is suitable and rarely used, and disable the use of the main function, which returns an int, typically for almost all programs except the kernel.
For function declarations without arguments, such as' int foo (); ', it is handled in a C style -- that is, the number or type of arguments is not specified. (C + + only).
Normally, such a function foo in C + + means that the argument is empty.
From here, the section list was cut to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
For the NU c manual, we have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people will not be HERI.
For C + + programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.
It is the same as the result of the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but not the other effects of the '-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of '$' characters in identifiers (C + + only).
You can specify the -Efno-dollars-in-identifiers option to explicitly disallow the use of the '$' character.
(GNU C + + allows the '$' character on some target systems by default, but not on all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allows an implicit conversion (MEF c + +) of ant types to enumeration types.
Normally GNU C + + allows conversion from enum to int, not vice versa.
For example: -fexternal- - templates generates smaller code (limited to c + +) for template declarations, by making only one copy of each template function where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must tag '# pragma implementatio' (definition) or '# Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use templates.
When a program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates', the template instances are all of the external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved by typedef, which refers to each instance needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except for the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; this is the case.
-fcond-mismatch Allows the type of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to be mismatched.
The value of this expression is Void. -fthis- -is-variable Allows assignment to this (for c + + only).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C + +, the assignable 'this' appears out of place.
So, by default, this assignment is not valid inside a class member function.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can use the '-fthis-is-variable' option to make this work.
-funsigned-char Defines char as an unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type. It may be unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when it depends on the symbolic nature of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the machine on which the program is written).
This option, and its anti-semantic options, make the program work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.
If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a bitfield or unsigned bit field.
By default, bit fields are signed because they inherit a primitive integer type such as int, which is a signed number; however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings Stores string constants to writable data segments, and does not treat them differently.
This is in order to be compatible with some old programs, they calculate string constants is a very bad idea, the '-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
The impact may be similar to that of the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has stretched health services to the point of collapse, and restrictive measures imposed by Governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the epidemic is unknown and difficult to predict, but it is likely to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers who are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the ability of Governments to respond may be hampered.
The shift brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug addicts began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and shifted their use patterns to injecting drugs.
At the same time, Governments have cut drug-related budgets.
Interventions such as the prevention of drug use and associated risk behaviours and drug treatment services could be hard hit if Governments responded in the same way to the current economic downturn.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given lower priority, making it easier for traffickers to act.
Drug trafficking is expected to have the greatest direct impact in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled by commercial flights.
Synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, are carried by couriers in carry-on bags or hidden in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities, and the use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted owing to restrictions on air travel in almost all regions.
Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, trafficking through the dark web and the mailing of goods is likely to increase.
In the long term, the economic downturn and related closure measures could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and the lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders and turn to illegal drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to augment their ranks.
As the Government & apos; s response capacity declines, these shifts may quickly take root as a new reality in many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
Population growth patterns partly explain market expansion
Drug abuse has been increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of people who use drugs in the world population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, representing 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, there were an estimated 269 million drug users, representing 5.3 per cent of that population.
During the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth over the period, from 7 per cent in developed countries to 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group increased by 16 per cent in developing countries, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
Drug use is higher in urban than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.
The overall increase in drug use is due in part to the massive rural-urban migration, which currently accounts for more than half of the world & apos; s population living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
The increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is borne most by the poorest people worldwide, with drug use being more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine have stronger links with the more affluent regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among persons of lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug use and symptoms and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in the more affluent segments of society.
The economic constraints resulting from the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, had in the past been associated with an increase in drug use, and the epidemic had already forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
A pandemic that would lead to a further expansion of the drug market could lead to more farmers or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of State authorities is reduced or because more people may have to take the risk of engaging in illicit activities in the context of the economic crisis.
Constraints related to new coronary pneumonia have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased trafficking by sea, with a lower risk of interception by sea and a higher volume of smuggling than by air or land.
There have recently been reports of cocaine consignments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but potentially harmful new types of opioids are proliferating and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control, and the non-medical use of drugs has also increased rapidly.
There are approximately 500 new active substances on the domestic market of Member States each year.
Most of them are now stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small quantities of opioids.
While the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
New psychoactive substances for opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of new psychoactive substance types identified in 2014, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are analogues of fentanyl, and their efficacy and harm have been demonstrated to cause excess deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that new psychoactive substance stimulants are also injected in Europe: a study of remnants of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances with stimulating effects. & quot;
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly entrenched among vulnerable groups
A single class of new psychoactive substances has almost never created a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two States reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug producers to innovate. Many of the chemicals most often used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and & quot; ecstasy & quot; have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, the so-called & quot; engineered precursors & quot;.
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug producers dependent on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia was reported to have contributed to an increase in the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing fast
Replacement of opiates with synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate markets in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appear to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use decreased significantly.
But the stimulant market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
The Russian authorities reported that the number of clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs that had recently been seized had risen sharply, more than doubling in two years, to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern beyond Captagon and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than "phentermine" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities uncovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large imports of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have started in 2014.
Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing since then.
Seizures in the first half of 2019, however, amounted to 1 ^ 657 kg - a sharp increase from the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions legalizing non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased use of cannabis
Manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use was permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States.
In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use had increased since legalization, although a similar trend had been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis had not been legalized.
In the first two states in the United States, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly over the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the previous month.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also indicate that use is increasing as the legal market expands between 2018 and 2019.
However, in 2019, 40 per cent of cannabis users still had access to certain products from illicit sources.
Is the legalization of cannabis the reason behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures?
In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years, owing to a decline in seizures in North America, which fell by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled over the same period, and seizure patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect. The effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates for the use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances had decreased as a result of the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from licit and illicit drug markets Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are unevenly distributed across regions, mainly in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12 per cent of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population, but consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.
Obstacles to access to pharmaceutical opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescription practices.
Poor people are at greater risk of drug use disorders In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug use disorders.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk and exacerbate the consequences of drug use disorders, as evidenced by studies in high-income countries in which individuals & apos; adverse socio-economic trajectories are associated with the risk of drug use disorders not only with their condition at a given point in time.
Drug use disorders also contribute to the vicious cycle of disadvantage by deepening socioeconomic disadvantage and further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, which may also be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexual diversity groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster and persons in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or experience problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost as a result of disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on wider society has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with liver cancer due to untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high - up to 40 per cent.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to establish all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
The limited data available globally suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partly attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.
The links between drug trafficking and violence are multifaceted.
Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Recent trends
Cannabis use is the most commonly used substance, with opioids the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the harm associated with opioids has been neglected due to the small number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66 per cent were caused by such substances and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost as a result of disability or premature death from drug use were caused by such substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis was exacerbated by tramadol and in North America by fentanyl, two regions that had little in common in terms of economy, demographics or general patterns of drug use but were struggling to combat the opioid crisis fuelled by easily available and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two thirds of the 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Similar results were reported by Canada, although the figures were lower.
Fentanyl causes overdose deaths in part because of the unpredictable effects of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the non-medical market for tramadol has grown significantly.
In the region, a growing number of patients with tramadol use disorders are receiving treatment.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, peaking at over 125 tons.
In 2018, however, global seizures fell to 32 tons following the adoption of a new law regulating tramadol in India.
The crisis in both places is due to the simplicity and low cost of manufacture, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
The crisis in both places is exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their abuse more difficult to detect and prevent.
Growing use of stimulants
The field of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, of which methamphetamine was the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most available indicators, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demand of the same market.
Neocoronitis increases the risk for people who inject drugs
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drug use in 2018 and that about 10 per cent of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV and 5.5 million people are living with hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among injecting drug users.
The shortage of opioids as a result of restrictive measures against COVID-19 may lead users to substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.

European Union Summit on Refugee Policy Debate, EU Officials: Bottlenecks in the Acceptance Process - China.com
EU officials: Every step of the reception process is a bottleneck
At the latest EU summit, European Commission President Von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration as a way to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants, according to AFP on February 10.
The EU's move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core problem today is that the number of illegal immigrants who end up being repatriated is small.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has been arguing with member States over issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and thus speed up the construction process.
According to Euractiv, EU officials acknowledged that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities in member states were unable to prevent refugees from submitting "numerous" asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU's refugee reception system was in a near-" permanent crisis. "
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half that of the previous year.
Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this background, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can return illegal migrants to their home countries on the basis of a court decision in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders have reportedly agreed to "increase the use of the safe state concept," which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

US upgrade "chip war" hit the global semiconductor industry - ChinaNews.com
Recently, the US "chip war" with China has escalated - first the Netherlands and Japan agreed, under pressure from the US, to impose controls on the export of Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; and the Biden administration is preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries.
In recent years, the US has never stopped attacking the development of China's "core," while precisely cracking down on the semiconductor supply chain to China and building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to "get rid of" China completely in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is by coalescing South Korea into a "technology alliance," establishing a "quadrilateral alliance" of chips with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or creating a "small circle" of semiconductor chains through mechanisms such as the "quadrilateral mechanism" between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, or the "Indo-Pacific economic framework," the US is introducing the semiconductor industry through politicization, commercialization, and weaponization in an attempt to build a closed supply chain cycle led by the US.
However, the United States' highly publicized "core tactic" against China was to "damage the enemy by one thousand and eight hundred."
Recently, Pan Lin Group, a well-known US chip-manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plan to lay off 1,400 temporary employees over the next two quarters, in response to the latest round of export bans on chip-manufacturing equipment to China.
The global photolithography giant Dutch Asmaa Holdings recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in the price of semiconductors.
According to US media analysis, many US companies, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves, have been harmed by the US government's brutal crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries.
The United States claims that it is cracking down on China's advanced semiconductor industry, but it is dragging down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, the entire production process of semiconductor products takes more than 70 times across national borders, over 100 days, based on specialization.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it has a weak manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and is heavily dependent on the East Asian region.
Even as the US tries to steer the supply chain of advanced chips toward the US-led regionalization of "small circles," the regional distribution and interdependence of the world's semiconductor-related industries will be hard to change.
The United States has aggressively "reshaped" and "de-Chinaized" the semiconductor industry, devastating the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry requires the participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, such as the Innovation and Competition Act, the US Competition Act of 2022, and the Chips and Science Act, which use technological hegemony to strengthen the country's technological leadership, and "envy" to allies, forcing Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, striving to secure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the US did create problems and reap real benefits for China's chip and related industries.
But, in the long run, the hysteria of the US cracking down on China's chip industry, forcing it to break through and lose its huge Chinese market, will ultimately undermine the willingness and ability of US technology companies to innovate, and undermine the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension management products can be sold for a minimum of 360 days
The first personal pension management products on sale
Home 7 products of the body optional minimum can hold only 360 days
Personal pension management products are finally online.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the first list of personal pension management products, and seven personal pension management products of ICBC management, agricultural bank management, and China Post management were officially released.
At this point, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally collected four types of personal pension savings, personal pension management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to the introduction, the first personal pension wealth management products are all public class net value open products, of which 5 new products, 2 surviving products, except for one product is a mixture of products, the other 6 products are fixed income products.
The minimum holding period was 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, and the corresponding performance comparison benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70% -4.20%, 4.10% -4.60%, 4.40% -4.90%, and 5.25% -5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postal and silver wealth added to the shortest holding 1095 days 1," which is also a fixed income product, which started on February 10, and ended on February 19, with a risk level of 2.
Among the two surviving products, one is only the agricultural bank financial management "agricultural bank concentric · smart move" 360 days of scientific and technological innovation Renminbi financial products, the nature of investment is mixed, risk level is three.
The first issue of the magazine, titled "The Greatest Hits of All Time," was released on January 1, 2014, and the second issue, titled "The Greatest Hits of All Time," was released on January 1, 2014.
According to the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions, personal pension fund account funds can be invested in financial products such as banking, savings and deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The first personal pension fund products were launched, marking the official purchase of personal pension fund products by individual pension fund investors.
In November last year, the CSRC formulated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Money Management Companies.
The Measures provide that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public fund products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular stating that the individual pension system would be launched in 36 cities and regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Xiong & apos; an New District and Jincheng in Shanxi Province.
By the end of 2022, 19.54 million individuals had participated in individual pensions, 6.13 million had paid contributions, and the total amount of contributions was RMB 14.2 billion.
Previously, participating banks listed only three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension funds.
Now that personal pension products are available, what choices should investors make?
According to the National Institute of Health (NIAH), there are three types of health insurance products: Medicare, Medicaid, Medicaid and Medicaid.
One is robustness, with more robust risk management mechanisms, more robust investment strategies and concepts, and independent trusteeship of non-parent banks.
The second is long-term, with the duration of the pilot phase of the pension management products being five years or more, and the personal pension management products to be issued in the next phase having a minimum holding period of one year in principle, with a minimum holding period of three years or more being encouraged.
The price of the product varies from $1 to $0.01, depending on the type of product and the price of the product.
Professionals point out that investors choose according to the characteristics of the product and their risk tolerance.
Individual pension savings have the characteristics of long maturities, high interest rates and high safety, suitable for people with low risk tolerance; individual pension insurance products are more suitable for people who cannot afford investment risks and can accept stable returns; while individual pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee capital or returns, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk tolerance.

Fitness industry should get out of the crisis of confidence - china.com
Another Big Gym "Thunder"?
Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of healthy members in well-known fitness facilities has attracted social attention.
Many of the members found that their stores did not operate normally after the Spring Festival, and rumors about the closure of the agency caused panic among the members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human society departments.
In the end, the organization's leaders responded by promising to work to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members.
When some of the stores of individual fitness facilities have run into operational problems and are temporarily closed, and consumers can sit back and wait for the problem to be solved, why do so many members "first reaction is" something bad. "
Behind the controversy over the rights of health club members is the deep problem of a crisis of trust in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "making money that users don't get" is the underlying logic of their development.
In order to obtain cash flow by pre-selling membership cards, new stores are opened constantly, and it seems that the circulation can be repeated, but it is not possible to create a stable profit pattern.
Negative messages from the industry, such as running gyms, have a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, the gym is certainly a good business with a "money trail."
The track has always been a capital concern, even though it has risen and fallen.
Many studies have shown that the consumption of food and beverages is increasing, and the market continues to warm.
Specifically, in the fitness market, with the steady improvement in the living standards of the population, the concept of healthy living has taken root in people & apos; s minds, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to focus on the quality of development.
However, individual institutions were blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, and had just emerged from the crisis, blowing the trumpet to open up new territory, and invested a portion of the financing in the construction of new stores.
In the past few years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the industry, and many companies have been forced to relocate or relocate to a new location.
However, in order to enter a virtuous cycle of fitness market development, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by making steady progress and rebuilding consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Rather than building a new store to dominate the market, the fitness industry now needs to calm down to optimize services and secure users with high quality development.
First, it is important to retain users through services.
It is a service industry that insists on "user orientation," focusing on user needs and focusing on service quality improvement.
Second, digital transformation will enhance the user experience.
For example, the popular Internet Gym model allows users to pay on a pay-per-use basis and choose a venue.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively used to meet social needs, enabling a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without private marketing, and without huge annual cards, users "concerns about the" run-of-the-mill "of fitness facilities are reduced, and trust is increased.
There is also a need to actively explore a variety of business models.
Today, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scenario consumption, and the health club is expected to become a new entrance to consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness will become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buying the Difference!
Reproduction of the property market in Nanjing "difference payment" - 中新网
According to the New York Times, the New York Times reported that the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the New York Times reported that the "New York Times" and the "New York Times" were "not the same."
There can be a number of conditions for a "premium agreement."
The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Suyuntai, and the house watchman, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" while walking around the property last weekend.
For example, in the case of a property purchased between 1 February and 28 February, the purchaser of the property is entitled to a refund of the difference in the price of the property if the price of the property is less than the price of the property purchased in the previous period (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, in the same building, in the same unit and in the same property).
According to Mr. Sun, the real estate consultant said that it was a "price insurance agreement" in fact, the purpose is to make the buyer feel safe, do not worry about the development of the company's price reduction promotion, "I am afraid that it will be reduced when I buy it, I will not go to the sales office and I will not be able to do it."
Many homebuyers believe that the "premium agreement" is a "pill" for homebuyers, but the terms are not too low.
According to the New York City Department of Housing and Urban Development, the price of a home is the same as the price of a home, and the price of a home is the same as the price of a home.
Some buyers also argue that because of the asymmetry of information, the sale does not exclude the granting of additional concessions, making it difficult for buyers to "defend their rights."
It remains to be seen if buyers will be retained
Reporters in Nanjing online real estate inquiries learned that the property was sold in November last year for a total of 252 apartments in the two buildings of the chief, housing area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., all renovated and sold at an average price of 39,843 yuan / m2.
However, more than two months later, online real estate showed that the total number of unsold units in the current property was 157, or 62.3%, of which the total number of unsold units in Building 8 was 128, or 113, and the total number of unsold units in Building 7 was 44, or 33, or 13%.
It was also announced that a "free" version of the game would be released in Japan in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang West Park on the Hexi Huangshan Road, introduced the "Insurance Plan," the specific content of which is "the company solemnly promises that if the preferential margin of the project is expanded within a year, the resulting difference will be refunded to the old owner."
In April 2011, nine properties in Nanjing pledged to pay the "difference payment."
"The market is warming up," he said, "and now we need a strong shot."
According to Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, the "premium agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of housing companies.
He argues that today's developers need more confidence than homebuyers, and that the introduction of "price premiums" is actually giving them a boost.
As for the ability to retain buyers, he said that it depended on a combination of factors, such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which remained to be seen for the time being.
Taiwan's economy underperformed in the first year of recession - CNN.com
Xinhua News Agency Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) Export trade volume "five consecutive black," manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) contracted for seven consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) also see "three digits"...
Analysts believe that Taiwan's economy has fared poorly in the first year, and that there is little pressure to grow.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year amounted to US $31.51 billion, a decrease of 21.2 per cent annually, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The value of exports for all 11 major export categories declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment and the deepest decline, respectively, 37.6% and 35.7%.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1 per cent annually, the largest decline in 11 years.
This was the largest decline in the industry in 14 years, with an annual decline of 18.3%.
The director of statistics for the sector, Cai Mei-na, said that this showed that the consumer electronics industry was entering a correction period as a result of the diffusion of weak demand.
Statistics show that imports and exports from Taiwan fell in January, with an excess of US $2.34 billion, the lowest level in the past three years.
According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline in exports in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected, as a result of the decline in global terminal demand, industrial adjustment of inventories, and the decline in exports.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Chinese Economic Research, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for seven consecutive months, with a seasonally adjusted fall of 3.3 percentage points from last December to 40.4% in January.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI is set at 50% of the boom-bust line, and the index is greater than 50%, representing economic expansion and contractionary contraction.
In January, the five components of the PMI in Taiwan saw a contraction in new orders, production and employment, a decline in delivery times for suppliers, and a contraction in inventories.
The six major industries, in order of their rate of contraction, are the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%), and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
According to a report by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the annual growth rate of the CPI in Taiwan was 3.04% in January this year, and has broken the 3% mark again since July last year.
Of these, vegetable prices soared by 28.25 per cent, a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's "master planner's office," admitted that the price increase was indeed more than expected, and that the average CPI in January and February of this year should be close to 2.71% of last December, excluding the Chinese New Year factor, and inflation pressure still exists and is still high.
This year, the Taiwanese economy is expected to see a combination of reports from the United Daily News, Yahoo Finance, and other local media outlets.
According to Wu Daoren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's Chung-Ang University, a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of default.
At the same time, reduced orders cause manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impinges on consumption capacity.
According to a report by the Institute of Economic Research in Taiwan, Qiu Da-sheng believes that the inflation situation in the United States and Europe is not clear this year, and demand continues to shrink, and it is expected that the decline in exports in Taiwan will continue until the first half of the year.
As the economy of Taiwan is supported by exports, the annual economic growth performance will be lower than the previous year due to the impact of the export downturn.
"An important engine of global recovery" - ChinaNews.com
"In the face of the pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown great resilience.
Recent market expectations suggest that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and an honorary advisor to China Policy Watch, said in an interview with this reporter that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Ríos said that in the face of various unexpected shocks, China responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening-up, the endogenous driving force of economic development is increasing, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in tandem.
Every year, two national meetings are held to discuss the country & apos; s development agenda and topical livelihood issues on behalf of the members, and to build broad consensus, people & apos; s hearts and minds, so as to add strength to China & apos; s development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development, and has now entered the stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China & apos; s wisdom and China & apos; s proposals, and to China & apos; s development bringing new opportunities to the world.
According to Ríos, China is now vigorously promoting scientific and technological innovation and injecting new impetus into economic and social development, "with capital investment, personnel training, and policy incentives, which will keep China vibrant in the new five-year plan."
For Rios, economic structural reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has taken proactive measures to stabilize its economy by exploiting the advantages of both the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system.
China's strategic focus is to expand domestic demand, strengthen financial support for the real economy, support the development of the private sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and manufacturing industries, and adhere to innovative development, promote employment, raise the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the people's multi-level and diverse consumption needs.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
The unlocking of China & apos; s economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Ríos said he hoped that the Belt and Road cooperation would continue to play an important role in improving the level of infrastructure in each country and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and that it would continue to unleash greater momentum.

With the emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how can "content be king"?
- China New Network
February 11: China's electricity supplier industry emerges "new variable," with goods how to do "content for the king"?
China New Finance Reporter
"We were late to join the E-Commerce, but from the very beginning we realized that it was important to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fang Fang, a girl from Guangdong, now runs a nutritional food store in Douyin, allowing an offline store with a history of more than 30 years to "bloom" online.
The song is a parody of the original song, and features the same lyrics as the original song, but with a slightly different lyrics and a slightly different sound.
At a recent event called "Looking for Partners and Quality Content Sharing," Fang Fang spoke as a representative of quality creators and introduced the experience and experience of daily creation.
She said, "The video was well received by many users, and many people were interested in my food and wanted to cook it with me.
"
Fang used the video to make more people fall in love with the "old taste," a live stream to sell up to 300,000 nourishing food, to save the old store on the verge of closing.
"No content, no e-commerce," as short video and live commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new phase.
In the early days of live streaming, live studios often attracted users with low discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been a number of notable individuals and businesses in the area of vertical subdivision, such as Liu Xihong and Oriental Selection, who have improved their long-term business performance by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand tone.
According to Gao Yaxian, the head of operations for the star author, over the past year, 6.27 million creators monetized their content through the service, increasing their content creation by 252% and more than doubling their total transaction value.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving, vibrant author's ecology.
"Kaufman says."
The Beijing Normal University Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform previously released the "Electric Business Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report," which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - quality content in the current electric business industry from the data dimension, and used the index to assess the ecological situation of the content of 27 domestic mainstream electric business platforms.
According to the report, the E-commerce industry ranked in the top five in the ecological health index of the content of the E-commerce industry, Tianyin E-commerce, Express, Taobao, Jianduo, and Jingdong.
According to the report, the e-commerce content ecosystem is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, and good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user original content) are the best carriers for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenario, the higher the possibility of e-commerce insertion, the greater the commercial value.
On the spot, Professor Yu Guoming of the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University, Chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, gave an analysis and interpretation of the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to "consumer quality," and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content became the basis and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (Key Opinion Leader), etc. PGC content began to become standard in e-commerce live streaming.
Looking ahead to the future of the electricity industry, Metsä made two recommendations.
One is from the perspective of improving the content structure, to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a balance between the index and the dynamics of the e-commerce industry & apos; s content ecosystem.
The other is to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value of the external environment from the perspective of the external environment.
"The e-commerce industry in the future also needs more data, artificial intelligence support to form a forecast for future development stability; in addition, to provide a more standardized and healthy growth space for businesses, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry value synergy, to create healthy content ecology."

中华新聞报: Promoting Chinese Modernization as a Systematic Project - Four Treatises Deep Understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping in Learning and Implementing the Party's Twenty Great Spiritual Workshops
Beijing, February 11: Promoting Chinese modernization is a systematic project - Four theories deeply understand General Secretary Xi Jinping in learning and implementing the Party's 20 major spiritual workshops
Xinhua News Agency commentators
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires comprehensive consideration, systematic planning, overall promotion, and proper handling of a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practice exploration, strategy and strategy, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up.
At the opening of the seminar of the new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to learn and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the Party's Twenty Great Spirits, General Secretary Xi Jinping grasped the laws of modernization construction scientifically, and explained in depth and systematically a series of major relations that need to be handled in practice, providing scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization involves all aspects of economic, political, cultural, social and ecological civilization, including Party and military governance, internal affairs, foreign affairs and national defence.
The top-level design requires a deep insight into the general trend of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, an in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, and a system of planning and policies that reflect the times, grasp the regularity, and are rich in creativity.
China's modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many uncharted areas that need to be boldly explored in practice and promoted through reform and innovation.
The strategic question is the fundamental question of one party, one country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to strengthen the foresight of the strategy, to foresee the future with a scientific strategy, to lead the future; to strengthen the overall strategy, to focus on solving the major problems related to the success or failure of the Party and the national cause, and to strengthen the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it is necessary to stick to it for a long time, to grasp it, and to do well.
It is important to understand the dialectic relationship between strategy and strategy, to combine the principles of strategy with the flexibility of strategy, to be flexible, to adapt, to make decisions on the spot, and to take the initiative in the strategy according to the local situation, to act according to the situation and to follow the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
In dealing with the relationship between integrity and innovation, we must not only maintain the essence, source, roots and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unwaveringly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, respond to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively promote reform and innovation, and fully stimulate the creation of vitality in society as a whole.
Efficiency is the essential foundation of equity, and fairness is a powerful guarantee of efficiency.
We must modernize in the Chinese way, both to create greater efficiency than capitalism and to maintain social equity more effectively, so that efficiency and equity are better balanced, promoted and harmonized.
We should manage the relationship between efficiency and fairness so that development can continue to be achieved for the benefit of the people, development depends on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit all people more equitably.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to manage the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both vibrant and stable and orderly.
It is necessary to coordinate development and security, implement the overall concept of national security, improve the national security system, enhance the capacity to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of State power, institutions, ideology and key areas.
In addition to giving greater consideration to security in development, enhancing national security through development, and consolidating the foundations of national security through the use of development results, China is also adept at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating the vitality of development and achieving a virtuous interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
In order to promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only follow our own path, but also broaden our vision of the world, adhere to opening up to the outside world, and constantly expand the scope and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We should adhere to the principles of independence, self-reliance and self-reliance. We should place national and ethnic development at the centre of our strength and firmly hold the destiny of our country & apos; s development and progress in our hands.
We should continue to expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, participate deeply in the division of labour and cooperation in global industries, make good use of domestic and international resources, and expand the development space for Chinese-style modernization, so as to share development opportunities and create a better future through mutual benefit and win-win results.
If you follow the path, you will be far away.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, grasp the rule of law, persevere in our efforts, give full play to our initiative, initiative and creativity, and properly handle a series of major issues.
On Friday, the Biden administration blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
It is difficult for blacklisted companies to obtain United States technology exports.
The list is known as the "entity list," and companies on the list cannot purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they have a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Sky Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group 48 Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkun Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between China and the United States, and US Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his visit to China.
The United States shot down the balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government lodged stern representations with the United States Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously impacting and undermining the efforts and progress of the two sides to stabilize China-United States relations.
Based on available evidence of the wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the balloon's manufacturer was "directly related to the People's Liberation Army" and was an approved supplier to the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and stated its position on the incident of a Chinese airship strayed into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolution of the United States Congress was purely political manipulation and speculation.
China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement, said: "Today's action shows that we are working together to detect and stop China's use of spy balloons, which violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
"
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has yet to comment on this information.

A few days after the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, the hope of finding survivors is dwindling, but the five members of the family who were rescued on Saturday are a source of great relief for the searchers.
According to the Associated Press, in the town of Nourdai, a heavily affected area in Gaziantep province, the family of five was rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
The searchers pulled the mother and daughter out of the rubble and then found the father, who insisted on saving his son and another daughter.
When they were all rescued, there was a cheer in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also rescued in severe weather conditions.
"What is today?
The boy, who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, was brought back to the ground and asked his rescuers to rescue him.
A man from Kahraman Marash holds his recently rescued cat
The miraculous success of the rescue effort gave light to an already hopeless search and rescue effort, but at the same time the number of people killed was rising.
According to official figures, Monday's earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey and an estimated 3,500 in neighbouring Syria.
Although experts suggest that people can survive up to a week after being trapped in the rubble, the prospect of finding more survivors has become increasingly remote.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to look for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, relief efforts began to focus on helping those in need.

Google AI chatbot "wrong answer problem" parent company's stock price evaporated $100 billion
(11 episodes).
Google's new AI chatbot, Bard, suffered a "wrong answer" in a promotional video, causing Google parent Alphabet's share price to fall by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and losing market capitalization of $110 billion (RM476.5 billion).
The market is worried that Alphabet is inferior to its competitor Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Bard was asked, "What can I tell my nine-year-old child about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
Bard replied that the telescope had taken the first images of an extrasolar planet.
However, according to NASA, the first images of extrasolar planets were taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2004.
Reuters reported that "Alphabet's share price plummeted after Bard answered the wrong question."
On the other hand, Google noted that Bard's response "underscores the importance of a rigorous testing process," combining external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, safety, and truthful information."
Strong Singapore tourism recovery 19 times more inbound visitors than in 2021
According to the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of international visitors to Singapore is expected to reach 12 to 14 million in 2023, bringing in about S $18 billion to S $21 billion in tourism revenue.
In 2022, the Singapore tourism market will gradually restart and recover.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of inbound tourists increased 19 times from 330.6 million in 2021 to 6.3 million in 2022, surpassing the Board's earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million, and the number of visitors has returned to 33% of the pre-pandemic level.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totalled S $8.96 billion, with annual tourism revenue expected to reach S $13.8 billion to S $14.3 billion in 2022, a six-fold to seven-fold increase from S $1.89 billion in 2021.
The Government of Singapore has taken a number of steps to accelerate the recovery of tourism.
In April 2022, the government announced the allocation of nearly S $500 million to stimulate tourism recovery.
The Tourism Board has recently announced that it plans to allocate NZ $110 million from this budget over the next two years to introduce more business and leisure activities to attract return visitors.
To make health and wellness one of Singapore & apos; s tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a call for ideas on 23 November 2022 to develop a health and wellness destination on Singapore & apos; s southern coast.
Ling Li Wang, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists had put health first.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in Marina South, with its Gardens by the Bay and the coastal dykes, is expected to contribute to Singapore & apos; s tourism and economy, allowing visitors to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Tan Keng Lung, Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that health and wellness would become an important part of Singapore & apos; s tourism products in the coming years.
The outbreak has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programmes to the local public and international visitors for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health and Wellness Festival, which provided the public with more than 130 health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Central Beach Market, the new "Explore the New World" exhibition hall at the Museum of Arts and Science, and the new amphitheatre at the Night Safari, the Tourist Board will support the development and renewal of the Bird Park at Wildlife World to make Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
It is planned that in 2023, Singapore will develop relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the MICE industry, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore & apos; s tourism industry has accelerated the airline industry & apos; s recovery.
Data show that as of 18 December 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with up to 150,000 passengers per day and about 1 million passengers per week, which is about 75% of the pre-pandemic level, and the number of employees in the airline industry has returned to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Between January and October 2022, Singapore received 23.6 million passengers, or 42% of the pre-pandemic level, and 170,000 flights, or 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery in tourism has also spurred a recovery in sectors such as accommodation, transport, restaurants and shopping.
The Government of Singapore and the tourism industry have high expectations for the Chinese market.
The Assistant Director of the International Division of the Singapore Tourism Board said that a survey by the China Travel Platform showed that Singapore ranked in the top three in the world for safety, which was one of the reasons why it was so popular with Chinese tourists.
Prior to the outbreak, about 3.6 million people traveled to Singapore each year.
As China relaxes its border policies, the number of Chinese tourists is expected to return to 30-60% of 2019 levels this year.
According to Ke Shudan, the Tourism Bureau will closely monitor further signals from China's outbound travel policy in response to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms such as Ctrip and travel agencies, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in travel outside China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that tourism will recover faster than expected as long as there is no significant downturn in the global economy affecting public revenues and no more major outbreaks of deadly disease.
Kim Jong-un's father-daughter interactive intimate wife gets snubbed
In North Korea, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army was celebrated on the evening of the 8th, with Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Jong-un, not only attending but also standing on the podium with her father.
The film was released by the North Korean state media on September 9, and the owner of the money snuggled up to her father, looked at him with affection several times, and whispered, she held her father's cheek with both hands, even touched the father's chest, and the father and daughter interacted with each other throughout the country.
First Lady Lee Xuezhong, however, was forced to step aside.
In the official photo of Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol Ju at a dinner party with their daughter Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-un not only rarely sits in the middle C of their parents, but also sits on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary military parade the next evening.
The Korean Central Television (KCNA), the official media of North Korea, later released a military parade video, revealing more of the affection between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter on the podium several times, and the smile on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears, and Kim once loved his father's cheeks with his hands, and Kim responded with a smile.
Other state media accounts also show Kim Jong-un sitting on an indoor sofa with Kim Jong-un, touching her father's face with her hands; and Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands as she walked with her father.
First Lady Li Xuezhong could only walk or sit in the back, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
According to the South Korean media, Kim's exposure has increased in the past three months since the first public appearance of the Mars 17 missile on 18 November last year, and it is now the fifth official appearance.
It was also the first time in the history of the United States that the use of the word "child" was used in reference to a child, and the use of the word "child" in reference to a child was used in reference to a child's love for a child, and the use of the word "child" in reference to a child's love for a child.
According to the Washington Post, "this is a sign that Kim Jong-un is pushing his daughter of secondary school age to the position of successor," although some have argued that this is too early and that various possibilities remain in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knee.

Q: How do you view the US non-farm payroll data for January and the outlook for investment?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released data on non-farm employment for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm jobs, significantly exceeding market expectations by 189,000. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.
In aggregate terms, the data are subject to a number of one-off and technical disturbances, such as staff returning from strikes, a revision of the survey's statistical calibre, and an update of the seasonality factor, which may be revised (referring to the January 2022 addition of non-farm workers, from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm employment, or not as strong as the data suggest.
Structurally, the impact of job cuts in high-tech firms is still present, but relatively low; new jobs in high-touch services, such as leisure hotels and education and health care, have rebounded sharply, and data suggest that the service labor gap remains.
Combined with the similarly better-than-expected service PMI, the rebound in job openings and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced a quick fix after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the United States job market will not improve without a recession.
With more than five million supply gaps in the US labor market, the labor-force participation rate has been slow to rise, especially among 25-54-year-olds, who are nearing pre-pandemic highs.
Moreover, strong consumer demand will cause the impact of austerity on the job market to lag further, owing to excess savings and strong consumer credit in the United States.
Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will underpin the US economy in 2023.
With the superposition now nearing the end of interest-rate hikes and repeated inflation expectations, we are not optimistic that wage growth will continue to decline.
Prior to the release of the data, US stock bond markets had been overly optimistic about the Fed's interest-rate hike path.
As inflation data continue to improve, the Fed is shortening the pace of interest-rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but markets have turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, anticipating not only an early halt to interest-rate hikes, but also two rate cuts by the end of the year.
With labor market supply and demand tight and the impact of austerity uncertain, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance for interest-rate hikes is relatively reasonable, and that the market's extreme expected adjustments and trading congestion may hurt the market somewhat.
Nonetheless, the persistence of wage growth is unlikely to reverse the current rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turning negative year on year and leading CPI indicators gradually improving, and the US CPI data having shifted to a rapid decline since October. The persistence of wage growth will only underpin future inflation data, and current market expectations will be hard to disprove, and the market will enter a new round of games once inflation data are released.
"中国服务第一股份有限公司新闻网" (in Chinese).
On February 11, 2014, the WeChat public number of the subject of the certification was released as an obituary, according to which the founder of the company and chairman of the board of directors of the company, Zheng Yonggang, died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65, due to a sudden heart attack.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang became the director of the state-run cotton mill, and in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of the Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, which was the predecessor of Cedar Corporation.
In December 2022, in a speech at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Future Stars, Zheng Yonggang stated that in the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand in the Chinese suit market was up to 37%.
In 1996, the company was listed on the stock exchange (600884.SH), becoming the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.
In the middle of the day in the clothing business, Shanshui Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, the Chinese brand will naturally form a caucus-style brand market, Shanshui suits want to have been unique, long-term national clothing is unlikely."
In 1999, Shisui began to study corporate transformation, Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai, looking for what to do in the end of the transformation, specially recruited a lot of experts and scholars, continued to hold a number of Zhuge Liang meetings, retreat seminars.
Finally, we have set two broad strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the second is great health and the future. "
After the strategic direction was determined, Sugi began to look for cooperation, at that time Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy for Angang Institute of Carbon Research was doing national 863 project, research funding was insufficient, so Sugi and the Institute of Carbon Research of Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy signed a cooperation agreement to promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engaged in the development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, to achieve commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, the company began to produce intermediate carbon microspheres on a large scale, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate carbon microspheres.
It is China's first manufacturer of lithium ion battery anode materials, and has achieved the localization of lithium ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid spread of the use of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugiyama Corporation began to gradually develop, and in 2007 the lithium material business was written into the main business of Sugiyama Corporation, and the revenue share of the clothing business decreased year by year, until 2013, the lithium material business of Sugiyama Corporation exceeded the revenue of the clothing business.
In February 2021, the company successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Sugikin Optoelectronics, which has a high technological content in the field, and the main competitors of Sugiki are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung Korea, Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, "Chinese private companies acquire some high-tech companies internationally, the probability of success is relatively low, why do those acquisitions fail?"

"Fund E Account" is coming: SFC authorizes development investors to aggregate and query all funds under their names - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
Is it difficult to collect account information because of the multiplicity of channels through which the Economic Observer Network purchases Chen Shanshan Fund?
Always Forgetting the "Little Vault"?
These problems of the people are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the SFC announced that the "Fund E Account" app would be listed on mobile app stores and open trials would be conducted.
According to the report, "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the pain points of industry services such as forgetting accounts of small and medium investors and making inquiries.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there are 156 public fund managers in China, the size of the managed fund is about 26 trillion yuan, 167 public fund share registration institutions, and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The accounting systems of the various quota registries are independent of each other, and there is a lack of industry-wide access.
According to industry sources, by the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the people in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to check their purchases through different sales agencies, but through the "Fund E Account" they could check their purchases across all sales channels and see how their funds were being held at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to the relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a Chinese settlement approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to develop the construction of the public fund industry portal mobile application, which can provide investors with a one-stop inquiry on the holding of the off-exchange shares of public fund products in the whole market.
Through the "Fund E Account," investors can easily and quickly grasp the holding status of the over-the-counter shares of each fund manager's public fund products purchased through various sales channels throughout the market, thereby improving the overall efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the "Fund E Account" provides investors with access to information about fund accounts opened with public fund managers across the market, trading accounts opened with public fund distributors, and the holding of off-exchange shares in products such as publicly offered securities investment funds and pooled asset management plans that do not limit the number of investors set up and managed by securities companies to 200.
According to Liu Yiqian, head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, investors can learn all their OTC funds' holdings through the "Fund E Account" app in one stop to help them recover their "forgotten assets," and more importantly, to achieve a comprehensive fund investment information collection for customers, to help customers more timely, accurate, and complete understanding of their own investments, so as to better optimize their portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
How is it registered?
According to the press, the "Fund E Account" app has been listed on mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the app is still in the public trial stage, registration requires filling out the invitation code, and investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold.
A customer service staff of a medium-sized and large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to the Economic Watch reporter, and told the reporter, "During the trial run of the APP, China settlement provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager.
At the end of the test run, the invitation code is no longer needed when the open user is enrolled.
"
The process takes only a few minutes and consists of four steps: user registration, real name verification, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name verification step, click the "Assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through each fund sales platform are displayed in the binding option list (binding account), and after completing the binding, you can visually see the total assets of the fund invested and start using the query function.
It is important to note that Fund E accounts are only available for investors, not for foreclosure.
The date of the data shown in the "Fund E Account" is generally the date of the user's query (T date) forward by three trading days.
For example, if the "Fund E Account" is opened on February 10, the total assets, fund share, and fund net worth shown on the assets page are rolled forward three trading days to that date: February 7.

Reaching Defense Consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines
February 9 - Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visits Japan to meet with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's aggression in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantial defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to the Japanese media, Kishida hoped that the meeting would help the Philippines and Japan establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and was awarded a $20 billion deal.
But since then, Sino-Philippine relations have not improved, but rather declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The new base is 300 kilometres from Taiwan and is the closest site to China.
In the event of a crisis in Taiwan, the US might launch an operation from a base in the Philippines.
The Japanese media now believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, as well as the Philippines, have formed an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the Chinese Communist Party" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
中国人民共和国政治家情報〜夏立言之旅〜 (in Chinese).
Xia Liyan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, met with Song Tao, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Wang Huning, member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang's official organization, the National Political Foundation, gave an interview to the Taiwan Central News Agency last night, commenting positively on what Song Tao said to Xia, as long as he agreed with the "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomed the Green Camp people to visit the mainland.
The party claims to be a new party.
This was not mentioned in the news on the day of the meeting with Song Tao.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan (DPP) refused to accept the "92 Consensus."
According to the Central News Agency (CNA) today, the Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to Beijing, where they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
According to an interview with the Song Tao Council, the political basis of the Communist Party of China was the "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, and Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang's National Administration Foundation, said in the meeting that the "92 Consensus" of the Kuomintang was the original "92 Consensus."
Zhao Chunshan's analysis was different from that of previous conferences in which he participated.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of students who have not yet graduated from the university, and there has been an increase in the number of students who have not yet graduated from the university.
As a result, the Chinese government decided that the two sides should work together to improve relations between the two countries.
Because of the lack of mutual trust between the two peoples, the other side is still willing to work well with the Taiwanese people, and the representative does not want the relationship between the two sides to deteriorate.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao to "implement what they (the farmers and fishermen of Taiwan) have requested," and if it is not possible to solve the whole problem, it should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang's visit to mainland China directly mentioned the daily harassment of Chinese military aircraft and warships in Taiwan, the farming and fishing problems of a small number of counties in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency interviewed such questions.
French trade unions once again mobilize anti-Government pension reform marches
On Saturday (11 February), French trade unions again launched a national campaign against the Government & apos; s draft pension reform, calling on the population to take to the streets to express its views.
This was the fourth day of action in the social wave that opposed the proposed reform of the Government & apos; s pension system.
The number of people who responded to the call to assemble may influence the next course of action for the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight largest trade union groups in France have jointly launched a national mobilization, and the first time that a rally has been scheduled on a Saturday.
Given that, for most French, Saturday is a public holiday and they do not have to choose between participating in a protest or a wage strike, the trade unions hope that today's rally will attract more people.
Neither the Metro bus system nor the unions of the public railway companies called for workers to go on strike today; the bus system should be operational, citizens could travel to the meeting place by car, and in areas where schools were starting to take winter vacations, people could go on vacation normally.
The trade union group hoped that more than a million people would attend the rally today, while the police expected between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide, and 90,000 to 120,000 in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the start of the anti-government protests over pension reform, the number of people who actually took to the streets has declined, although polls show that most French do not support a move to raise the mandatory retirement age from the current 62 to 64.
The first strike on 31 January brought together between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
Demonstrations on Tuesday (February 7) have shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million across the country.
This pension reform is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the radical left-wing groups, have submitted numerous proposals for amendments, so that the review process has moved slowly.
The debate between the two sides is becoming increasingly heated.
A member of parliament from the radical leftist French Insurgency Party recently posted on social media a picture of himself walking on a balloon with a picture of the Minister of Labour, provoking protests from the ruling party.
The President of the National Assembly eventually announced that the member would be barred from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a penalty for such acts.
Despite the fact that this reform programme has generated the largest social movement in France in more than 20 years, the Government has so far made no significant concessions, although it has made some adjustments to the draft.
The trade unions are ready to take action again next Thursday, 16 March, and on 7 March, when the draft reform is tabled in the Senate, they are planning to organize a demonstration.
China encourages high fertility rate to universities to donate high quality
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province in China issued a promotion on 9 September to solicit donations of sperm from college graduates or current students, and successfully donated 8 to 12 times to receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to media reports today, the message hit the Weibo hot search that day, and triggered a follow-up initiative in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to the Freedom Times, China encourages college students to donate money.
In addition to academic qualifications, the school also requires a height of 170 cm or higher, good five senses, no obvious hair loss, and a myopia of no more than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province stated that sperm donors could receive a full male medical examination worth 1,000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome testing, which most people have never done, is important for understanding their own fertility status."
The donor must be at least 165 cm tall, have a college degree or above, or be enrolled in a school, have a weak color blindness, or have a genetic or infectious disease such as hepatitis B, etc.
According to China's Tianmu News, the Shaanxi Human Sperm Bank printed a poster of "paid donation of sperm, unlimited glory," calling on young people to respond to donation of sperm, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages, "Let love pass."
For example, in the United States, a person who is eligible to receive $5,000 in cash and a person who has completed a certain number of donations can receive $5,000 in cash.
The highest known price is in Beijing, where a subsidy of up to 5,150 yuan is available.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany has died.
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement to the party, "Last night Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party lost an important leader.
"
On 13 November 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, the Communist Party leadership was forced to step down as protesters throughout East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
Mikhail Gorbachev called for change in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe after the rise of the Soviet Union.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the election, he ceased to be Prime Minister.
Despite Modello's reforms, his opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for attempting to reshape, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but was not imprisoned.
These allegations are alleged to be politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament from 1990 to 1994, and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old GDR to return, but that the GDR's achievements should be acknowledged.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon commander in the youth fire brigade and, towards the end of the conflict, became a member of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final war effort.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in the social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and between 1973 and 1989 he was promoted to chairman of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED).
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Hackers in Iran to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution in support of the protest took a presidential televised speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised address by President Ibrahim Lehi.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted for about a minute on the Internet, and a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, named "Edalat Ali," appeared on the screen.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic."
Iran commemorated the anniversary of the revolution, according to a Reuters report today, and hackers cut off state television coverage.
As Iran officially marks the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, the hardline government of Laithi faces the most daring challenge from the young protesters demanding their removal, but Laithi still calls for "deceived youth" to repent so that they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Following the death in September of 22-year-old Amini Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's moral police, nationwide protests continued to rage in Iran.
The deadly crackdown on protests by Iran's security forces is one of the most formidable challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500 year monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, the Iranian authorities released on Friday the imprisoned dissident Farhad Maisami and the Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who had been on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had issued an amnesty that included a number of prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
According to HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
A further 70 Government security personnel were reportedly killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote at Saturday & apos; s rally to demonstrate opposition to the protests and support for the Government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media displayed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, shouting "Allahu Akbar!
God is the Greatest! "
However, many people could be heard shouting "Dictator to die!"
"The Death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television aired live footage of official gatherings in all states of the country.
In Tehran, home-made anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were on display as part of the official celebrations.
President Lacey's speeches were often interrupted by the slogan "America to the Death" - the hallmark slogan of state rallies.
The crowd shouted "Death to Israel."
According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
In 2020, she was sentenced to five years in prison on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Messami's release, supporters warned that he was at risk of death because of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the mandatory wearing of the headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including by allowing her to return to France if she wishes."

Is the Balloon Event Brightening America's Eyes?
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the US was prepared to tighten its technology exports to China further after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials have said that the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China, and that they will seek greater political support for increased US technological protection.
The United States claimed that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works at the Center for New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This is certainly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of the hardliners."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners."
U.S. officials said that they had informed more than 30 governments about the balloon incident, and that international coordination was essential to deal with the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that, in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the newly established US House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party could pressure the US to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She said that members of Congress would be under increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of tighter export controls are also pushing for broader controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing an OFDI review program to examine whether there is a potential national-security threat from China to US investments abroad.
Analysts say the White House may be faced with calls for the plan to be rolled out more quickly.
Turkey earthquake relief around the clock
Since the devastating earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked day and night in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In cold temperatures, they often call for silence, as they struggle to hear any sound of life from the crumbling concrete piles.
Reuters reported today that two more women were rescued days after surviving in the rubble of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake rose to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighbouring Iran.
A similar powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that rescue workers rescued two women trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years from the ruins of a collapsed building in Turkey.
Another wounded 55-year-old man, identified as Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in south-eastern Turkey.
In cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence as they struggle to hear the sound of any life in the dilapidated concrete piles.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescue workers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered "Inshallah" - "God bless" - as they carefully stretched their hands into the rubble, rescuing a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images show that the emergency personnel also took away his mother, who was dizzy, pale and alert on the stretcher.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and that 31,000 aid workers had been mobilized in the affected areas.
He said that some 80,000 people were treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people had been rendered homeless by the earthquake and were crammed into makeshift shelters.
With many people lacking food in cold winter conditions, the response of the leaders of both countries to the disaster was increasingly questioned.
According to official Syrian media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife, Asma, reportedly for the first time since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria due to the state of war complicating relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdoğan visited the Turkish province of Adıyaman, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as rapid as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdoğan, who will run for re-election in the May 14 ballot, but may be postponed because of the disaster.
According to Reuters, anger over delays in the delivery of aid and the start of relief efforts could affect the elections.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge in Erdoğan's two decades in office.
Erdoğan called for solidarity and denounced what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
Turkey's main opposition leader, Kemal Kilidaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was massive, but more serious than it was was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence."

Hanoi - During his visit to Brunei, Prime Minister Pham Minh Quang and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) on the morning of 11 February.
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research centre in Brunei and the third largest in the region.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
The University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University of Vietnam in July 2013, mainly in the area of English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, Moral Education, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei Darussalam has incorporated Vietnamese into its curriculum.
During the visit to Brunei University, the Prime Minister of the Government of Viet Nam, Pham Minh Thanh and his wife had an exchange with the students of the Vietnamese language class.

Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language faculty at the University of Brunei would grow stronger and that students in the Vietnamese language classes would become increasingly interested in the Vietnamese language, work hard to learn it, become fluent speakers of the Vietnamese language at an early date, and become ambassadors of the friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh also took the opportunity to communicate via video with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT - UBD Global Center in Da Nang to learn about their studies, especially during the epidemic.

What was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Mysterious, speculative
On the afternoon of Friday (10 February), the United States military again shot down an unidentified object over Alaska, using the most advanced American stealth jet, the F-22.
The shootdown took place 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.
This was the second time the United States had shot down an aerial object in less than a week.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted in US airspace for days before it was destroyed near the US coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 metres (40,000 ft), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also considered that there was currently no indication that the object was manipulable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator, said on Friday that while the exact nature of the high-altitude object is unknown, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Kirby stated that the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
Kirby said, "What we call an 'object' is the best description we can make so far."
President Biden, who had listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, was "very careful" in making the decision, Kirby added.
The official U.S. description of the object can be roughly summarized as follows: it is about the size of a car, has no joystick, has no suspension, and flies at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information does not yet answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what tasks it is carrying out.
There is much analysis and speculation online that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It is likely that, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, it came from China and carried out some sort of mission in different locations.
It has also been linked to the "UFO" in Alaska.
The report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as saying on Twitter on Friday, "I wish this' UFO 'was also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of mixing an alien craft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth starting an interstellar conflict," said Major.
Major made the tweet shortly after Kirby confirmed that the Alaskan object had been shot down.
According to Newsweek, it was not just Major who suspected the object was a UFO.
Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, criticized the government's efforts to conceal intelligence last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "UFOs."
Amazon's customer service attitude makes me hard to believe
I don & apos; t think many people have seen this, but I would like to say a few words.
It was a zipped hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short sleeve that I was given.
As soon as I received the clothes, I contacted Amazon customer service and confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer service said to fix it, and immediately saw that the product name had changed to a short sleeve, and the link I had bought had been removed.
Then the customer service notice either keeps the goods for a certain amount of money or returns them.
Is this the Amazon approach?
Believe it or not, it was not my fault that my clothes were faulty, and as a consumer I asked for the goods I was entitled to, without making any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed its name and said that it had no stock.
This is my first long comment, and I hope it's not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
The sleeves of the jacket are usually longer than the sleeves of the jacket, but they are usually 1-2 cm long, and the arm should naturally hang in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of the jacket are covered with fingers.
Clothing is easy to buy and easy to return.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes worked well, because the size was too small and had to be returned, but after the return, more than a week has passed and no refund has been received?
And the purchaser himself had to contact the untrustworthy Quanfeng courier, which was the worst purchase he had made since buying an Amazon item!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the prompt courier to refund in time, but the real work of this Quanfeng courier is done quite angry, and it takes about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag the back of Amazon, work inefficiently, not service consciousness!
Better for young people
99 Seconds.
The color, texture, and texture of the trousers are good, soft and medium in thickness, and do not taste like kerosene.
Unfortunately, the form is thin and more suitable for young people.
3 XL, with a tiled waist of 2 feet 5 inches, with a maximum stretch of 4 feet, 1.79 / 80 kg wearing a slightly tighter waist.
It seems that the waist is not tight, and it is difficult to increase the waist.
In addition, the close-fitting clothing was uncomfortable.
Very good color is not very bright
More than two hundred of them were sold, which is what happened.
The first time Amazon used a co-op courier, the first time delivery was not at home, then the initiative and the courier arranged two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, then returned it directly to me, the damned courier did not have any good faith at all, it is strongly recommended not to use that courier every day.
This time a T-shirt was also returned to me, and the price was raised by more than a hundred dollars.
Amazon itself should not appear such goods
If the product is sold at a low price, it is also a good product.
I was stunned when I actually received the product, the surface of the product was worn out, there was wear in many other places, whether it was a defective product or an old one, as shown later.
I asked for a return, and the manufacturer looked at the picture and said that it was the result of the shipment. Isn & apos; t that nonsense?
How can the interior of a commodity be worn out?
There are only two possibilities, one is that the product is defective, the other that I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively, I have no proof that I have not damaged the product, but based on my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I do not think that such a product should appear in Amazon's own products, customer win, we win, customer win is the manufacturer's victory, thank you for your efforts to improve.
After less than a year of using the product, there were two E2s. I don't know what to do with them.
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the red E2 was often seen on the right side of the receiver, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not consistent with the 7 years of continuous operation of the transmitter module on Amazon's website, and there is no aftermarket on Amazon's website, now I do not know what to do?
All right.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was broken.
And always the white screen.
"It's all right.
The exchange is quick, the night is a bit blurry, the perspective is not very wide, but the ordinary household is enough.
There is no need to buy a card, buy one yourself, or buy a cell phone from Amazon.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, this time no, there is also a sticker like a sticker when buying a mobile phone, which can be attached to the warranty card, this time no.
I don't know if it's cheap or not.
Waiting for supplier response
There is no sign on the package, call the supplier directly and say that the answer is not marked as genuine, such as suspected scrap mail to Johnson & amp; Johnson inspection, leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & amp; Johnson warranty card, and have not received a text message yet?
Oil was received in the morning and changed in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are very reassuring.
It is said that the oil is clean and good.
Because it was the second purchase.
So it's still very safe.
The delivery was fast, the package was not in a picky place, the oil was used, and the engine sound was noticeably reduced.
Good value for money, it is difficult to find synthetic oil below 200.
Support for the Star Crown, support for the winning card, and effective protection for the car.
Amazon in Japan seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c = 14cm, 8c = 2c)
Admitting the error, but always prevaricating, always emphasizing that the goods were third parties and could not bind them.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I bought the page size options 7c, 8c, and 9c, I thought it was a trap, called Nichia's customer service and told them clearly that 8c was 8c, but when the product came back to China, I found that it was only 8cm, which I thought was just a deliberate trap set to trap the Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales service).
Chinese customer service: I am sorry, we have caused you a loss, we have given you two ways:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
If you do not return it, we will reimburse you 1,000 yen.
(I checked the account, shoes 4000 yen, 200 rmb, choice 1, I do not have shoes, I lost 200 yuan.)
The second option, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2,000 yen, finally lost at 150 rmb customer service: We have recorded it, we will take it seriously, the next day I returned to the mail, saying that I do not accept Chinese customer service mediation, and that's it.
When I suggested the confusing option of buying pages 7c, 8c, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me by saying that Japanese common codes do not carry c, like 140, but did you go to any other caterpillar pages?
There is a common misconception that there is a common misconception.
Also, why do you put 8 cm between 7c and 9c, and what do you mean by the smallest size?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we do not know that you are going to return home, so we do not pay for your freight.
I don't understand this logic anymore, I'm Japanese, I want Chinese customer service, China living in Japan does not need Chinese customer service, I go to Japan as a tourist, I don't have that kind of kung fu to call international long distance, then the question comes, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, it's nothing like me.
Didn't Amazon's Chinese customer service make it easier for those of us on the Internet?
This purchase is not very satisfactory
This was the second time that Pampers diapers had been purchased from Amazon, having bought a box of diapers from European paper when the baby was two months old, and the first purchase was satisfactory, as the baby used a diaper all night and did not change the diaper for 12 hours.
For example, in the case of the "L" diaper, there are two separate bags of diapers, and when the bag is opened, it is felt that the paper is looser than it should be, and there is no sign of a rash or urine leak after it has been used for babies.
However, after the second diaper bag, the baby's inner thigh developed a red rash, which has not yet subsided.
There are two cases where the quality is not the same.
No more purchases should be made!
I want to pay attention to the transport protection of the package
It was the worst package shipment I've seen in a long time, with no protection at all, no cushioning foam, no parcels of cushioning material, nothing.
A box of compressed deformation.
Also, the soft plastic box inside is packed, and the card box is pressed open until it is deformed.
The quality of the product is guaranteed, and it is no longer possible to purchase anything from Amazonia.
It would be better to have half the domestic cost and have a point of security.
And the packaging of commodities, as I see it, was commented on in 2016, 19 years now, is still the same.
It is important to note that Amazon does not pay much attention to service feedback, and it is far from being home to the likes of Jingdong and Tmall.
Pretty, but a little sorry
The color of the cup is my favorite, orange, although my family is a man's treasure, but I think that orange and yellow are bright.
It was smaller than I thought, but it was supposed to be brought out, so it was acceptable.
When he returned home last night and tried it, the cap was pushed open, and the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was perpendicular to the top of the cap, so the son always had to hold the top of the lid and drink water, thinking that the place could be improved.
It seems that other brands of suction cups still make sense to tilt the straws, and children's things are really about safety and comfort.
Lightweight, large capacity
I like it because it's light, it's big, it's two separate pockets, it's kind of superfluous for me, I don't know what to put in.
It was found that there was another similar brand on the overseas purchase of the United States of America, which was worth less than two hundred dollars.
Fake, especially fake
Amazon sells fakes, and I wear them.
The customer service said they could not return it because it was used, and I did not know how to know that it was a fake.
In the end, it turns out to be a good idea to buy something, to buy it, to buy it, to buy it.
As a result of this, I have no choice but to submit it to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform.
Bad?
Fake?
In short, tragedy.
This is the first time that a person has been shown to have a strong sense of smell, but it is also the second time that a person has been shown to have a strong sense of smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, smell, etc.
There is no longer any doubt that it was the same as the previous one, and it is now in its infancy.
It's a little bit like the smell of poor-quality scalding water.
Is it unthinkable that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided?
What a mess.
In this case, the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service, and the customer would be asked to pay $100 for the service.
Feeling after use
For the first time in the history of the world, there is no doubt that it was the first time in the history of the world that a person was born, and that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that it was the first time in his life that he was born, and that he never died.
Anyway, I think this is really good.
The second order was placed from number 27 and received in number 12 for a total of 15 days or half a month, and Amazon's delivery service was excellent.
Third, don't believe in a black Friday on Amazon, and place an order on Friday and wait for two days to get close to $12, which means I buy more than 170 (plus shipping and so on).
What the customer service said about the price fluctuation, I focused on the price for more than 10 days just like that, and the fluctuation was small.
Affordable, made in Japan, labelled in Chinese, with granules, absolutely buy back!
There are a number of different types of teeth, some of which are very smooth, some of which are slightly thicker than the rest of the teeth, and some of which are slightly thicker than the rest of the teeth.
As a result, Amazon will no longer be able to sell its products.
To give you some advice on how Amazon's apps can sometimes get sunburned, how to improve some apps, how to do better and better!
Excellent years, getting worse, no quality of service at all!
Special delivery time 19: 00-22: 00 when placing an order regardless of customer needs.
It is only at night when there are elderly people in the house who are inconvenient to sleep in after surgery.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 o'clock, without any advance notice by telephone.
If the delivery time is as short as your courier wants, why take the time to let the customer choose?
If their own logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not become an electricity supplier!
Let an old man with three wounds get out of bed and open the door to the courier for a change!
There is a telephone number on the order!
No one called to explain!
The so-called complaint service is a group of outsiders who pretend to be there, amplify your complaint and then give you a so-called reply.
There will be no change or compensation!
I've had this kind of problem with delivery times before, but this time it's too much!
After the sale of the new book, the front cover and back cover are reversed, so it is obvious that the quality of the book will be closed to the customer.
No one will be able to contact you.
Excellent years, getting worse, no quality of service at all!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
Image quality is really unacceptable
As a title such as "Ancient Atlas," the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, layout, and printing of the images, some of which are even mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if the book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent ancient documents left by the ancestors in the catalogue!
(And many of the images can be obtained from relevant industry sources with clear raw documents.) What is the difference between piecing together a book with such images and not using them?
I'm very sorry for that kind of academic attitude.
There is no way to tell the difference between the two.
2 stars.
The second book I read in high school was just a boring look at the state of mind, and I felt that the book itself should not be addicted to it, after all, the beginning of the Internet was not very attractive to me.
And then... it fell into the pit.
The book is generally considered to be the best book of the series, as it was written in the early days of the comic book series, although it is not as well known as the first book in the series.
As for the part of the game, I wrote a little bittersweet feeling of the change of the times between the old and the new (probably my sentimentality).
It took me a lot of time to read the book, but I couldn't stop.
The characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place, and the characters are often portrayed in a way that makes them feel like they are in the right place at the right time, such as when they are in the right place at the right time, or when they are in the wrong place at the right time, such as when they are in the wrong place.
On the other hand, there is no such thing as a full time job on the Internet, which is generally criticized as 30 million or more beautiful or corrupt, and the feelings of all of them have one thing in common: they like to glorify the game, and most want to win.
There is no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and cute.
Perhaps that is why there is no annoying role to play full-time.
Full-time IP is big, thanks to that.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of the Internet, a full-time job is a good book.
How much he really gives people some hot blood, a little touched.
In April of this year, full time will be animated.
In fact, I've been trying to buy this book for a long time, because it's not always thick enough, and when I wanted to buy it, I found that it was a fake on tb, but in fact, a full-time recent version has come out, and I like the cover picture, but I'm going to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought it at once.
Then briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
The fourth book has no seal, but the book is new.
In the 17th century, there was a need for a new style of writing, but this was not the case in the 19th century.
:: The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but very old.
:: The publishers of individual books are different, as if 23 and 17 were the same publisher, and different from others.
:: Overall satisfactory, 24 boxes, very satisfactory.
The Lonely Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner," and the result was a lot of text!
After reading the book three times, he read it to the children, a little lion who can shoot, and a little lion who loves juice candy.
When the lion eats the hunter, it is a little uncomfortable, and the modern city people do not accept this arrangement of eating animals.
In the end, the lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself and was no longer a full lion or a full man.
In the end, only the back of the lion remains, and it is not known where he went.
Perhaps years later, the image of the lion remains in the memory of a grown child, who may be touched or inspired by an inadvertent recollection of her one day.
Cost-effective collection of works
I don't know if it was the first time, but I think it was the first time that I was able to do that, and I think it was the first time that I was able to do that.
The largest edition, like the complete Michelangelo collection, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle edition is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this edition is the smallest of the two, with a book box.
It was also acceptable, as it was cheaper and more than 700 pages split into two, which could be easily read as a paperback edition; secondly, unlike the complete Michelangelo collection, which was dominated by paintings, the manuscript in black and white by Leonardo da Vinci was the majority, and the edition was the best value for money as an appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts for budget-constrained, non-art readers.
The painting part of the explanation is excellent, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I do not know whether it is printing or book size problem, some of the shadow parts are too deep, I can not see the details, I am a little sorry.
In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, the latter is a wide range of achievements, is not enough to be a genius.
If only half of the Leonardo da Vinci paintings had been seen, the manuscript would have been completely lost in language.
Garbage, who buys it and repents!
Never give a bad opinion, this real garbage, buy a waste of money, give a reason!
1. When the time is not right, it suddenly becomes 1 January, and the time goes to zero.
2. A low-quality belt, none of which is made of silicone, with an allergy to the wrist and blisters.
3. often not connected to the mobile phone.
4. The flight lasts only five days.
5. Sleep tests do not show that the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow

Courier delivery is so bad that Amazon is already slow to buy things, and I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfactory
In the beginning, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was fine, there was an inflatable bag inside, the camera was consistent, it was also possible to register on the official website, the number of fast doors 0, the rest can only wait for the time to check.
It was not long before I heard the sound of the door opening, and I could not help but feel that the door was open, and that the door was open, and that I could not open it in front of him.
Merchant before shipping for the sake of the customer:)
The business was more responsible, calling specifically to ask for the screen size of the camera used, and indeed for the customer & apos; s sake.
Delivery is also fast.
It is also a good place to start.
Battery charge dissatisfaction
The machine is really good, I want to ask how to charge for the first time, I am dissatisfied, the charging indicator is red
There is currently no official Amazon feedback channel, so feedback can only be provided in product reviews.
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for $31 through pre-order, indicating that the March 31 issue would be pushed to the device, at which time the book could not be previewed on Amazon's official website (as it had not yet been released).
2. The book, which was sent to the device on March 31, is blank and only to be expected, while the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to $18;
In the second half of the book, it is revealed that the book is not available on Amazon's official website, but is available on Amazon's official website.
Now I have a few thoughts.
The question of the price is not really the most important, the key is how to replace a blank book on the kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever.
2. The books purchased in advance should not be purchased again, after all, in the event that a ticket is skipped and a book with an empty content is downloaded, the procedure appears to be very complicated;
For example, if you have a question about an e-book download, or if you have a question about the use of an e-book download, you can give a local feedback (either a ticket or online customer service, see how the Microsoft Store works).
Not very recommended to read
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it after reading it with my memory.
The book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of life's love.
The book's tone is extremely plain, like that of boiling water, and the words are the ultimate pursuit of simplicity, and the plot is as quiet as the streets of summer afternoons.
Each short story is a brief sketch of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
The final collection was titled "What We're Talking About When We Talk About Love."
I think that this collection of novels, and its title, like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only a sad discord on the stage, a dry stone in the urban legend, but also a love that is not only above but should not be represented, love is also a life as flat as water, boring day after day, there is also a uncertainty about life, reality escape, and the future.
When you read the book, you may think of a couple quarreling next to you, an awkward marriage with someone you know, and an unhappy feeling.
That's why I don't recommend reading it, and from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and the plot are boring, and unless your life is stormy or sweet enough to live in a candy castle, you have to read it as if you were bored. "
And, in terms of the depth of thought, the everyday plot does not brighten or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Márquez's Love in the Cholera), and the short clip does not explore any issues, such as what mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed through techniques and genres rather than storylines, which explains the poor reading experience of the book.
Suitable for rough reading, can not take a closer look.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not plentiful.
A lot of sales theory is explained what and why, but in terms of how to do it is very weak, just pointed out the direction but do not give specific practice.
In addition, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.
It is not known whether the story was compiled for the sake of example, but it would be more convincing to cite some of the authors & apos; personal experiences.
In the customer or the name of the customer to change.
The title is still the customer, the text becomes the customer.
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering in e-books.
In short, this book is a good introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales.
A quick introduction to Internet Finance
The book is shallow and can be said to be just an introductory course that can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to know more about it, you have to find it and dig it yourself.
In addition, the book was written earlier, and the content of the later Alipay WeChat to cultivate user habits through the subsidy war has not yet been mentioned, and the third party payment share is not as small as it is said in the book.
Many of the people who went out to eat had to bring a mobile phone, and the bank had to abandon the use of UnionPay due to the high cost of the bank.
However, it is also important to note that the author of the book is very knowledgeable about the history of financial development both in Japan and abroad, as he has at least many years of experience in financial observation, so he is able to write such easy-to-understand content.
It is easy to write and easy to understand.
Admire you, and let you know!
The first factor in determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of pay, but whether or not they are sufficiently valued and appreciated at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after a person's basic survival needs have been met, the most pressing need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most people, it is "hard to love you in your heart," and even with love, gratitude, and appreciation, it is silently unspoken.
In the book, the author describes five types of language of appreciation: positive words, careful moments, acts of service, gifts of gratification, and physical contact.
What I think is important is not that you know what the five languages are, but that you can appreciate them from the bottom of your heart, anytime, anywhere, and be grateful to those around you, whether they be family, friends, or colleagues.
The closer we are, the more appreciative and grateful we are, and the better our lives will be.
The Society also appreciates the extent to which companies can retain talent and reduce the rate of resignations.
Thanks to the translators who brought us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.
Due to the cultural differences between the two languages, it is believed that the authors of the original texts would have gained more if they had had a chance to see them.
Again, thank you to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected of counterfeit goods, review them carefully.
Super poor quality, loose packaging, no weight, even worse than roadside stalls, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; Amazon's worst shopping experience, has applied for a return; is a matter of quality; advises merchants to polish their eyes and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: bought another heart print, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, added a few comparative photos to further verify the falsity of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further discomfort!
Once again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous about the source of its products.
There is a gap between slack products and expectations
Advantages:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: Both the motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC and are OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.
Disadvantage:
There is no charge indicator, and the most basic of your power instructions are omitted, and the customer who buys the estimated $300 product is also a charity in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC.
When charged with a strong odor, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, it can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
One day, the whole room was filled with plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS of the same price range that I used before, this product, Panasonic, the quality is really sorry for the consumer.
Small packaging
It is also possible to see that the product is more or less identical to the original product, and that the product is more or less the same as the original product.
"'복면가왕' 동방신기, 3 주연속 1 위... 이상수상수상, 이상수상수상."
The store has a long history of selling and selling goods to supermarkets.
The Purple Sauce.
I don't like it.
The children do not like the taste of toothpaste, and each time it is hot, it may be better described by another word, which is temporarily the only word in the child's vocabulary.
It's a good idea to buy four stars, but they're not going to buy any more.
This is a good idea.
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there is no online review except for the bare appearance of a product.
There was also a layer of plastic film on the bottle's outer packaging, as shown in the picture, and the courier was quick to arrive the next day.
It is not known when it was sold, but it is known when it was sold.
A terrible shopping experience
For example, in the case of a person who has been in a relationship for more than five years, the relationship between the relationship and the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, the relationship between the husband and the wife, and the relationship between the husband and the wife.
Wrong layout
I thought I would receive a headphone like Figure 1, but I received a headphone like Figure 2. What does it mean if the figures are not consistent?
Although the names are the same, I hope that you will be careful and ask Amazon to change the correct layout in time, thank you very much.
Operating system General
For a while, the overall picture was fine, and I didn't feel any difference, except that the system was tangled, booting time was obviously a bit slow, and the software that came with it didn't have to be commented on, and the response was more general, and it wasn't an order of magnitude better than that of my colleagues.
When I look at the reviews, it's a very human design, I don't find where I'm humanized, and the remote control, which is usually up and down and left and right, returns to the position of the key design is really not flattering.
So, just be a TV, add a TV box and so on.
The price reduction is too great
The price has dropped so much that it is now 99!
A lot of unreviewed orders have accumulated on Amazon, so I use a copy of the same passage as a review.
If I use this phrase in my evaluation, it means that the product has a score of at least 85.
I would never be too lazy to copy and paste a bad product, so that other consumers can use it as a reference when they buy it, and so that the seller can improve the quality of the product.
Good line, no fever is enough!
Such a cheap line, but it should meet the hdmi certification standard, personally compare the killing domestic Akihabara these dog-farting toys (the price is twice as expensive), the wire body is thick, soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, later the low line is considered to be double!
Something is fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really far worse than other websites.
After the order was placed, it was discovered that a mistake had been made, but the order could not be cancelled, and the website contact online customer service always displayed the wrong link and could not be contacted.
The delivery man called me, and I said I didn't want it, and the person who wanted to cancel the order didn't succeed, so the delivery man took it back and said he'd sign it and ask me to return it.
If the customer does not return the product, the customer is not allowed to return the product, and the customer is not allowed to return the product.
I had previously bought items in Jingdong and Suning that cannot be returned according to the policy, including milk, diapers, etc., contact customer service has been returned, and Jingdong's diapers have been opened and the taste is too big to contact customer service has been returned, you can not go to Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how do you deal with it?
Tell me whether I should take it myself, or let the dispatcher buy it himself, since it would not be easy for someone else to do so, why should I ask someone else to pay for something they did not buy themselves?
Okay, I'm not going back, I'm taking it myself, but I have to give you one point for your service
Don't Pay Money
In the first place, if you look at the packaging, you can see that it is good, but there is a box that is basically soft and soft, and the appearance is not visible, you have to feel it, eat it in your mouth completely without taste, you have no taste, you bite the pulp a circle is dark yellow or bad, it is good or bad, you can eat less than a third, you are advised not to buy it, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Eat a dime, and never again buy fruit from an online store!
What Is The National Debt Limit
The depression at the bottom of the bottle should have been caused by a strong impact, and the degree of devastation felt in the overpack is heartening, after all, the packaging of the food is too simple, it is international, there is no visible anti-counterfeiting sign, the bottle is easy to open, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, the opening is almost not sticky, is it the same for foreign products?
I was born in China and I don't understand.
Should it be genuine?
This was the first time I was abroad, and I just wrote down my doubts, maybe it's normal?
Delivery services to be improved
In the first round, the contestants were given five minutes to choose from, and then three minutes to choose from, and then three minutes to choose from, and then the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options; the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options; the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options, and the contestant was asked to choose one of the three options.
Good shopping
Good Luck!
For example, in the United States, it is more common to buy goods from Amazon than from other countries, and to buy goods from Amazon within a few days, so it is more common to buy goods from Amazon than from other countries.
It was hoped that the quality and prices of domestic goods would be better, and that many of them would be domestically produced, but it would be cheaper to go out and buy them back than at home, and it was hoped that improvements would be made.
Garbage
When you look at this package, ask: Do you think it's garbage on the roadside?
Is it responsible for a fragile plastic package that comes in a plastic bag from the so-called Germany?
I see such packaging as rubbish, buy this product, it is in a rudimentary packaging, without any protection against breakage, it is in a simple plastic bag, and when it is in hand, the package is completely deformed and the contents are damaged.
If I just come across one of these, I recognize it, I buy several of them like this, I look to Amazon customer service, the customer service says that I can refund, but the shipping fee is advanced, and the shipping fee is returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I ask you, I paid for the shipping in cash, and you gave me back the gift card, and I was asked to buy your gift card myself and say it, and to mail the product to a German warehouse myself, and it was not a crime to buy a product!
And I've been saying to the customer service, who is responsible for such a problem, the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, they do not dare to take even half of the responsibility, what is the guarantee of such after-sales service?
5 stars of good quality and poor logistics
1. Good quality, good price, good value for money.
2, strong, with sufficient material, solder joints are firm, the surface treatment is correct, the color is very good.
3, logistics is hard, 3 under the single, 11 to arrive.
Fourth, I would have been happy if Amazon had not indicated that the expected delivery date was February 7.
5, but indicating the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving a promise to the user, when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is uncomfortable.
6. If you do not give the assurance of commitment, please do not make a commitment.
7, in fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchants.
8, so I got a low score.
the gold thread will fade.
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
It is not a good thing that the gold line was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold line will fade and be placed in the car, if you touch it a few times, your hands, and the car, there will be some gold powder.
Hope the product can be improved.
It is not uncommon for a car to fall off the ground and fall onto the ground, causing damage to the car.
Things in good condition, speed, 2 parcels in different packages
For example, in the case of an 8-bit integer, the number of bits in the array is the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array is the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, the number of bits in the array, and the number of bits in the array.
Aran mattress is really good
A 34CM mattress is not usually thick, so it is not necessary to place the bed directly on the mattress.
He is very good at both the front and back, very soft, sleeps well, and quickly falls asleep while lying on top.
After receiving the mattress, there were two stains on the courier's violent transport, and Arran's customer service was very responsible and efficient in contacting them to resolve the problem.
It's Not Self-Made, the Amazon is shameless
It is the responsibility of the seller to ensure that the goods are delivered to the buyer, and the seller is responsible for ensuring that the goods are delivered.
I want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, I can not cancel; I want to return, I have successfully applied for a return at Amazon, I'm sorry, there is no one to take care of you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return.
This is the first time I've seen it.
The product is not Amazon, Amazon does not pay, the customer service says "I will help you contact the supplier," and claims that it is self-employed, too shameless, too naked, too naked to cheat on the consumer!
A depressing experience
The filter, which was previously purchased on the Internet, was well filtered and used for another day or two after the end of 28 days without scaling.
This is the first time that I have been able to buy a filter in Amazon, and it feels so good, not only has the scale started early, but the filter has been used for 28 days, there will be a little black carbon floating, I do not know if I will continue to use it or throw it directly, it is very depressed.
Not as good as I thought.
Compared to the wiring boards I have used in the past, the exterior work is common, and how the interior is not opened, but as described by the shopkeeper, from the point of view of ease of use, whether each independent unit is energized or not
The packaging was damaged and time was allowed to check the quality of the product.
The outside packaging is damaged, the box inside seems to be new, but the instruction manual seems not to be new, it was renovated in September, it was stocked in the hope that it will not be bad, please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the package was damaged, but you can rest easy, thank you!
Generally good, a little problem
The first time I bought a water filter, I read a few review articles, I felt that the cost of LAICA was higher than this, I received the goods according to the instructions, I loaded the filter, I tried it, I felt good, but when I poured water, it seemed that the raw water would be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank sealing is not too strict).
When you use it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
Picture incomplete
There is no detail on the side of the picture, and the detail on the side is very different from the style of the subject, which is one; this bead is from Thailand, which is not indicated, which is the second; the texture is not indicated, which is the third; when I bought it in England, it was clear that each item had a box, there was a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the bead, so I could tell if it was true or false.
It is important to be careful about what you buy, especially if it comes from Hong Kong.
Amazon Customer Service
The order was received two days ago and found to have dropped $40 today, and it took a lot of time to find the customer service, who said that they could not make up the difference and could buy it again and return it.
This customer experience and service than a Bao Dong really ten thousand times worse.
Well, as a novice, it is worth starting
It was the first time I had ever played in a major league, and it was the first time I had ever played in a major league, and it was the first time I had played in a major league.
It's a good thing.
It was really good, I sent it to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not in Canada Express at noon, the logistics company put it in the mail deposit and did not send me the verification text of the pickup, I ran two times.
It's really good.
Worth buying
The next day, the little monkey, who is cute and amazingly powerful, delivers the package directly from the official website, and the order was placed the previous night, and received it this afternoon.
Postal couriers are also responsible.
Praise!
Confession of a customer
1 After receiving the defective product, Amazon customer service will tell you not to rush, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service agent, who will tell you that the matter will be dealt with by the commissioner, who will inform you of the outcome.
You never actively contact the commissioner, you never know her job number, you never have a direct telephone line, you never contact her, she only contacts you.
Tragically, I waited for nearly three days, and the commissioner contacted me, and I left my cell phone for a while without receiving a call from the commissioner.
I waited for two hours and did not wait for the call from the commissioner, during which time I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
Four days have passed, and I still don't know what will happen to Amazon if I receive this faulty coffee machine!
There is no problem with the products of the United States Amazon, and purchasing from overseas is a good way to go, but it is far worse than the services of the United States and Asia.
6 For me I can only continue to wait...
The Bottom Line
In this case, it is important to note that all of the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the original recipe, but it is important to note that the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the original recipe, and that the ingredients in the recipe are very similar to the ingredients in the recipe, so the ingredients in the recipe are very different.
I don't know if I was lucky enough to get the bottom of the pot, but I was lucky enough to get a month's return service from Amazon, which I did decisively.
I had to clean the pot, and I had to work for half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design.
In the shape of a cube, the designer treated the top with a slightly curved surface.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the end result was not achieved.
Because of the two parts at the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the top cover of the water box.
The curve of the top cover is not consistent with the curve of the control panel, and the concatenation results in a height difference of up to 2 mm.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the whole sense of design has been destroyed.
The product designer was a little distressed.
It seems that the beauty of the product manager has not yet the ability to create such a level of product.
(Of course, the feedback for the after-sales lady cannot be too high, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought is problematic, her disgust and honest heavy feelings make me understand that I can not ask too much for beauty.)
Good deal, Amazon fake deal is sad
The baby is born one week after the birth and is extremely warm.
The outside of the pot does not feel any heat, so it is not necessary to heat the pot to prevent it from spreading.
After a night in the air conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary campaign 320 great deals, later found that everyone has 249,289,299, there is a feeling of instant deception, but going to the supermarket is still more cost-effective than various miscellaneous cards at the same price, and can be carried with the car in the future.
Vitamix 6300
After a long wait, the United States and Asia saw a discount of 6300, and Central Asia bought the same amount of money overseas.
On September 2, the order was placed, and the expected arrival was number 21, and the result was number 12, almost 10 days ahead of schedule.
The box is small, the original Vitamix is used, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking down when it floats across the ocean!
The machine looked very new, the accessories were complete, the cup was shaking so much on the pedestal that I was afraid that the boot cup would fly out directly!
I asked a friend who had 5200, and he told me that it was as if I didn't have this one so loose.
The English version of the book, which comes with a random recipe, is quite tiresome, and there is no Chinese version on the Internet, which is a problem!
I bought a transformer quickly after receiving the goods, it is estimated that it will be three days, and then it will be good!
It is small, unbranched, and flat.
Not big at all!
For example, in the following example, the word "large" is used for a large number of people, and the word "large" is used for a large number of people, and the word "large" is used for a large number of people.
It was the first time I had ever been in a relationship with someone.
It doesn't feel good
The first is that the box is not very strong, it is deformed with a click, the second is that the flat design on the back prevents the ABS on the top of the box from scratching and does not work, the third is that the box is wrapped with a piece of cloth, the place where the rod stands out... and so on.
PS: The wheels really feel good
Yes, you can.
The bag is more elaborate and looks more durable.
Disadvantages: The two-dimensional code on the card can not be swept (what to do), the 15.6-inch notebook can not be put down (no matter how long it is a little), the backpack zipper can be locked, but it does not prepare a lock for the buyer, it is not a service first.
All right, I don't know if it's leather.
It is important to note that if you do not know what you are doing, you will not be able to do it.
A file in A4 format can hold 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard to hold a (non-deformable) box-like object.
The inside of the bag is soft, and the inside of the bag is more humane, or quite good.
But this bottom I got had a small trachoma, and I don't know if it's my bad character or not.
I'm going back and forth, I'm going back and forth.
All four stars are in the same order of magnitude.
ForRoyal Camera Strap SLR Strap
The strap was designed to be more scientific, practical, and practical, with a soft material on the chest to secure and protect the camera, unlike other fast shooters who used screws to secure the bottom of the camera, and it was easy to remove the camera.
Garbage sale
The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part, and after informing Amazon and giving me a phone call after the sale, after many communications, the part has not been received yet.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at any time, we will be happy to assist you.
Small defect, good sound
There is a lack of sound, a lack of sound, and a lack of sound, but the quality of the sound is good.
All Right, First Face
It took a long time, except for the low end, which was generally good.
The work is not as perfect as imagined.
When I bought it for the first time, there was a problem with something, and all the lights were flashing and unusable.
The exchange was ordered, and the goods were delivered to Shanghai three days later.
I didn't answer the phone.
The courier company said that they had only that contact.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
There was no request, and in the case of late delivery, somehow the delivery was delayed according to my request - such a text message came.
"What do you mean?"
The poor shopping experience led to doubts about the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think so.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and does not have a film on the surface; the label is not sticky enough for cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off.
The pen was OK, but the wrapping was so rudimentary that there was no protection for a paper box, and the box was glued with a large piece of transparent glue, which was ripped out of the box.
It cost $600 and was a disappointment.
It's not a problem.
Hope to see more improvements on the packaging!
If the quality is not good enough, it is better than 925-25.
First of all, let's praise the daily express, the airmail, super fast, the service attitude is also good!
925-25 has been used, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not good, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is that the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for quick writing, the pen hat adjusts the length of the lead lead core a little shaking, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.
So it became the Amazon Faithful.
The price was too high, and the children did not like to read.
It has been restored and is available for free to purchase.
It's a cow.
It is not recommended for return, but this service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
The book was later sold to a local bookseller.
Headphone eccentricity and noise
I don't know if it's a problem with my ears, or if it's really worse than it used to be.
Two years ago I bought a blue one at a convenience store, the sound quality is good, there is no murmur bass is also good, after more than two years of bad use I am going to buy another (ur beats), after all it feels good.
It was a good day, but it was a bad day, and I had to get up and go to bed.
At first I didn't think much about it because of the sound effects of the song, but after listening for half a day, I found out that the problem was serious, not only the bias, the bass effect was not good, the previous one sounded good, there was a little noise, is there only this phenomenon in the purple that I bought, or is the manufacturing process of the headphones really bad now?
Very poor evaluation, very disappointing.
Be sure to return tomorrow during the day.
PS face value is good
The exterior of the building is highly ornamented, and has a high level of heat.
The Sound Will Take a Time to Review!
On August 14, the German version of DN1080 was released.
1. Front panel, knobs are plastic.
2. The rear panel audio input jack, the speaker output terminals are all good and bad, any of the 1000-2000 CD amplifier integrated machine is much better than this one.
3. The top cover was rather thin, and my transformer was still recessed on the side, so I had to unpack it and use my hands to recover it, and the top cover and front panel were loosened.
4. The centre of gravity of the entire machine is tilted towards the transformer end and is awkward to move.
The song was inspired by the song "Sonic the Hedgehog," which was released in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony is going to put in China foundry much better than a pony.
The heat generated by the machine is so great that the top cover of the two-channel film can be touched by hand for about two hours, and it is not known whether the transformer is too large and generates too much heat.
It is now widely used for switching power supplies, and this silly transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony would have used a silent fan with active cooling inside the machine, and would have seen only the large aluminum heat sink on the tube after unpacking.

No, it's not.
The battery is working.
I want to see what's in it.
It is important to remember that if you are willing to pay more than you are willing to pay, you will be able to pay more than you are willing to pay; if you are willing to pay more than you are willing to pay, you will be able to pay more than you can afford.
"Sony uses a good battery."
As for the details of the electricity, the general public will be disillusioned when looking at it.
I had worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time, and besides not knowing the circuit, I was half a battery engineer and could handle it.
Hope for the Future
I was really nervous before I bought it, until I opened the package and it felt right!
When I finally touched the earpiece, it felt so pliable and of such good quality that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and turn on qq music.
I was amazed that the sound quality was 3D!
I asked in a physical store, about 30 or so, but it is not a winning brand, it is a mixed card, so it is said that the winning brand is 27, but the price is absolutely worth it!
The Worst Online Shopping Experience
After the order was placed on September 28, the system indicated that the shipment had been delivered, and it was not until October 12 that the order was received.
When the status of the Amazon order was checked, the seller did not provide the courier tracking number and could not locate the order.
An email was sent to the seller asking if the courier number could be provided, and no reply was received after two days.
After a few minutes, the phone rang again, and I was told that I had lost a piece of the courier, so I could send it back again.
Although I was very angry, I did not tell the seller much because the computer was in urgent need, just send it to me immediately.
As a result, the phone was called the next day and the shipment was delivered?
The seller said it was not ready until the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said it would send it, and it was delivered after 5: 00 p.m., and as a result, I called at 7: 00 p.m., and no one picked it up.
The next morning, I hit him again and asked if he had sent the goods.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said that he had not sent it, and told me that if I was in a hurry, I would order it from another house, and if I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
It takes a long time to find a new home.
You can only ask the seller to ship quickly.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received my computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I do not know, because it was bought for someone else, let's add a comment later.
It's been a long time since I've been able to do this, and now I'm not sure if I can do it.
Because of the size of the table, it was not used many times after the purchase.
Just travel in a fashion bag with a few times.
It was found that when connected to the power supply, it was not charged, and it was necessary to hold a few chargers around the hand and the connection of the wires in order to recharge.
Suspicion is that the interface has poor contact, and it is not known if it can be repaired now.
Amazon is strongly advised to discontinue EMS!
Five stars, one logistics star, three average.
I don't understand why Amazon sends EMS, which is widely accepted in the industry. Well, computers are valuable, too!
After the purchase order showed that the number 20 was expected to arrive, so the family waited three days at home!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days?
In the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to open the heart to receive the goods, as a result, in the evening did not receive any phone calls, SMS, a search of the logistics, should have been signed at noon, but also showed himself signed!
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really what I bought?
Is Life So Good?
It took me a while to figure out what to do.
The reason for this is simply that the courier's two numbers are reversed, so it is better not to lose them.
I strongly advise Amazon not to use EMS anymore, and if Amazon ever sent an EMS courier, I would never buy it again.
The goods are good
First of all say a sentence just bought a few days to find a price reduction, bad evaluation, this is also good, cost-effective, cpu and graphics enough to cope with the mainstream Internet and quite a part of large single machine, very good heat dissipation, but the screen is a bit missing light (IPS screen common disease), the sound quality is not very good, hard disk is not good (I recommend that you spend some money to add a solid), yesterday went to the after-sales detection of the hardware, no problem, comes with win8.1 is not too good to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller shipped quickly, the questions are answered, received the computer the next day invoice is good, but what gifts are not.
(By the way, do not buy a keyboard patch must not go to a treasure called E cool digital center of the store to buy, delivery slow quality, the product has a problem not to return, the boss is full of dirty words, special exposure)
Things are good, and the platform bureaucracy remains
Hard drives are of very good quality and cost effective, cheaper than those purchased in Hong Kong, and are highly recommended if they are not in a hurry and can tolerate logistics.
But it has to be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as it was a few years ago, when I swore never to use it, you can never check the actual logistics, the information will always arrive a few weeks later, you can never complain, that's the bureaucracy!
It has been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days after you receive the goods!
Logistics is not worry
Not only is the packaging squashed, but the electrical packaging is also open, and it is not known whether there is a transfer.
FYI
It has not been tested, and has always relied on Philips, hoping for a longer battery life than other brands.
If checked online, it may be a common problem with water intake, and there is no warranty.
Depressive!
How long will the cling film last?
Buy it now
It is worth noting that there are more than 100 different types of machines, and that there are more than 100 different types of machines.
When I was a child, I used to take pictures of people, and when I was a child, I used to take pictures of people, and when I was a child, I used to take pictures of people, and when I was a child, I used to take pictures of people.
Whether it will work or not in the short term remains to be seen, as in the case of the previous assessment, what is sent out when it is out of stock is not reliable!
Experience the feeling of being at a higher level
There are many types of cleaning modes, but very few people change the brush every day.
It takes about six months to complete, and it takes less than a month to complete.
Brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a little hard to use, but other than changing the colors, other seemingly compatible problems are the reasons for the overseas version?
I want to learn Dafa.
Very good value for money
It has been used 3-4 times.
1, the packaging is good.
2. Very simple to use and easy to clean.
You can cut your hair and save money.
Overall, it was a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
In the first two versions of the game, it is revealed that there are two different versions of the game, one of which is a white cat and the other is a green cat.
I am not sure if Amazon's source is fake or if the shipment was dropped by an employee.
I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will hold you accountable.
It's a horizontal bar!
Isn & apos; t it deceptive that Amazon & apos; s picture is slashed and the result is sent to me as a horizontal bar?
The effect is fine.
Cats love to eat, and that's the point.
It does work.
Tight, narrow, clenched feet, worn on the back.
Not recommended.
1. The United Nations is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately it is too bad.
For example, in the case of the previous series of shoes (the shoes were thrown with cushioning), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is less than before, and the ventilation is less than before, which is false soft.
2. The back of my foot is not counted as high, and the part of my foot is about 3 cm forward at the top of the back.
3. Three pairs of clarks were purchased overseas, only one suitable.
I was in the middle of a conversation.
It is not possible to go back to Rockport without going to the ECCO store.
Shoddy, poorly controlled
First of all, it is worth noting that Prime's overseas purchase of Ups was very strong, and the single 6 under 31 received it.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the skin feels good.
The shoe is slightly larger, 7.5 W with a length of 25 feet and a width of 10.5 cm, and the upper foot is slightly looser, but it is usually worn looser, just like a pair of shoes.
Secondly, the shoe quality control is really not flattering, one shoe has a broken bottom glue, another shoe has various scratches and a needle eye, the top is misaligned with the sole glue, the shoe is clearly shoddy!

My foot is very standard kind, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's love step also bought a few pairs, never appeared, but this pair I refer to the comments, I bought a big number uk7, the foot is obviously long because it is a large length, but because the insole is too thick, or pressure on the back of the foot is severe, and the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in the foot is very uncomfortable.

Nearly half a month later, the items were returned in their original packaging, including the delivery box that I had used to send them!
No response, no acknowledgment of receipt and no test report!

It is not necessary to return it immediately.
Toys of good quality, spit out the package

The next day, at 6: 00 am, I was told that I was thinking about it, and when I saw that 256G was available for delivery the same day, I had to order another one.
Once the new purchase is made, the intention is to immediately cancel Amazon's order.

If the order is not delivered, the customer will be contacted immediately and asked to cancel the order, and the customer's response will be OK.
At 3: 00 p.m., when the phone looked at the order, there was no way but to contact the customer service again to make it clear that the call had been made for the third time, please cancel the order and inform the seller that it must not be shipped!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would wait until he was familiar with the system before cancelling the order.
However, I was told clearly that the seller already knew, so please rest assured that the goods will not be shipped.
When I looked at the order again on Monday, it showed that it had been delivered, and I was speechless.
Unable to contact the seller directly, they had to call the customer service again.
The rest of the process was very simple: I said one step, and then the customer went on to do it.

CHAPTER I
He is, as his name suggests, a good man.
It is said that he lived in a small town in the north of the country, which is not well known, and if he planned to build a 20-ring and 30-ring ring, he could barely be regarded as a child of heaven, and if the good people of the whole world were reckoned on his head according to the harmony, he would be known as the world, and no one would know him walking on the road, and he lived for 20 years with a big face that looked like a common man except a little man.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, walking on the streets during the day under the sun can be very irritating, so that all kinds of cars can be seen everywhere in the center of the city, but it is not possible to see how many pedestrians are walking outside, and the tall young man wearing a white T-shirt, gray pants, and ordinary face is one of the few pedestrians.
Hao Ren felt that this year's students were becoming less and less dedicated to their work, and that he never gave them a look when he worked outside as a hairstylist, but anyway, this kind of hard folding fan is suitable.
"The last two are not yet ready." Hao Ren grumbled at the last two job advertisements in his hands, fortunately they are next to each other, and he can quickly complete the "task" of today, and one of them is in front of the advertising company, which is absolutely not visible from the outside, but the signboard at the door of the house is loud: Galaxy Media's general culture development and promotion company, the name of which is bound to fall in half a year, Hao Ren was the name of the goods at that time, the main purpose is not to apply, or to see what kind of the company owner who can come up with such a magic name.
He walked a few hundred meters around the barrier of the road, and then, under the sun, ran to the front of the advertising company called Special Ox X, and was surprised to find that the company had indeed closed, and the sign at the door still hung, but the glass door had a notice of closure, dated two days ago, and the job offer in his hand was four days ago...
In the second half of the book, the narrator, who had been working at a local advertising agency for two years, looks down at the last copy of the book and throws it in the same place two seconds later, thinking about whether he was blind when he screened it two days before - a clerk at the bus company's office, who is required to be between 25 and 40 years old, and who is able to work hard and have experience with computers.
He took hold of it and went to the city center with great interest, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising company that had been busy recruiting workers two days before its closure were.
He is the son of a wealthy man, and the son of a wealthy man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man, and the son of a poor man.
It's a sad story.
He was looking for a job in the city today, but he personally had no urgent need for a source of livelihood: As mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lived in an old house left by his parents, and should be grateful for the family business left by the older generation, at least the house is large - it is a two-story old house that has been transformed into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For many years, Hao Ren lived in a rented house, but due to the remoteness of the place where he lived, it was possible that he would have to wait for several decades for the demolition of the old house.
In this case, it is not necessary to go out to find a job, but the person who has been idle for a long time is a bit of a temper, always feeling that he should make a little effort to open up the path of life, and more importantly, the place of his old house is too far away from human civilization, and since the last migrant couple moved from the rental house, there has been no one to rent a house for half a year, watching the two floors of the apartment that have been empty for several months.
After studying the city plan for three days at home, Hao Ren believes that it is unlikely that the area around his house will become a commercial center overnight, and considering that he cannot waste himself as a great man, he finally decides to find a job first and at least have an income to support himself.
How could he have starved himself to death when he was a hard-working man who worked to earn money for school?
However, his fate is not dependent on the will of the man, and he runs out of the house on the first day...
After a short time, he decided to take a break under the shade of a tree in a small park on the side of the road, wait for the hottest hour of the day to go to a small hotel to fill his stomach, and then take a car home.
Even in the midst of rapid economic development, the little place remained relaxed and bright: he found a piece of paper to wipe the bench, then lay down, covered his face with a sheet of folded paper bearing the hospital's logo and a pretty girl, and went to sleep.
But just as he was about to lie down for a minute, the light that was pouring in through the edge of the fold dimmed, as if someone had come to him, and Hao Ren, with a slight surprise in his face, was surprised to find that the sun had already set, and that a small, thin woman was standing next to him.
"Are you awake?"
At the end of the series, the girl realizes that she has no idea what she is doing, so she grins and turns her face slightly so that she can see what she is doing.
A very beautiful girl - this is the first impression of Hao Jin.
The young girl, with her shawl and short hair, was probably very athletic, her skin was a little milky, she was healthy and full of sunshine, she was beautiful and beautiful, and most of all, she had big, moving eyes, and she was more energetic than any pair of eyes Hao Ren had ever seen, as if the entire human spirit were coming out of those eyes.
Behind her, however, is a large suitcase that looks heavy.
Looking at the stunned Hao Ren, the beautiful girl with short hair burst out with an unprecedented silly smile (although it seems to be a bit inappropriate, but Hao Ren does think it is a silly smile), which is clean and pure, and seems to be rarely seen in the face of a girl of the same age as him, who has been squealing in his bag for a long time, and finally finds a wrinkled piece of paper to hand to Hao Ren: "Do you know where this place is?"
Hao Ren slaps his face and wakes himself up, regardless of what is going on with this presumptuous girl, but instead looks down at the address on the paper...
Chapter 1
In the morning, the sun shines brightly and the sky is blue.
In the middle of the forest, a young boy, wearing a loose military dress, squats down, his tongue rests against his teeth, and his whole body is concentrated on the left and right punches, and he hits a big tree.
It is smooth, smooth, smooth, smooth, and does not have a sharp edge.
He is 14 years old, handsome, handsome, and handsome.
The eyes are dark, and the eyes, like the eyes of an old man, are dark.
Three hours later, the sun was high.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at the bloody punches, and sighed softly: "I worked twice as hard as others, and the result was less than half as good."
"Coming to another world, I don't know, is it a blessing or a curse?"
Two months later, he wakes up in a plane crash and finds himself in a world called the Land of the Moon.
He became a student of a military academy in the continent.
It took him two months to digest the memory of his former master.
The land of the dead, the land of the living, the land of the dead, and the land of the living.
It is the highest peak of the human race and the highest peak of the human race.
It is divided into nine levels, each of which has three levels: small, large, and high.
In the ninth chapter of the Book of Mormon, he is described as a "god of the dead," a "god of the living," and a "god of the dead."
The Kingdom of Heaven is the ultimate in martial arts and the ultimate in the pursuit of millions of human beings.
It is said that the god of the earth, the god of the sea, is able to move the earth, the sky, the sky, and the sky.
A human king, who can change the mood of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a divine being.
But how difficult is the world?
He was the youngest of four children in the village, and at the age of 14, he became the youngest person in the village's history to reach the top of the mountain.
However, when he was admitted to the university, he discovered that he was a frog in the bottom of the well.
The school is run annually by the University of the West of Scotland, with the exception of one year each year.
And he, of all the geniuses of the school of the warrior sect, is only the bottom!
The school is divided into three categories according to the degree of qualification.
The most notable of these is the "Golden Age," in which the most talented people in the city are educated and educated, and the most talented people in the city are educated and educated.
For example, in the case of a small town with a high population, there is a high probability that a small town will have a high population.
In fact, he is the only one who knows the truth, and he is the only one who knows the truth, but he is not the only one who knows the truth, and he is the only one who knows the truth.
It is not uncommon for students to have a very limited amount of experience in the classroom, and to have a very limited amount of time to learn.
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 아이돌아온다, '어디인가' 아이돌아온다..." 아이유, '아이돌아온다... "아이돌아온다". "
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 아이돌아온차트, 오늘 (6 일) 공개..." '내친구의집은어디인가 "."
Sue has teeth, a severe pain in her shoulder and is silent.
The school is run by a board of trustees, who are responsible for the day-to-day running of the school, as well as the day-to-day running of the school.
Half a Tea.
The school has a fine, elegant, and dreamlike atmosphere.
Only core students, senior students, and dignitaries are allowed to rest here, but gold students and silver students are not eligible.
Su Yu was also the first to come to the lavish lounge, where ordinary poor boys might be nervous, but Su Yu, the former head of the business elite, the five-star hotel, the presidential suite, the lavish ball, was a regular guest, quiet and unflattering.
There are three men, a boy and a girl, and a boy and a girl.
When she was 14 years old, her eyes were closed.
She was a beautiful woman with a pretty face, like a fairy, with a delicate carving, a fair skin like the snow of the spring, a fine figure, wearing a fine white coat, like a fox fairy, very beautiful.
She looks at him with a cold look and a bit of complacency.
At the age of sixteen, he was a handsome, handsome, handsome, and handsome man.
Qin Guogong, one of the Three Kingdoms of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, there was no arrogance, but on the contrary, he was very kind and asked Su Yu to sit down with a smile.
He shook his head coldly and did not move at all.
Many of the people who live in the village are very proud and proud of themselves and their heritage.
Like the politicians of the earth, they are very angry, but after they meet, they shake hands, smile, and stab their hands under the table.
"I am the father of Qin Feng, and I have come this time for his affairs with Ching." Qin Guogong's handsome face, emerging with a friendly smile, "I heard Feng-er say, and I, as Feng-er's father, apologize to you."
A young girl named Kang Xueqing is a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu, and is also listed as a student at the Wuzong Academy.
There are two types, the male and the female, and the female, the male and the female.
However, when he entered the school of Emperor Wuzong (武宗学院), Jiang Xueqing from the small village town was shocked by the huge prosperity of the world, and gradually became intoxicated with the world.
As a young girl, she is not afraid to be admired by the younger generation.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stay true to herself and spend the first school year with Suwa.
However, she soon realizes that she is a cruel woman, and that she has changed from a naïve little girl to one who knows that Su Yu will never have a future with her, and that she may suffer and become a human being.
In the end, her inner line of defense is broken.
Two years later, he became a member of the House of Lords, and became a member of the House of Lords.
Although the two men have never met before, they have always been close friends and have always been close friends, even though they have never met before.
He became a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Su Yu was hit, and repeatedly begged Gang Xueqing to change his mind, but Gang Xueqing refused to do so.
It is said that he was unable to bear the grief of his life, and that he threw himself into the lake, and by chance, a plane crash occurred in Suyu on the earth, and his soul passed through this sad and pitiful weakling.
"Well," he said, "if you want me to do it, I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for you, and I'll do it for you."
After hearing Qin Guogong's words, Su Yu shook his head in the dark, and this trick deceives ordinary people and is not useful to him.
Take away my girlfriend and let me do it? This is an apology.
The Duke of Qin appeared to be gentle, but in fact was full of outright insults.
If a woman of the sovereign, a woman of the emperor, is respected by his son, will he dare to let the sovereign give up his own woman to Qin Feng? He does not dare, because he does not provoke the sovereign, he can only provoke civilians like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head lightly, got up and wanted to go, he did not have any attachment to a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing, and even if the Qin ruler did not use force, he did not intend to fight for her.
As for Qin Guogong's so-called compensation, Su Yu, although lacking the resources for cultivation, although a poor boy, although he had nothing, he also had a will not to lose, and he had not yet fallen to the point of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understands "Su Yu" 's character, stubbornly refusing to lose, seeing that he wants to leave, but when he still refuses to give up, he bites silver teeth lightly, walks lightly, snow eyes like a cold moon: "Su Yu, please respect my choice!"
"Now that I'm here, I'm going to tell you the whole story, and I hope you're going to die."
"You are a little boy," he said, "and you are a little boy, and you are a little boy, and you are a little boy."
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공 '한끼성공', 한끼성공 (종합)."
"I don't know," he said, "but I know that you are the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most beautiful, the most beautiful."
"Well, then," he said, "if you want to see me again in the future, I will do my best to compensate you, and I will give you a few silver coins, and you will be able to improve your skills, and your days at school will be much better than mine."
As a result of this, Kang Xue Qing took out a statue of a woman the size of a palm from her sleeve and carved it out of crystal.
The most beautiful of all, the woman in the crystal statue, is beautiful in spirit, as beautiful as a fox, as beautiful as a fairy, as obsessive as a fairy.
The female figure of the statue is lifelike, and the master who holds it, Jiang Xueqing, is generally the same.
"This is a gift from you to me, and now, to you, we owe nothing to each other." Jiang Xueqing, mercilessly tucked the statue in the hands of Su Yu, turned back to the side of Chen Feng, looked out of the sky, no longer look at Su Yu, cruel and cruel.
"Chu Yao, I love you, why would you kill me?"
Then he went to the door, opened it, opened it, and sat down.
It was a dream come true, a dream come true, a dream come true, a dream come true, a dream come true.
No!
It's Not a Dream!
How could it be a dream?
He was the only son of Emperor Ming, one of the Nine Great Emperors of Kunlun, and at the age of 16, he was in a state of incongruity with the heavens and reached the highest level of perfection.
However, when he became the first member of the younger generation in Kunlun, he died at the hands of his fiancée Princess Chiyo.
She is the daughter of one of the Nine Kingdoms.
He and his wife are best friends, and he and his wife are best friends when they get married.
A handsome, handsome, golden girl, who could have been a good word in the world of training, and who could not have guessed that Princess Chu Yao would have acted against him!
After the death of Princess Chiyo, Zhang regained consciousness and found himself eight hundred years later.
She was the first of the nine emperors to unite the nine kingdoms and establish the First Central Empire, becoming the ruler of the entire kingdom of Kunlun.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors of Kunlun were completely lost in the long river of history.
The Queen is dead and the Queen is alive.
In this era, there was only one emperor, the Empress Dowager Chiu, who ruled the heavens and was powerful in all directions.
"Why did she kill me?
How could her heart be so hard, or say that a woman's heart is so hard? "
Eight hundred years have passed since then, and it has been long since gone, except for the immortal Empress Chiayi, who is still young and immortal.
All of those who once lived in the past have been reduced to ashes and bones, and even the nine Emperors, who were so powerful at the time, have all perished on earth, leaving behind only a glorious story that has been passed down for a long time.
"Squeeze!"
A frail palace lady, pushing in from the outside, looking at the dust on the bed, with a concerned look, "Dust, have you had nightmares again?"
She is the daughter of the king of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the daughter of the king of the Kingdom of Heaven.
His wife, who had been ill for three years, died in bed.
After the death of her husband, she was brought back to life in the same hospital where she had been born.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body, also called Zhang Ruodun, who had just woken up, still rejected Lin.
After all, in the eyes of Zhang Ruodun, Lin is just a stranger, but after three days of contact, Zhang Ruodun gradually found out that Lin really cares about him, and it was almost inattentive, and when he saw Zhang Ruodun doing nightmares, he was terrified, and he immediately rushed to the dusty room regardless of the cold.
In my last life, I never saw my mother, who is said to have died at the time of her birth!
"I don't know," she said, "but I don't know if it's true or not, and I don't know if it's true or not."
If she tells the truth, she will not be able to withstand this terrible blow.
He looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened and smiled, "My dear, don't worry about me, it's just a dream."
Princess Lin, with her thin body clad in a maroon hooded mink, sat by the bed, stroking her dusty forehead, and said, "For three days now, you have been awoken by nightmares, and each time you have called her by the name of 'Ji Yao.' Who is she?"
It is not possible for the Queen to be named after the Emperor of the Middle Ages.
After the establishment of the First Central Empire, the Empress Dowager Ciyao unified the realm of Kunlun, and she was called the "Great Empress Dowager," and no one dared to mention the word "Ciyao" at all.
Zhang Ruodun said, "Nothing, my daughter, you heard me wrong!"
She sighed, and said, "Never again, even in a dream, call out the word 'Chi Yao', which is the name of the Empress. It is profane to call out the name of the Empress, and if it is heard, it will be put to death."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
In the future, I will be her nightmare.
She looked at him with a pale face, and her eyes were full of tears.
Although he was born in the house of the county king, he was sickly as a child, and at the age of sixteen, he could only lie in bed all the year round, and I am afraid that it will be the same for the rest of his life.
Outside, there was a clatter of footsteps.
"What are you doing?
A handsome waitress, who wanted to stop the intruding prince, was pushed by the prince to a height of more than ten metres, and the prince was a warrior who, in order to reach the end of the Yellow Realm, was able to hit a stone plate weighing three hundred pounds with a single stroke, much less a waitress weighing one hundred pounds.
With a single stroke of her finger, she can fly away.
The waitress screamed and fell to the ground, breaking her left arm.
Hachioji, dressed in a golden robe with a jade belt around his waist, was in good health, with long arms, and with a steady pace, went into the Jade Sou Palace and glanced coldly at the waitress, "A slave dared to block the way of this prince, and indeed he was looking for death."
After the eight princes, they were accompanied by six guards, all of whom were tall, with a tiger's back and a bear's waist, all of whom were apparently powerful martial monks, who were guards of the palace.
When she heard the noise, she closed the door and went out.
She looked at Hachioji standing outside, frowning slightly, and said, "Hachioji, this is the palace of Gyokuso, even if you are a prince, don't mess with it."
Zhang Ji, the eighth prince, raised his head and looked at Lin, and said, "The queen has an order, and the sleeping house of Lin's daughter and her nine-year-old brother has been changed to the 'purple garden.' From now on, the owner of the Jade Sou Palace will be the real mother of this prince."
Her face had changed slightly, and she had expected the day to come, but had not expected it to come so soon.
She said, "The Queen is going to drive our mother and son out of the Jade Palace so soon.
She said that she wanted to go to the Jade Sou Palace tonight, and asked Princess Lin to move to the Parthenon now! "
Hachioji smiled coldly and said, "Princess Lin, there are many poor people in the world, but not everyone deserves pity. What do you do in the world if your nine-year-old brother is sick?"
"He's your nine-year-old brother!"
After a few moments, the door behind her is opened.
He has a weak body and can barely stand with his hands on the doorpost, staring at the eight princes who are not far away.
He seemed to have a weak body, as if he had an unyielding will, saying, "Don't ask them, we'll move now."
"Dust, how did you get out of bed? It was cold outside, and I didn't want to go back."
She looked up at him, her eyes wide with tears, as if she were looking at him.
The Queen and the Prince go out of the palace one step at a time, except for a maid who is pushed out of the palace by the Prince to break her arm.
All the other servants did not follow them out of the palace, and all could see that Lin and the Nine Princes had completely lost their power, and it was difficult for them to find a place in the county palace.
They were the servants of Gyokusou Palace, and now they are naturally wise to stay in Gyokusou Palace, and all go to the new owner of the eight princes.
It is the only place in the world where the Queen of Hearts has lived, and it is believed to have been abandoned for a long time.
The night is cold and cold.
Sitting on a cold stone bench, his thin, thin body clad in a coat, he still feels cold.
"This body is too weak, and only by practicing martial arts can the body become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am now the son of the king of the county, I can only be at the mercy of men. "
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang has no idea where he is going.
Since God has arranged for him to be reborn in this body, he must become strong, whether for the sake of revenge against the future Empress Chiyo or for the sake of the one who takes care of himself, and the humiliation and cold treatment he has endured today are all because he is too weak to resist, unable to control his own destiny, and even the place where he lives has been taken by others.
If you want to be respected by others and have a warm and comfortable living environment, you have to be a warrior and prove your ability.
In order to become a warrior, one must first open the "Seal of God."
The term "God of War" refers to the power of the Holy Spirit in the creation of mankind.
Those who do not open the "seal of divine power" will never be able to cultivate the true spirit and become the strong one between heaven and earth.
At the age of sixteen, he missed the best age for martial arts, and even though he opened the "God Marks," he could not achieve much.
He is also the son of the king of Yunwu County, so why should the eight princes be superior? Can Zhang Ruodun and Lin be expelled from the palace?
When he was eight years old, he opened the "God of War Mark" and is now a young warrior in the Yellow Realm.
"When I was a child, I was able to do the nine-day miniseries.
Even if I have missed the best cultivation age, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial artist again. "The Nine Days of the Ming Dynasty is the supreme treasure of the Ming Dynasty cultivation, except for the Ming Dynasty, only Zhang Ruodun knows the complete cultivation method of the Nine Days of the Ming Dynasty.
"Tomorrow is the day of the Sacrifice, and I hope to receive the approval of the gods, and to open the seal of God."
He has a strong desire to open the "seal of God."
When she came to the door, she said to him, "Go in the morning, and I will give you rest."
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 강호동한끼성공 (종합)."
"Hmmm!
She looked at me and smiled.
CHAPTER I
"Don't worry," he said, "I'll be back in a few minutes, and I'll be back in a minute."
After a dozen breaths, a young man with a floppy head was dragged out of the iron gate by two jailers with his arms in his hand; the young man with a floppy head, who seemed to have no breath, and even a thin arm, was left with only his bones.
The thin man was thrown on the ground by two jailers, splashed with some dust, and remained motionless.
"What is the matter?" asked the young man, who was still staring at him.
The other jailer muttered, "He is supposed to be dead, and who let him know that he is alive, who dares to be rude to Miss Jane. Now it would be better for him not only to be annihilated, but also to be liberated."
"Be careful, old man, and we'll take him out first," exclaimed the stout jailer.
When he heard this, the other jailer, unwillingly, shrunk his head and pulled the man from the ground, ready to be dragged away.
At this point, a softer voice shouted, "Two big brothers, I want to take my husband away."
The two talking jailers then saw a woman in heavy linen standing next to them, who, despite her heavy clothing, was still able to discern her vulgar appearance; the only regret was that her face had been disfigured and covered with a slightly disheveled hair so that she would no longer be able to see the second eye.
The two jailers recognize the woman, one of the only surviving members of the family.
Ning Gao was the housekeeper of Ning Prefecture, and when Ning Prefecture was raided, he escaped by leaving Qin Qin for business, and this woman, Ning Prefecture's daughter-in-law, was also the wife of the lean man who had just been thrown out of prison.
She was saved because she stayed at Chong Qin Two-Star College, and, of course, because she had little connection with the Ning family, she got married to the Ning family because the Ning family and the Ning family had a close relationship, and she and the Ning family became close friends, but the Ning family died in the most inexplicable way, leaving only a disfigured Ning family.
Even so, Ningcheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still keeps Princess Jiluo in the house, and is ready to marry the two when Ningcheng really gathers.
"All right, all right, drag it away and leave it here to die," said the stout jailer, waving his hand impatiently.
They were supposed to dispose of the corpse in Yongcheng, but they did not expect anyone to come and dispose of it, and they returned the silver coins, a good thing they certainly would not refuse.
When she heard this, she quickly turned her back on the city and quickly disappeared from the prison gates.
"If she had not been disfigured, she would have been a beauty," said the other jailer, looking at her back, in a tone of judgment, tossing the silver coin in his hand.
"Don't talk nonsense, Princess Nagilo, who is also a member of the Qin Two Star Academy, is ugly, and will not round us." The stout jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder and pulled him into the iron door again.
When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a white patch of neck, and the next moment he remembered that he had been carried by a woman, and that the scent had come from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembers being rejected by Tammuwan, he was in a bad mood, he ended up going the wrong way, a man went up on an elevated platform, and then a yellow beam from the sky hit him, and then he was gone.
Is it true that he is not dead, and what is the matter?
It was the first time in his life that he had ever seen such a thing, and he had been born again.
To the horror of the small town of Ning, the body he was born into was originally called Ning, because his original name was also Ning.
Just because he had a nightmare, he saw himself in a strange place, locked up in a cell, and tortured to death, and although it was just a dream, Ning changed his name to Ning.
Not wanting to turn around, he calls the city of Ning, and is actually reborn in the environment of his dream.
The woman who was carrying him looked back at him and did not say much.
"I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk," said the woman, looking back at herself.
"Ning is gone, you are lucky to be alive." The woman's tone was serene, as if she were actually dead.
He had just finished sorting out some of the pieces of information, and now he should have called back to Ningcheng again, which was the only one of Qin's family.
Ningcheng's parents went to the sea of Mango to look for spirits when they were young, and never returned. Ningcheng has been living in Changle, the capital of the Qin state, with his grandfather Ninghongchang.
Of course, Ningcheng also became the first person in Ningfu, and Ninghongchang never paid any attention to Ningcheng. Ninghongchang was responsible for all the bad things that Ningcheng did in Cangle. Cangle was full of Wang's relatives, and although Ninghongchang was also the elder of Qin, he was a little worse than those of Wang's relatives.
Finally, one day, the city of Ningcheng caught up with him, and he offended Jian Sujie, the patron of the Jian family in Qin, not to mention that Jian Sujie, Jian Sujie's fiancé, and Jian Sujie's fiancé, Jian Sujie.
In the end, he was not protected, but the whole of the Ning family was put in, and the news that his predecessor had heard from the jailer was that the Ning family had been exterminated, and that the Ning family had been exterminated.
In the end, it is revealed that there is no one in the world who knows what is right and who is wrong.
At the same time, he realizes who the man is who is carrying him on his back, and that the disfigured woman is his fiancée, Princess Gilroy, some of whom resemble child brides on Earth.
Later, the Ji family fell into inexplicable decline, leaving only a disfigured Princess Gilo, but Ningcheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Princess Gilo to Ningcheng and was ready to help the two marry after Ningcheng regained its energy.
It is said that he was not satisfied with the disfigured Princess Gilo of Ningcheng, and that he was always swearing at her, and that he never objected to her; moreover, unlike Princess Gilo of Ningcheng, she was qualified and capable of cultivation.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Chong Qin Two-Star Academy, and was already a monk of three layers, and in the Chong Qin kingdom, anyone who could cultivate was called a monk.
By this time, the Countess Giraud had carried him back into a very low, black-stone house, which, though low, was not small in size, but at least had it, and there was even a small courtyard with a deep well in it.
Even if it is his own fault, Ninh must clarify the matter, and although he suspects that Jane and Khujia did it, he must ask some questions.
"What do you want me to do for you?" she asked.
Then she poured another glass of water and fed the city, and said, "I'm going to boil water for you to bathe, and forget some things, you know they're not good for you."
The more he knows, the faster he will die, and the more he will die.
It is not known if Princess Giro had added anything to the glass, but the city felt that after drinking the glass, the entire population regained some strength.
When he came to the city, he saw his sister Nimruwan, who was sitting on an old wooden couch, and he thought of his present situation, and then of his sister Nimruwan; but he did not understand why Tian Mu Wan was like him, and according to his knowledge of Tian Mu Wan, Tian Mu Wan was not a snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
The river flows through the lake and flows through the lake.
It is one of the largest and most beautiful islands in the world, with a total of 89 islands, and it is located at a distance of 18 km from the East Gardens.
On the boat, he was of medium stature, with a sweatshirt that floated in the air, and looked at the vast lake, and his thoughts flowed far away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days!
He is a physicist with a bright future, a great scientist of the future, a small mistake in the experiment, an explosion later on in the world, and a reincarnation!
"Bang!" broke his musing and turned his head to see a golden carp jumping on the boat.
Shaking his head, he stooped and threw the carp back into the lake, and when he got up, a tall building appeared before his eyes.
It is 100 meters high, with a bronze light, thick and strong, and has the prestige of a public house.
This Bronze Tower Is the Palace of the Warriors!
There are a number of activities in the area, such as running a horse race, running a horse race, running a horse race, running a horse race, or running a horse race.
When the ship came ashore, she did not take a few steps, and suddenly a handsome young man with a crown of jade, eyebrows like a sword, appeared.
He was tall, a tall man, and looked down at him: "What are you doing here, Chu?"
Fearful: "Let's go, good dog!"
The handsome young man smiled and said, "You don't want to practice martial arts?"
He smiled and went on, "I'm going to scream, believe it or not, you can't eat it."
It is forbidden to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, and to kill.
He is the only member of the group who is not a member of the group; he is the only member of the group who is not a member of the group, and he is the only member of the group who is not a member of the group.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공 (종합)."
He took a step forward, with a gloomy face: "Chu, you can only use these small means!"
He laughed and said, "If you're a fool like yourself, a little is enough!"
When he is about to die, he stares at him, clenches his fists more and more tightly, as if waving them out at the next moment, but he is too lazy to look at him, and he is full of provocative taste.
Cho Fei Yang suddenly smiled and raised his hand forcefully: "Zhao Shimei!"
In the distance, a beautiful young girl with curly hair, snowy skin, apricot eyes, fine temperament, and gentle like water.
Chu's face changes slightly, and Zhao Ying enters the house with them at the same time, being beautiful, kind, gentle, and the kind of woman that a man would like to see.
"What is it?" he asked, "what is it?"
She smiled at him and said, "I have not seen you for a long time."
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he spent most of his time in the library, trying to change his fate with knowledge, and rarely came to the martial arts hall.
In this case, it is important to have a good understanding of the process, and to have a good understanding of how the process works and how the process works.
"Congratulations, brother Chu," said Zhao, "the East Garden is a beautiful place."
"It's okay," he said.
He is the only member of the group to appear in the third season, and not only is he the only member of the group to appear in the third season, but he is also the only member of the group to appear in the third season, and the only member of the group to appear in the third season.
He took a deep breath, and this guy was lucky enough to go into the east garden, and the sky was too dark to open his eyes, so he did not take care of him.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
He frowns and finds it hard to speak.
"Well, don't say that he's a waste!" he laughs, glancing away, "even though he's a waste!"
He glared at her.
"It doesn't matter," said Chu, smiling. "There's no need to think about this arrogant idiot."
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공."
"Well," he said, "come to me, and I will give you my word, and I will give you my word."
"What do you think of it?" he asked, with a smile. "Well, what do you think of it?" he asked.
He becomes angry, angry, and decides not to talk to her.
He said, "If you want to do it, I'll do it for you, and if you don't, I'll do it for you."
Chu Ji looked at her deeply and said, "Zhao Shimei, some people have a good skin, and they can only see the hearts of people for a long time, and they don't trust others easily!"
"What do you mean?."
He smiles at her, and she smiles at him.
She turned and left.
When he was about to leave, he noticed that he was not paying attention, and suddenly reached out his hand.
He is very confident that he will not be able to avoid it, and seems to be unaware of it, but he is able to do so quickly.
The head is flattened, the cheeks are flattened, the cheeks are flattened, and the cheeks are flattened.
"Pam!"
There was a knock on the door.
His left hand is clapped on his face, clear, weak, loud, and then his hand is quickly withdrawn.
Zhao Yingyu turned his head, as if the palm had not been hit on his face.
He stared at him with a dull expression. He smiled, and touched his face: "What a work, admiration!"
She stared at him.
"'비정상회담' 정상회담, 이상수상수상."
"I can't help it, I really don't mean it." "I don't care," he said coldly, biting his teeth, squeezing his voice out of his teeth.
"Come on," he said.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공' (종합)."
In the middle of the film, she is seen staring at the back of Zhao Yingwei, touching her hot left face, and starting a large round mirror to suppress her mind.
If it were not for great wisdom, there would be no escape.
The world is full of evil and evil, and the world is full of evil, evil, and evil.
But as a man, he needs a woman to protect him, and as a man, he can't bear it!
He passed through the crowd on the practice field and entered the martial arts hall.
The young man, who was standing in front of the house, looked at the clock and asked if he could see it.
In the book, he is shown walking, stopping, pulling out a book, quickly flipping it over, letting it go, stopping again, and flipping it over again.
In one hour, he had translated twenty-two books.
It was the first time in his life that he had been able to read a book, and it was the first time in his life that he was able to read a book.
Every book in the series has a title, and every book in the series has a title, a title, and a title.
He walked to the second floor, went directly to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the broken sword sheet on the second floor, turned it over again, and then pulled out the seven secret books, which are the cultivation experience of the broken sword sheet.
When he left the Enbu-den, his mind had been imprinted with thirty secret books, twenty-two small washing notes, one broken sword sheet, and seven broken swords.
He had been sailing on a small boat, and the wind was blowing, and his anger had dissipated.
In my mind, I was the only one who knew.
In the middle of the afternoon, the sun was burning, and he drove the ship back to the East Garden.
The eastern garden is a small island of two square miles, divided into a flower garden, each with a rare flower, and the entire island floats with the scent of flowers.
There is only a small courtyard on the island, which is separated from the main entrance by a door, and a large tree covers the half of the courtyard and drives off the heat.
He went into the west chamber, brought out a blue sword, waved it in the center of the house, slowly like a taiji sword, a sweat appeared in a moment, the forehead was bright.
He has a strong sense of humor, and is able to see through the dark side of the book, but he is also able to see through the dark side of the book.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공 (종합)."
He staggered like a black bear, stretched out his arms, yawned, and lazily said, "Brother, are you back so early?"
Li Yue (李越), a ninepine bodyguard, was in charge of the east garden together with Li Yue (李越), a ninepine guard, and they were in charge of the east garden, had a good appetite, had excellent cooking skills, and had good military exploits, but they were afraid of dying and did not break into the ninepine building.
The National Guard and the National Guard each received nine salaries and ten times the salary.
For example, in the case of a 9, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, and 50, respectively.
He is often seen to have a lot of work to do, and he is often seen to have a lot of work to do, not just as a security guard, but also as a guard.
Lee shook his neck, stretched out his legs, crackled a string of bones, and then swung his punches, like a shooting star, to exhale.
"Brother, don't practice your sword, practice your fist with me!"
It has two spines, one of which is whitish and the other whitish.
The school is well known throughout the world for its fine arts and fine arts.
Between the ages of eight and eighteen, the most common form of mental illness in the United States is heart failure, which can take several years to resolve.
When he was 18 years old, he had grown up at Akihabara Temple, where he had suffered from a lack of wisdom, and had missed the opportunity to build a foundation; his spirit was twice that of an ordinary person, and his mind was strong.
In addition, he was a high-energy physicist in his previous life, and his knowledge of the world was far more than comparable.
In the end, both of them are able to see the light of day, and they are able to see the light of day.
He has a strong sense of humour, and is able to keep up with the pace of his life, and he is able to keep up with the pace of his work for the next five years.
"What are you doing here?" he asked. "What are you doing?"
"'내친구의집은어디인가'" (in Korean).
He was panting, covered in soft skin, with his sword resting on the ground, and his broken sword was too strenuous.
1. Chapter 1
In the middle of the night, the old man wakes up.
This is the instinctive response of a good soldier!
As soon as the hand fell, the pain of electric shock came, and there was no power.
He opened his eyes.
There was a knock at the door.
He has a beautiful face and looks at her with a smile.
She is a beautiful, beautiful woman who can be described as a woman of great beauty.
The Chinese, the Chinese.
He served in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police during the Great Depression, where he served in a variety of capacities.
He took part in the world class special forces competition, won the personal honor of first place in individual combat ability, and was recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, in a transnational SSS-level mission, he was killed by a fellow soldier due to a minor personal error.
As a result, he was forced to retire from football.
After retiring from military service, he remained silent for some time and chose to leave the country, becoming the champion of one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
If he is successful, he will win 100% of the time.
For many years, he remained loyal to the Chinese government.
As a result, he will not only be able to defeat the enemy, but will also be able to defeat the enemy and defeat the enemy.
Over time, he became a staple in the eyes and flesh of countries other than China.
In the eyes of others, he is a time bomb.
However, as each of the killers evaporated, the sky became more and more alive, and there was no longer a killer who dared to take on this "death mission."
Killing is tantamount to finding your own way to death, a phrase widely recognized by the world & apos; s mercenary and killer communities.
Throughout the earth, rarely meet the enemy, never defeated!
Shortly after, he received a letter from one of his most trusted agents.
In the series finale, he is shown to be an unarmed and unarmed man who plans to take part in a terrorist plot against the United States.
This, of course, is not to be ignored.
He shot!
With the help of an agent, the location of the chemical and biological weapons was found.
Just as he is about to destroy the chemical and biological weapons, he finds himself trapped in an enclosed cage in a hollow underground laboratory.
When I saw a group of R's holding a variety of guns, they appeared outside the cage, and I understood.
I was betrayed by the one who trusted me the most!
Otherwise, due to his shrewdness, the plot of the R people would not succeed.
After being shot in the head by a sniper, he is unable to escape.
"Oh, don't worry about it."
A soft voice came, full of anxiety.
He is very sure that he does not know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at her as if she were a relative, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
It was the first time I had seen her.
They are very strong, as if they had been struck by lightning.
The only thing that makes him happy is that he is also known as "The One."
He is 15 years old.
The village is named after the son of a farmer.
His mother, "Li Ju," was a nine-year-old from Li's family.
In his memory, he had no father.
In the process of merging these strange memories, it is revealed that Tian Tian Tian Tian Tian was seriously injured in bed.
In the early morning of the seventh day of the seventh month, the eldest son of the Li family, 'Li Xin', was a wild species that was not taught by his father.
However, he was not able to finish the quench, and how could he have been the opponent of the double quench of Li Xin, who was seriously injured and died.
After all the strange memories are fused together, the sky is filled with wonder.
From that moment on, he knew that he would become a part of this strange world.
From then on, he was the only one in the world, and the only one in the world.
"Yes," said the man.
There was a knock at the door, and he looked up.
A girl rushes in from the outside of the house, handing a delicate box to Li Ru.
The box was opened, and all at once the fragrance of the medicine drifted away.
"Oh, come on," she said.
Li Ju took out a black dandelion from the inside and handed it to Duan Tian.
Taking a deep breath, he opens his mouth to swallow Dan's medicine.
The water is then heated to a high temperature, and it enters his body.
Then I saw it again.
A cold wind blows through his body, causing him to heat up and heal himself.
An hour later, Li Ru withdrew his hand.
He finds that most of the pain in his body is gone, and that he is not burdened.
Was he taking the elixir?
At the same time, Ling Tian discovered that Li Rou was pale and sweaty, apparently spending a lot of energy to heal his wounds.
"Are you all right?"
It was warm in the air.
The word "mother" does not mean "mother" or "father."
"It's all right," he said.
He shook his head.
For the sake of his son, it is not worth spending this money.
"He and the seven elders are still waiting at the court." Half an hour later, the girl again entered the room and whispered.
"Let it go," said the man, "and I will take care of it myself."
His face is cold and cold, and his face is cold.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you," he said.
He was lying on the bed, his body slightly bent.
"That's a good thing," he said.
There were only two of these, and only one of them is still in use today, at the time of his death.
It is clear that his daughter's status in the Li family was not low.
"Oh my God, the master is still waiting, we are past."
Li Jue took the upper section of the sky and came to a large yard of Li's house.
This is the place where the Lee family enforced the family law, the Court!
At noon, the sun was shining brightly.
The house is filled with people, all of whom are children of the same family.
In the middle of the room, a young man is tied to a pole, and two middle-aged men are standing next to him.
In the middle of the second story, the mother and son are shown to be in a state of agitation.
"Yes, I saw it when Duan Lingtian was carried back, half-dead."
"It's not that I don't like it," he said, "but I don't like it, and I don't like it, and I don't like it."
One of the children of Lee's family saw the soft section of Lee coming up and whispered.
Li Ju wore a pair of skulls and held a bow to the middle-aged man on the left.
"And now, my son, Li Xin, who was the first to make a mistake, and now that you have nothing to do with me, my son has been exposed for a morning, can you let him go?"
At this time, the middle aged man with the eyes of a chicken, "Li Kun," the elder of the Li family, had a gloomy face.
Li Jing did not take care of him at all.
Instead, they were tied up in front of Li Xin.
"God, how did he hurt you in the morning, and now, you give him all 1510!"
When Ku Jiu wakes up, she finds that she has a life-threatening problem; the environment around her has changed, and she doesn't know it at all!
In the middle of the night, when the sun shines on the sky, the moon is shining, and the stars are shining in the sky.
Her body was covered with a thin sheet of silk, which bound her tightly from head to foot, revealing only her eyes.
She looked up at him with her eyes wide open.
He is a strong, muscular, muscular warrior, and although he is carrying a person, he is silent and looks like a practitioner of martial arts.
Gu Shu Jiu's Fingers in the Quilt Are Tightened!
She is the king of modern killers, cold and cruel, but does not expect to encounter the secret of the most trusted person, who is called Longxi, her former instructor and doctor, she does not believe in anyone, but only believes in him and even wants to marry him.
She was already dead, and did not want to go to Yan Wang to have tea, but somehow she came here.
At this point, it was time to get back to work.
She passed through!
The body is then transported to a more luxurious house, where it is wrapped like a dumpling.
"Ah... ah... save life... save life... ah, ah, do not..." The torment of the woman's tender pain came out in a moment, and she recalled the thoughts of Gu Jiu's flight.
He was a handsome man of twenty-eight years of age, with long hair tied with a blue bead, scattered on his shoulders, with smooth muscles, with strong movements, his lips were slightly slender, with a cold smile, and was a handsome man.
Below is a young girl, looking very young, with a handsome face, unlike the face of the man, with a pale face, a small mouth, a voice that is mute, sobbing, and a cold sweat that has soaked her hair to the point of pain.
Who is he?
The two men came in carrying Gu Jiu, but they were not able to disturb the man's good mood, and he moved faster and harder!
At last the girl could not restrain herself, and cried a few times in a hoarse voice, and her eyes turned round, and her head became crooked and motionless.
The man cursed, turned around, stepped down from the girl, and kicked the girl out of the bed like garbage.
The girl was motionless, her face had turned waxy yellow, blood was flowing from her lips, and she did not know whether she was dead or alive.
"This is too much for me," he said, "to carry the mass grave to feed the dog!"
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff City or Flagstaff City, is a small city in the western United States, located in the northern part of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, near Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
In the United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas, these four names are known to many Chinese, but it is estimated that few people know the flag city wrapped in the middle of these four areas.
Six months earlier, Li Du was one of those "few" until he came to Flagstaff to study.
Flagstaff is not well known in the United States, but there are several good universities, such as the University of Arizona and the American College of Flagstaff.
Liddell went to a school called Flagstaff National College, and the American Institute of Flagstaff had only one word, but there was a huge difference between the words!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of the American College, a private university that offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and preparatory education.
It was a wild chicken university, and Li Du was totally caught up in graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were paid only in the first half of the year, the school was shut down, and the board of trustees and admissions department got word of it ahead of time, leaving a group of international students ostracized and expelled from the school by the police.
LI Du was lucky, because the school accommodation was too messy, he did not live in the dormitory to study quietly, instead he found an apartment room to rent, and now he has a place to live.
However, his situation is much worse than that of his classmates, and his rent is now due at the end of January, and if he does not pay the rent in time, he may have to live on the streets.
Sadly, that leaves him with no money!
Of course, he could borrow money from his parents and his classmates in the country, but on the premise that he was studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he will surely not be able to study as a graduate student.
Sitting grimly at the door of the small building, the pinewood door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blond girl peeked out, "Hey, Lee, are you here?"
The girl is his landlord, Hanna-Fox, whose house is the legacy of her parents who died in a car accident, and belongs to her and her brother, Hans-Fox.
However, Hans, who claims to have a "big business to do," does not stay for a few days throughout the year, and the empty bedroom is rented out by Hannah to generate income.
When Li Du heard the call, he said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's the matter?"
The girl shrugged her shoulders and smiled, and a pear-vortex appeared on her beautiful face: "I was cleaning the fridge when I saw a few cans of beer, which must have been left by Hans. I remember that you like wort beer, so why don't you drink it?"
She holds in her hand half a dozen or so bottles of beer in a very common wooden box with a distinctive Bellevue logo.
When he sees the beer, he smiles, and there is only a small refrigerator in the apartment, which he opens and closes every day.
Also, in Hans' temperament, if there was any beer, he would not have stayed, and the guy was a drunkard.
He speculates that Hannah bought the beer to comfort him, and after learning that their school has been shut down, Hannah has repeatedly comforted him and moved him.
Hannah consoled him by offering him either a motivational book or a beer.
The American girl had asked him to learn about Chinese culture, and had learned the phrase, "get drunk and get rid of your worries." She had given him beer several times, thinking that, according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping would relieve his worries.
In American society, there are gifts that cannot be refused or misunderstood, and he cherishes his friendship with Hannah.
When he took the box, Hannah smiled and left, saying, "There are many problems in life, but it's just as good."
After repeating this American slang a few times, Lee opens the package to get a can of beer, but just as he opens the wooden box, an amber-like crystal pops out and hits the ground.
The crystal was about the size of his thumb-belly and fell heavily on the concrete, with several cracks.
It is speculated that it is amber, because it is pale yellow in color and covered with a small bug, similar to the amber he saw in his sixth grade, when they had a textbook called "Amber," and the language teacher brought them a piece of amber when they were in class.
The crystal reminds him of some of his childhood memories, and he remembers that his teacher told him that amber with bugs was precious, but unfortunately it had been torn apart, which made him regret that he would not be able to sell it for two months.
The crystal fell so badly that it broke when he picked it up, and the purple bugs that had been wrapped around it came out.
The small worm resembles a locust, and is about 2 cm long, oddly shaped, with a locust-like compound eye, but has only two legs under the belly, strange markings on the legs, and no wings on the back, making it look clumsy.
He had never seen such a creature before, and was strangely raised to see it.
Just then, something strange happens: the worm's claws suddenly move, and then he quickly regains his energy, twisting his body away from between his fingers.
He had not yet reacted, and the worm jumped up behind his palm, and the head went down, and so slowly, little by little, it got into his hand!
Lee Doo-soo, you really need to urinate!
With a scream, he stumbles into the house, shouting, "Hannah, strike 911!
Presumably his scream was too loud, and Hannah panicked when she came out: "What? What worm?"
Li Tu showed her his hand and said, "That's it, this worm in my hand!"
Hannah's face was puzzled: "The worm in your hand? What worm is in your hand?"
Not only is there a bug, but the bug is still moving, and it seems that it is not lonely after entering the palm of the hand, and it will drill out again, and half of the body will come out.
Pointing to the worm that was digging out, Riddle said, "This, this, purple locust, can't you see it?"
Li Du interrupted, saying, "I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah!"
"Shetty, the bug is coming out again!"
As he screamed, the worm slowly slipped out of his skin and jumped to the ground, protruding his upper body and supporting himself with his legs, and walking with his legs on the ground like a man.
At the same time, there is a water drain next to it, and the insects do not pay attention to it, and it is planted.
"Well," he said, "I'm not going to let you go."
Subconsciously, a thought came to his mind: What is in the drain? Will there be sewage and drown the worm?
But something incredible happened to him!
CHAPTER I
The Land of God, North Africa.
The snow covered the whole land, and the mountains were covered with silverware, and the snow fell in a rustle and rustle, and the distance between the earth and the sky was unaffected.
On the bend of the mountain road, a caravan was resting, the wind was too heavy, the carriage was difficult to move, and had to wait for the wind and snow to fall.
"Look, the coffin man!"
The shock of a middle-aged man caught the attention of the caravan, and a group of people looked up curiously at the distance, only a few eyes, and all were shaken.
As the sun rises, the heavens and the earth are darkened, and a mysterious golden coffin looms in the distance.
The golden coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the walls of the coffin were engraved with a quaint pattern and runes, which gave off a faint glow, isolating all the falling snowflakes, to the extreme.
There is also a statue of the deceased in front of the coffin.
It was a young man, apparently only fourteen or fifteen years old, with his upper body naked, his back bowed, his hands clutching two chains of chestnuts, and his shoulders bearing them, as he strove to pull the coffin forward, step by step.
Snow and Ice, the Coffin of Youth!
The image is visually striking and moving, and the light from the golden coffin behind it obscures the young man's body, making it difficult to see his face, as if the crowd had seen a divine coffin.
"This is a good thing," he said.
In the middle of the night, many of the young men go back to their homes to see if they have seen the light of day or not.
A normal wicker coffin weighs three hundred pounds, and the body of the coffin is cast in gold, not to mention at least three thousand pounds.
A young man is not a true warrior, even a strong man has only five or six hundred pounds of power, and a young man who can pull three thousand pounds of coffin alone, though it may seem strenuous, is appalling enough.
"He's a good boy, and he's a good boy, and he's a good boy."
One old man was moved, and many people nodded in agreement; the coffin pulling, though uncommon, was a rare occurrence in the history of the country, and everyone knew something about it.
After the death of an important family member in the Great North, they prefer to be buried in golden coffins, which are not buried under the earth but on the top of an iceberg, supposedly to protect their people.
In the event of a family decline or major change, the family holds a coffin ceremony, looking for a new iceberg to move the family coffin, replace the feng shui, and rebuild the family's well-being.
This is the first time I've seen it.
It is a common practice in many parts of the world, especially in North America, to have the body of the deceased buried in a coffin, and to have the body of the deceased buried in the coffin, and to have the body of the deceased buried in the coffin.
As a result, it is not uncommon for young people to be forced to work in the streets of the city, and even if they do, they will not be allowed to work in the streets of the city.
Peugeot was about 1.75 metres tall, with a wide, narrow shoulder, slender legs and a knotted musculature, and wore a quaint animal tooth around his neck, which looked wild and good in appearance.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome, with a terrifying power, and a young man who is not in a bad condition, but who has come to do this most despicable and shameful kind of coffin?
"He is not afraid of losing his temper, is he?" said the middle-aged man, looking at the golden coffin. "Is it like the coffin of the willow family? Yes, I heard that the willow family has recently suffered a great change, and has offered a price."
"Silence, the people of the willows are coming," said an old man suddenly, all the caravan hastily shut up, and looked into the distance.
Ooooh!
In the distance, there was a howl of wild beasts, a band of warriors wearing black armor and riding silver-colored wolves, and the fierce breath of the wolves did not come near them.
"Yes, it is," he said.
The entire city was surrounded by a thousand miles of forest, with only one army riding a silver wolf, which was the strongest of the willow guard.
The Silver Wolf Guards stopped when they caught up with the boy, and a middle-aged giant in the foreground, with a long whip in his hand, looked at the boy and said, "Go away, go fast!
The young man looked up, and was surrounded by a large silver wolf of a dozen meters high and two meters long. He did not have much fear, nodded, and said, "Your excellency, I will arrive before dark."
The giant drinks and runs away with the Silver Wolf Guard, soon disappearing into the distant mountains.
Land glanced at the caravan that had stopped near him, and continued silently to pull the coffin forward. He clasped the chain in his hands, carried it on his shoulders, and strode forward, each step with great difficulty, his muscles trembling, and, in spite of all this, he passed the caravan without stopping, and walked far away.
"It's so heavy!"
After a few miles, he came to a halt on a steep incline; he was so tired and sweaty in such cold weather that he could imagine his physical exertion.
After placing the coffin, he sat on a stone and took out water and dried meat from the sack behind him, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
You should be able to do that.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes quickly brightened, and he said to himself, "A coffin can be replaced with a dandelion, but I don't know if Liu's quenched dandelion is really as legendary as one can add five hundred pounds of strength?"
"If I could really add five hundred pounds of strength, I now have three thousand pounds of strength, and if I could reach ten thousand pounds of strength by pulling a dozen coffins, I would be able to awaken my blood!"
"Who dares to bully my sister in the tribe? Hey, I will soon be able to live well with my sister."
In the end, he gets up and walks out of the room, his face flushed, and his hands clasped in his lap.
Sasha, Sasha!
After a few minutes, there was a knock at the door, and then a knock at the door.
At the back is also an old man, who, with a chain in his hand, has white light on the road and a faint white light on his feet.
It was the first time in my life that I had ever seen such a man, and it was the first time in my life that I had seen such a man, and it was the first time in my life that I had ever seen such a man.
When the old man got up and looked at him, he frowned and said, "Young man, how can you pull the coffin?
The old man looked at him with a smile, and said nothing more than a quick pull away.
"If you can't wake up any more, what's your future? You can only live a life of idleness, being bullied every day, with your sister following you."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
In the end, it is revealed that he has a broken leg, and that he is trying to get out of the car, but he is too scared to move.
The wind and snow were getting louder and the sky was getting darker, and the golden coffin in the middle of the road was shining with a mysterious glow.
My Goddess Chapter 001 Ah!
"My brother is looking for a job, and you do your homework well at home, and here's ten bucks, and don't forget to go out at midday to buy something to eat."
In front of a small hut in the slum, the ground patted Lori's head and rubbed it lovingly and rubbed it, and it is good to see my sister alive and healthy!
"I don't know," she said, "I don't know."
Her sister, Lu Xin, who was very considerate, helped her to organize her clothes, and, like a little adult, exhorted her, "You must work hard, my brother will endure hardship, and I am sure he will find a job this time."
"I am sure that you will find a good job, make a lot of money, and make a good life for yourself," said Lu, clinging to his sister, adding that he will not lose his life because of the lack of money.
"When I was a kid, I had a lot of money," he said, "and I had a lot of money."
No matter how hard they try, they have to say goodbye to each other.
When he gets on the bus, he puts his hand in his pocket and smiles bitterly.
The money that had been given to her by her sister for lunch was returned to her pocket, and she should have expected that the little girl would have done so.
It is now the 23rd century, and technology has developed infinitely, and intelligent technology has permeated every corner of the world. This development has brought tremendous progress to people & apos; s lives, but it has also, incidentally, minimized the need for manpower.
Unemployment is nothing new, especially for those at the bottom of the social ladder, where finding a stable job is a luxury.
If there were no accidents, he would remain unemployed.
It was not until the end of the game that he was finally able to make it to the top of the ladder, but by the time he reached the top of the ladder, he had already been in the game for almost a year.
Two years later, his sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a medical examination at school.
There is no money to pay millions of dollars for treatment, and the game continues to be chased down by several labor unions throughout the game, only to watch his only loved one grow weaker day by day.
It is more difficult than cutting the meat with a knife, and the land is holding the sister crying more than once.
On the day of his death, Lu, after crying for a while, fell asleep in front of his sister's bed and woke up to find that he had been born again, three years earlier.
While he is happy that his sister is still healthy, he knows that he must make a lot of money and make a lot of money.
If she has enough money, she will be able to cure her sister's illness as soon as possible, and if she has enough money, she will be able to live a happy life as many of her peers do.
With money, you will exhale and never be inferior!
It is important to note that even if a person is born again, he or she will not be able to become rich.
All I could do seemed to be to play the game - the one he had played for more than two years, Dawn - which was only a few days away from opening.
He has given up the idea of finding a proper job, and today he comes out straight to the headquarters of the Starmoon Union, which he had served in his previous life.
It is not a game of the top ten, nor is it the first four seasons of China, it is just a game of a group of college students, and the leaders of the union are the rich rich second generation, because they can afford to spend money, so the development is also plausible.
It is one of the most beautiful places in the city, with the mountains, mountains, and mountains surrounding it, and there is an office building in the front and a residential area in the back, where only very wealthy people can establish a company.
At the front desk, the beautiful woman looked at the dress, dialed a series of numbers, and then told the woman to go in for the interview.
"We are currently recruiting only death squads, and the money takers are no longer being paid," said a young woman, dressed up in a fashionable outfit, with nail polish on her head, who was also in charge of the interview.
It is said that the death of a man is a matter of course, but it is also true that the death of a man is a matter of course.
In order to be able to play the game, the player must be able to earn enough points to be able to play the game, but they must also be able to earn enough points to be able to play the game.
"What, 20 gold!" the girl screams like a stepped cat as the nail polish is applied to her face.
Although it represents the most advanced virtual technology in the world and has the world's best design team, it is not confident enough to go public without the inside, but the content of the test is less, and it is a decentralized test and does not affect the normal game.
After a few days of testing, the player is most impressed by the fact that the coins are not very good to play, and that there are too many places to spend money.
The player must earn enough money to play the game, and the player must earn enough money to play the game.
Advanced professional players have estimated that it would take at least a week, or more, to save enough money to build a union for a hundred players to earn the right amount of money without the need to repair equipment and potions, which was the case before the game's third system update.
And this kid, he promised to give out 20 dollars in a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper.
"Have you ever been inside, have you ever found any money buggy?" asked the recruiter.
It is not a joke, it is a joke, it is a joke.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공'."
A short time later, he hears a sound of footsteps, and turns his head to look at the ground.
In addition to this, there are a number of other members of the board of directors, most of whom are members of the board of directors, and many of whom are members of the board of directors.
"Oh, don't tell me, this is the boy who can get 20 gold a week," the little man who walks beside the sword can not help but howl, the game is called half smoke, the leader of the Star Union thieves, is a very impatient person.
"Do you have a way to get 20 gold coins in a week and be sure it's the game of Dawn?"
He has a dark complexion, his clothes are wrinkled, and there are obvious signs of wear and tear at the corners, and he knows at first glance that he is the kind of person who crawls around at the bottom of society.
In the face of the enormous energy of the social elites, who had been gathered in the foreground, the land was no longer clamped by the small people at the bottom, but only a faint smile, and the calm eyes seemed to be filled with endless confidence.
CHAPTER I
"Yemer, Yemer, you're all right, hurry up, it's going to be a lesson, it's a lesson, hurry up," a somewhat urgent voice whispers in Yemer's ear, a strange feeling in Yemer.
"This idiot, who is supposed to be seen without a face, will cover his face." Another voice sounded in his ear, but Yemer woke up.
Yemer looked around at a dazed look, not knowing anyone, all strange faces.
When he saw that there was no way to stop him, he went to the door, opened it, and opened it; but when he saw that there was no way to stop him, he went to the door, opened it, and opened it.
When he finds out that he is the only one who has ever been in a relationship with someone else, he is shocked to see that he is still alive and that he is still alive.
"How is it like a school?" asked Yimer, somewhat stunned subconsciously.
"Haha..." was another loud laugh.
"Well, I don't know what you're talking about, but I think you're going to have to do something about it, and you're going to have to be careful."
In the end, it is revealed that he is not the only one who knows the truth, but that he is the only one who knows the truth, and that he is the only one who knows the truth.
In the final scene of the film, he is shown to have been killed by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen, and then by a group of gunmen.
When he is about three years old, he finds out that he is the only one who has ever lived, and that he is the only one who has ever lived, and that he is the only one who has ever lived, and that he is the only one who has ever lived.
His father, who had fallen into the hands of the West Gate, was unfathomable, and when he thought of it, he was no longer able to help himself, and suddenly stood up.
"What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell rings?" A young woman with a cold face came up to the stage with a few books, and glanced at the students below, laughing loudly.
It is known that this is a teacher of English classes, and the most annoying thing is that the students are coaxing, and once she looks at it, there is no good fruit to eat; Yehmer has already felt something is wrong, and although he understands the words, the obvious language is not his own, is it not the moon continent?
After the death of his father, Yimer was expelled from the Yeh family completely, specifically because he was not a member of the Yeh family; more precisely, after the death of his father, Yemi's blood was re-identified as not belonging to the Yeh family.
He has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng, who are not his mother, but his half-brother and sister; three years ago, his father seemed to know that he was indebted to Ye Mo, and he deliberately proposed marriage to Ye Mo, and Ye Tian asked him if he might know that he was not healthy, so he tried to find a patron for Ye Mo.
Of course, the Ning family was more than willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China.
During a medical examination in a hospital, Yimer was found to be impotent and, to put it bluntly, inhumane; although the Ye family tried to conceal the fact, it seemed that all the people in the city knew overnight that the Ye family of one of the Five Families of China had been impotent, and the Ye family had lost a big face.
"Ah..." the memory is turned over here, and Yemer screams, stands up, and almost immediately takes off his trousers to see if he has any idea that he could be reborn into a human being called Yemer, but he is inhumane, which would be better than killing him.
"That classmate, what's your name, what do you shout at class, go to my office after class," the beautiful teacher who was teaching was interrupted by Yemer's scream, and her face was very ugly.
The rest of the class was amused and allowed to go to the office of a university student, and it was assumed that only the English teacher's talent came out, and it was not possible to go, and the credits were in the hands of the people.
Although he does not know much about the inner workings of the family struggle, he does know that he was probably expelled from the Ye family because of his impotence, not necessarily because he was not a member of the Ye family, and who knows what to do with the DNA test.
Yimer is not worried about his expulsion from the Yeh family, which he does not care about at all, but about his own impotence.
But he also understood why the classmates in the class laughed, because his predecessor had been driven out of the Ye family, and he preferred to pursue Yanyan, the hottest girl in the class. As a result, people stuck their love letters on the blackboard, and then stood on the podium and looked at himself contemptuously, "Master Ye, can you go to bed with me?"
When he was told that he was going to die, he did not know what he was going to do, but when he was told that he was going to die, he did not know what he was going to do.
When he is reborn, he cannot understand a word of the lesson of the beautiful teacher on the stage, even if he understands it, he does not understand it, and he does not accept it for what he is now impotent, and it is better not to be reborn.
It is no longer a matter of going to college, but rather of figuring out where he is; his impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family, but who knows if he will suddenly be killed, or if there may be other insiders who caused his expulsion, is his safety still guaranteed?
After the school bell rings, Yimer's first thing is not to go to a beautiful teacher, but to rush out of the school and find a place to see his own little * *, which is not really impotent.
There is little else to do, but there is much to do in the village, and there is little to do in the village.
It is not true that he is not a bad person, but a bad person, and that he is not a bad person, but a bad person, and that he is a bad person.
In this case, however, it is difficult for a human being to dream of opening his blocked meridian with the current technology on Earth, but it is difficult for a human being to fail Yemer, although he has not yet been able to open the blocked meridian to make his own small * * strong, but as soon as he reaches the third level of Qi, the meridian will be automatically washed away.
In the end, it is only a matter of time before Yemer begins to be disappointed again, as it is a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of Qi in the thin atmosphere of the earth, and perhaps he will not be able to achieve it for the rest of his life, which would still be equivalent to impotence.
"I don't know," he said, "but I don't know," and he said, "I don't know," and he said, "I don't know," and he said, "I don't know, I don't know," and he said, "I don't know."
Yimer is not an exhibitionist, and since he has little capital exposure, he quickly pulls his pants up and flees.
"Yimer, what are you?" the woman screams and asks in a surprised tone, apparently knowing Yimer.
Chapter 1
The night is quiet, and the upper part of the city of Kōchi is quiet.
He sits quietly on a soft leather sofa, holding a stack of papers in his hand, looking out of the window at the swimming pool, full of loss and unhappiness.
He is the leader of one of the four major game studios in the city of Kim Jong-un, the leader of a large guild of tens of thousands of people, and the magician of the famous sword in the city of Kim Jong-un, but now he can only sit at home drinking and relieving his worries.
Ten years of gaming career.
"Ten Years of Blood."
After a long and painful struggle, the Council of State was finally led by the Shadow Council, which established ten cities in the Divine Realm, and was able to compete with the Council of State for the first time, enjoying an unending honor.
In the end, he becomes someone else's bride, because he opposes the incorporation of the Phantom into the Super League, and the next day, the Bluewater Foundation gives him a reply, deleting the 200 level Kenrei account that he spent 10 years on, and going to the treasury to settle the salary.
He received only five million credits and a mansion, compared to the ten city-states he had established, the virtual kingdoms he had created.
As a result, he was able to make a lot of money, and he was able to make a lot of money, so he was able to make a lot of money, so he was able to make a lot of money, and he was able to make a lot of money.
"I will never do that again."
In the middle of the book, a bottle of red wine is placed on the table, and a bottle of red wine is placed on the table.
Even without the Sword King account and the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him, and as long as the technology remains, he will be able to rise up in the divine realm and build his own virtual kingdom again.
In the morning, the sun rises.
Drops!
The phone rang again and again.
He wakes up in the middle of the night to find that his cell phone has been stolen, and that he has been sleeping since the night before.
"Well, what's the matter?"
"Fenggang, I'm a black boy, what do you ask? We're going to be professional players, today is the day of recruitment at the Shadow Studio in school, don't you always want to be a core member of the Shadow?"
The peak was a little confused.
How could he go to the shadowy examination when he had just been fired from the Bluewater syndicate?
Are you listening? They're going to test it at 10 o'clock, and it's too late for you to come over again! "
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
"How long have you been here?" he asked, "and how long have you been here?"
The phone rings, and the black man picks up the phone.
When he looks at the phone, he sees that the old man is crazy, not his phone at all, and that his phone is the latest crazy 12.
Then I looked around, and the little bedroom of less than 15 square meters was cluttered with books about game strategies, and the laptop in the corner desk, also a very backward old model, with clothes scattered in the big closet, and a familiar face in the dresser of the big closet.
When he saw the familiar face of the mountain, he was shocked.
He gets up and goes to the dressing room, takes a photo, and then realizes that he is really getting younger.
I was sleeping in a big, luxurious bedroom yesterday, and now I'm up, I'm in this broken place, and I'm getting younger.
I still have some memories of this place, where, ten years ago, I lived for more than half a year in a small house that I had rented for the Fourth of July, and where I made some money, I went to rent a big apartment in the city.
It is not uncommon for a family to have to pay a large sum of money in order to attend school, and it is not uncommon for a family to have to pay a large sum of money in order to attend school.
In order to improve his game skills, he bought a virtual helmet, which has become a professional player, and practiced hard in the virtual game.
When he went to the supermarket to buy bubble noodles, he had less than 10 credit points in his wallet, and he did not dare to buy even a single credit point of ham and sausage, and the saleswoman looked at the peak poor, recommended the special ham, the peak looked at the tempting ham, touched the wallet, or gritted her teeth, and refused.
"Who's kidding me?"
Peaks, looking at the familiar scene and the young self in the mirror, shook their heads and denied the idea.
Even the most developed countries in the United States do not have such a regression technique, who would joke with a lousy uncle.
I looked at the clock on the wall.
April 19, 2129.
"Am I born again?" he joked, with a bitter smile on his face.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, and could not have been in April 2129 when he was still in his senior year.
When he returns to his room, he finds himself in the middle of a fight, but when he returns to his room, he finds himself in the middle of a fight, and is forced to turn his back on the computer.
If the phone's time can be falsified, then the information on the Internet cannot be falsified.
A few minutes later, the door opened.
All the information he had on the Internet showed that today was indeed April 19, 2129, and even the official opening time of the fiery world of God was clearly written on the official website that the countdown was April 25, six days later.
"Did I really go back ten years?" Pinnacle stared at the news coverage of God's presence, leaving tears of excitement in his eyes.
At the end of the series, the character is shown to have feelings of regret, sadness and joy.
It was as if she had never seen him before.
However, the sound of the cicadas outside the window, and the air conditioning blowing out of the air, remind the peak that all this is true.
Looking at the pictures of the family in college on the cell phone, he never found out that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles in the corners of her eyes, and that they were really old and not as energetic as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the Holy Land, and high debt, excessive labor and stress, made both parents seriously ill and sick, and it would take several million credits to recover, but at that time the peak was only a small captain of the shadow, and the money earned could not pay such a high cost.
In order to raise money, Peaks tried to do everything, but unfortunately it was not enough, even if Peaks tried to maintain it, the parents left a few months later.
He did not take good care of his parents in his previous life, and who knows the pain and remorse?
Even after earning millions of credits, it became a permanent pain in the heart of the peak.
I didn't want to make a joke out of it, so I went back to the beginning.
"Well, that's great, haha. Now that I'm born again, I'm going to change all this, earn enough money to cure my parents, and not let them work on their lives." The peak wiped tears from his eyes and swore in a dark oath.
As he plans his own future, Black's phone rings again, prompting him to take the exam at the university.
However, he does not hurry, puts on his clothes, and picks himself up before going to the University of Jinhae.
He could not have been more familiar with the shadows.
When he was in high school, he became a member of the school's board of trustees, and when he became a member of the board of trustees, he became a member of the board of trustees, and when he became a member of the board of trustees, he became a member of the board of trustees.
Three years later, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, but was not promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and was eventually promoted to the rank of captain.
When he is reborn, he has an incomparable advantage over others in the divine realm, he is naturally not ready to join the shadows, become a tool for others, make money for others, he has to walk a different path, struggle for his own life, do not let his parents send money, pay off all debts, so he has to start his own business, open his own studio, create his own virtual empire, live a good life.
When he arrived at Building 1, he saw a tall, skinny, dark-skinned young man walking up and down the front door, impatient.
"You're finally here," said the black man, "but we're not done yet, so let's hurry in and sign up."
He shook his head and said, "I'm not going to go to the shadows, I'm going to open my own studio, are you coming?"
It is said that he was a good player in the game, but if he was a good player, he would be able to win the game, but if he was a good player, he would be able to win the game, but if he was a good player, he would be able to win the game, and if he was a good player, he would be able to win.
A minute later, the black man looked up at the peak.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공'."
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy a virtual headset for the Divine Domain right now," Pinnacle nodded, admitting, as Kuroko said, that 780,000-plus people were missing. I remember that the 100-person studio that Blue Dragon recruited cost more than five million, and later it cost a lot to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
"If that is the case, why should we risk it? To go to the shadows is not more stable, at least it provides a virtual helmet, or else we will not even be able to play, let alone become professional players." Black, seeing that Pininfarina understood the problem, breathed a sigh of relief and pulled Pininfarina into the school building.
"But I'm going to open my own studio, and I don't want to be restrained. Are you coming?"
He does not have the ability to tell the truth, but he does not have the ability to tell the truth, and he does not have the ability to tell the truth.
It is not uncommon for a black man to see a black man in the form of a black man, but it is common for a black man to see a black man in the form of a black man, and to see a black man in the form of a black man, and to see a black man in the form of a black man.
Black hesitates for a long time, bites his teeth, and finally promises, "I know, who made you a big brother, and I'm opening a studio with you, but what about virtual helmets, without which we can't play games?"
"Now, my good brother, don't worry about the virtual helmet," he said, "I remember that there was a special offer for university students in Shintoku, and every university had a special offer, so long as you had a student card, you could get a virtual helmet for free for ten days. Let's go and see."
Why do you believe in Pinnacles? Is it the confidence and security of Pinnacles? Is it really okay to start a business with Pinnacles?
What Can You Do in 10 Days?
Ten days later, we will surely miss the opportunity to recruit people from the studios, and in the end we will not be buying virtual helmets, but how will the money come?
If you want to earn 16,000 credits in the first ten days, you can't do it even if you're a professional player!
"Give it to me."
He smacked the black man on the shoulder with a confident smile.
Earning 16,000 Credits in ten days would have been a whim, but he had the guts to be a reincarnation, one that he would break in the face of any difficulty, and the opening of the divine realm was the beginning of his rise.
In the end, the two of them decide to go to a restaurant, where they can buy food, drink, and drink, and then go to a restaurant, where they are given a glass of wine and a glass of wine to drink.
At nine o'clock in the evening of April 25, there was a glimmer of light in the dark, silent cabin.
Stones lay still in bed, eyes closed, and a light click on the start button of the helmet.
"God, I'm here."
I can't tell what it is, and I can't help but shudder in the cold of this snowy night when I hear the sound of my ears going through my body and into my soul.
The wind blows through the heavens and the earth, and the snow splits the heavens and splits the earth, and the earth is covered with a layer of water, and the land is desolate if it is covered with silver.
It is not late at night, but just at dusk, but the sky is as dark as the night, giving a sense of heaviness, as if it were suffocating, and on the silver earth, a great silhouette can be seen, a mighty city, like the presence of a great beast.
In the center of the city, there is a towering, towering altar, shaped like a seven horns, with a black body, straight into a cloud peak, towering in the blizzard, the sound of the whipping wind that has been blown on the altar, mixed with the sound of Karakala, scattered far away, with the original rugged, there is no melody.
The sound of a hoarse murmur, drifting out of the altarpiece in the wind and snow, seemed to merge with the wind, and was a little indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where do I want it, if there is no hope, why do I see it!"
There are hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, all around the altar, and there is no movement, but there is a fervor that emerges, like a man on the altar, who can give all he has.
The snow is much bigger.
"If you let me see it, there will be hope, but where is the hope?" The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, full of sorrow, and lingering.
"And now," he said, "there is no one in the world who knows what is going on in the world, nor what is going on in the world, nor what is going on in the world, nor what is going on in the world, nor what is going on in the world, nor what is going on in the world.
There is no more snow falling in the sky, and all the snow condenses to form a huge snow dragon, which is immediately agitated by the formation of the dragon, and the voice is so loud that everyone who hears it immediately shakes their hearts and seems to be torn by the sound.
The blood drips out from the snow dragon's body, and soon it fills the entire body of the snow dragon, making it a blood-dragon, which roars violently and struggles its body toward the sky, like a shooting star piercing into the sky, as if to open a hole and open a hope.
It is said that the soul of the soul, the soul of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul, the body of the soul.
At the moment when it is about to be completely broken, hundreds of thousands of silent people under the altar, all hands clenched, gnawing the tip of the tongue, spewing a mouthful of blood, which seemed to be pulled by some kind of force, springing up like a sea of blood, and going straight to the collapsing blood dragon, fused with it, so that the dragon's collapse was moderated and rushed to the higher horizon.
It is said that the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land, and the blood of all the people of the land.
And at this moment, the moment of the Blooddragon's collapse, a different voice came out of its mouth!
At the top of the altar, in the very centre, sat an old man in a purple robe, his face wrinkled and covered with brown spots, his eyes murmuring open, but dimly lit, apparently a blind man.
He had a full spine in front of him, which gave off a white crest, and a stone tablet in his right hand, which rested on the thirteenth spine.
He looked at the sky in silence, and sighed for a long, long time.
In his speech, his right hand, which was holding a piece of stone, moved again on the strange spine, rubbing the animal bone, and making a sound of KAZZAMZAM, he scattered far away, and his figure was conspicuous, and he fused with this sound, revealing a sad loneliness and downfall.
At night, it is dark, and in the mountains, it is not calm, and wild beasts appear, and the roar shakes the mountains and rivers, and the trees tremble, and the leaves fall in a rustle.
In the darkness of the night, when the sun shines on the earth, and the moon shines upon the earth, the moon shines upon the earth, and the moon shines upon it.
"I'm not going to let you go," he said, "but I'm going to let you go, and I'm going to let you go, and I'm not going to let you go."
Ling came back, did not speak, slapped his butt, stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man groaned, "It's useless waste, not as strong as a child, so throw him into the mountains and let the beast eat him!"
How can a brother, who has passed through the earth, compare his strength to that of your cattle?
This world is a world ruled by the Realm of Truth.
The village is a small village in the middle of the mountains, and there is no one to practice truthfulness, but everyone, including women and children, is hard at work.
Only in this way can we survive in a world where the beast is rampant, and even where there are ancient remains.
As in the present day, although it is late at night, the village's young people also go to the mountains to hunt, and many game animals are accustomed to going out at night, and although it is dangerous to go into the mountains at night, the harvest will be much greater.
The people of the village have become accustomed to this way of life, and the children who remain in the village do not sleep, but gather together to play more skillfully and wait for the return of the hunters.
In addition, a group of young men who are not yet old enough to be able to play the game, and a group of young men who are about ten years old, are trying to figure out who will be able to lift the giant tripod that weighs a thousand pounds.
Ling Feng looked at the small animals and sighed, and with more strength than they did, he really seemed to be wasting wood.
But this does not frustrate Lin, who, despite being talked about behind his back from time to time, finds himself living in a small mountain village called Wolf's Village. What really bothers him is that there is something in his mind.
Supervisor System.
At the beginning, Lin Feng was very happy, thinking that there was a good thing to go through, but the system said that the first one made him feel cold.
"The main mission of the system: the host to open the mountain, to establish the world's first master, to become the first master."
"There are different stages of the main mission, and each stage has to be completed within a limited time, and the time limit is not completed, and the host is simply wiped out!"
Lin looked at the system's instructions, especially the last sentence, "Erase the host," and was speechless until he pulled a few words out of his mouth: "I bought a watch last year!"
In the end, it is revealed that he is the only one who has ever been killed, and that he is not going to die, but that he is going to die, and that he is not going to die again.
Main line task 1.0 - Adopting four private students.
Mission Statement: The most important resource of a school is always a person, a gifted disciple, a great teacher, a great teacher, a great teacher, a great teacher, a great teacher, and a great teacher.
Time limit: One year, not completed, directly kill the host.
"Well," said the old man, "I am going to be a good man, and I'm going to be a good man, and I'm going to be a good man, and I'm going to be a good man.
If you want me to teach you how to be a good teacher, how to be a good teacher, how to be a good teacher, how to be a good teacher, how to be a good teacher, how to be a good teacher and how to be a good teacher.
In addition to this, it is important to keep in mind that there is a risk that the system will fail if the system fails, and that the system will fail if the system fails, and that the system will fail.
It's all about the good, the good, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng doesn't have even a single exchange point at the moment, so he has to turn the system upside down.
Ling was scolding in his heart, and the village suddenly became agitated, as if the hunting party had returned.
The young men who were waiting in the village cheered and greeted them at the entrance of the village, and Lin Feng looked indifferent, but was shocked to find that the young men who had returned from the hunt had all returned empty-handed, and that there was no game to say, not even a weapon was missing.
For these villagers, weapons are second life, living in the mountains and not being able to survive without them.
Lin's beak snapped an inconspicuous smile: "There seems to be a story." Thinking of it, he walked towards the village entrance.
Before we got close, we heard someone yelling, "The wolf wind is the hope of our wolf village, and now it is seriously injured by the people of Ishimura, we must not give up!"
Ling Feng looked up and saw a young boy sitting on the ground in the middle of the crowd, his face full of bruises and a cold glow of hatred in his eyes.
"Is this the genius of the wolf village?" Lin Feng sneaks in and observes that the wolf wind has been known for a long time, and the idol of the wolf village children is regarded as the hope of the village, and Lin Feng is the first person to see the real person today.
Although he is physically strong and strong, he is not physically strong enough to stand up to the enemy, even if he is physically strong enough.
In the case of the world of the gods, this is the world of the gods, and in the case of the gods, it is the world of the gods, and the world of the gods, and the world of the gods.
Ling Feng-liang unobtrusively calls out his supermaster system, which has a student talent detector inside, and he presses it against the wolf wind.
"The subject is too poorly qualified to be a host pupil."
The system was so critical that Lin frowned and frowned at the idea that he would take in four apprentices at random to fool the system through that one-year period, and that it would be a big deal to eject them from the wall.
But now, it seems that it is not so easy to exploit the loopholes of the system, even a talented boy who is famous as a wolf wind is not qualified, and Lin Feng wants to collect four apprentices to complete the system task, which is too difficult.
"A year, a year, a year..."
In the midst of the crowd, an old man beside the wolf wind, with an iron-faced face, hummed, "The wolf wind is my grandson, of course this is not the case, but it is not the case now. In recent days, the mountains have been quiet, it looks like a mountain treasure is about to be born, first get the mountain treasure, and then settle the accounts with Ishimura!"
There is often a struggle between the village clans, and Lin Feng is not interested in it, but rather the word "mountain" in his ears, which makes him move slightly.
"I don't know how Ishimura raised such a small monster, a little doll under the age of four, who could defeat the genius wolf wind in our village," Lin Feng was thinking about the mountain treasure, suddenly heard someone in the crowd scolding in a low voice, "I do not know how Ishimura raised such a small monster, a little doll, who could defeat the genius wolf wind in our village!"
He opened his eyes.
A little doll under the age of four, who beat the wolf wind?
What kind of talent is the Wolf Wind, who was wounded by a man less than four years old?
The little fat man next to Lin Feng scolded in a low voice, "Damn little devil, you must kill him!"
"Yes, yes," he said.
In his mind, however, he is thinking that the little doll might be approved by the system, and that Lin Fang would like to fly to Ishimura at once, but he does not dare to leave the village alone, otherwise he will simply feed the beast in the mountains.
At this point, the sound of a mechanical scream suddenly sounded in the foreground.
"Newbie package released, do you see it now?"
After a brief pause, he was overjoyed and never felt that the dull, dull sound of the system was so pleasant to hear.
To find a place where no one is available, open the bag.
For example, a player can earn four points by winning a prize, one point by winning a prize, one point by winning a prize, one point by winning a prize, one point by winning a prize, one point by winning a prize.
Ling stayed a while, a warm current fell from the top of his head, running between his chest and stomach, and quickly burst out of a hidden hole in his body.
There are twelve major caves hidden in the human body, called the Twelve Towers by the healers.
The practice of the Qi period is divided into twelve floors in order to open the Twelve Storeyed Building. Each hole is opened, the Reiki is transformed into the Dharma power, and the practitioner's Dharma power goes up a step.
Lin Feng now feels a warm current of war, walking all the way, until it disappears after opening four holes in his body. As Lin Feng breathes, the outside world's energy is rapidly sucked into his body, circling in the four holes that have been opened.
Each hole is like a rotating cluster universe, where the spirit is constantly transformed into the magic of Lin Feng himself, just as the universe was first opened and all living things evolved.
Ling Feng felt that his entire body was becoming light, and his mind was moving, and the power of the hole was like a spring, and the explosive power was moving.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and his heart was relieved: "At least a little self-reliant," but he thought that the ultimate goal of the system was to build the first gate in history, and he wanted to be the first patriarch in history, and Lin Feng was under great pressure when he was the first, and he was quick to check other things in the novice package.
"What is it?," he asked, "is it possible that there is no such thing in the world?," and he replied, "There is no such thing in the world."
For the time being, it can only be hoped that the 300 exchange points will have a higher purchasing power.
As a result, he was unable to find a job, and he was forced to pay a fine.
In the first round of the competition, the contestants were given 10 points, 10 points, and 30 points for a sword.
It is also possible to set a time limit of 50 minutes for a single star.
It is the most common form of the word "fire," such as "fire," "fire," or "fire."
When they arrive at the house, they are surprised to find that no one is looking at them, and they are afraid to look at each other.
Lin looked at the pitiful 300 in his "existing redemption points" column and shook his head: "Too little start-up money."
It is revealed that he has been given a secret book and a magic spell, or else he will be blinded.
It is important to note that the primary purpose of the practice is to improve the quality of life, and that the practice of the practice is to improve the quality of life, especially in the areas of physical and mental health.
It is important to note that there is a very high level of security in the system, and that the system can only be upgraded once the system is in place.
As for the system upgrade, it requires Lin to complete a number of system tasks before it can be started, which is a long time ago.
It is one of the world's most famous and most famous works of art, although it has been lost for many years, and many of its most famous works have been lost.
As a result, the number of people in the village has increased, and the number of people in the village has increased, with the number of people in the village having increased to 300, and the number of people in the village has increased to 300.
If there is no such thing as a top law, and if there is no such thing as a damned main line mission, Lin Feng must first find a place where no one can practice a divine work before coming out to kill the four.
But now that we're going to get apprentices, that's another story.
Dissatisfied, Lin quickly adjusted his mind and moved quickly.
He leaves the village unharmed after asking the path to the stone village.
The two men are now in a state of enmity, and Lin Feng, who has become a monk, is not afraid of the wolves, but is afraid that they will reveal their identity in front of the Ishimura people.
Fortunately, the wolves gathered at the entrance to the village, where there was a lot of discussion about how the wolves had been injured, and Lin Feng walked around from behind the village, not noticing his movements.
On the way, Lin Feng did not hesitate to invest directly in 50 exchange points and set up a head for himself.
How could it be that Lin Feng from the Earth does not know the truth of "Buddha's money, people's clothes" and wants to sell things, publicity and packaging must be done first.
He is shown to have a black beard, a black beard, a black beard, a black beard, a black beard, and a black beard, but he does not know what to do with himself.
When he arrived at the mouth of the village, he was first seen by a large dead tree with a diameter of 10 meters and a black trunk.
It is believed that the tree was cut by lightning many years ago, and the old tree's huge canopy and thriving life have been destroyed, leaving only an 89-meter-high stump on the surface.
But the size of the existing tree trunks alone makes it possible to imagine how large the tree would have been if it had lived.
There is no sign of life.
Then an old man came up, coughing and saying, "This tree has been dead for ten years," and he went up to Lin Feng, looking up and down in his eyes, "The old man is the mayor of this stone village, and I don't know what he can do to help him."
He is shown to be a tall man, with a long beard, a long beard, a long beard, a long beard, a long beard, and a long beard.
"Discover the goal, suitable for the host to be a personal disciple."
When he heard the sound of the bell ringing, he almost choked.
The old man looked at the old man with a strange look, but was terrified.
In the middle of the night, he sees two wolves staring at him as if they were starving.
The village mouth, a powder-sculpted cock-pecker, a lovely, snow-white child, is pulling the tail of a large yellow dog, and the child's voice is loud and clear: "Baby, don't run!"
The system sound in Lin Feng's mind kept saying: "The talent system has been sorted out, the number one target information is as follows."
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동 X 한끼성공 (종합)."
"In summary: the goal is extremely gifted, it is recommended that income, careful teaching, will be the foundation of the family."
He can't see anything else, and looks straight at the red number "10" behind the bone.
What does the root of 10 mean?
For example, if someone else runs a hundred metres from the starting point to the finish line, and the finish line is the same, the little one starts at ninety metres!
No wonder that the wolf he can beat when he is less than four years old is full of peach blossoms.
It is also possible to see the eyes of a blind man, and to see the eyes of a blind man, and to see the eyes of a blind man.
It is said that he is not only a good man, but also a good man, a good man, a good man, a good man and a good man.
Is it a bit of pressure to be an apprentice in this business?
As the sun rises, a smile appears on his face.
If a person who is familiar with Lin Feng in his previous life sees this smile, he will surely be far away at once.
Chapter 1
In the morning, the sun shines through the silvery veil and falls on the bed, stabbing her eyes open.
At the end of the night, she is very happy to see him, and he takes her back to his house.
When the time comes, the thin silk slips off, a red stain appears on the white sheet, and the skin of his body is covered with kissing marks.
It is believed to be the result of a night of mourning.
"I love you."
In the depths of his heart, he spoke as if he were still whispering in his ear. Time was running out, his eyes were shady, and he looked around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
When the legs are in contact with the ground, they become weak and fall to the ground.
When the light came out again, Luoyang also returned, and slowly walked into the living room, with a slender figure with a strong and oppressive atmosphere.
When the eyes are closed, the eyes are closed, and the eyes are closed.
It was the first time in his life that he had such a close relationship, and he was so shy that he could not even look at him.
In the confusion, she vaguely hears him say that he wants to surprise her.
Are you going to propose to her?
The heart beats violently and the heart beats violently.
As she spoke, she was interrupted by the silence of Lu Yanchen: "Break up!"
What did he just say, break up?
He wants to surprise her, break up?
Is he teasing her, joking, or really, breaking up?
A cry of the utmost pain, hidden in the throat, half ringing, time to recover its own voice,
"Break up, after we have a relationship... after that, Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?"
"I'm sorry," she said, "but I don't know what you're going to do to me, and I'm not going to let you go."
The Time Is Not Enough
She was stunned, and looking at a man so different from the one she remembered, trembling uncontrollably, she asked the three words, "Why?"
Then he looked out of the window and smiled.
The smile on his face was like a joke.
Her face was as white as snow, and the pain started from the heart, pressing the nerve endings to the body of the body, and the darkness like a stun came on, and she pinched the palm of her finger tightly, and did not let herself faint.
The air suddenly became cold and damp, and the cold made the person shiver and suffocate and could not stay for more than a minute.
The time is gone.
Chapter 1
In the middle of the night, rain falls on the town.
It took him ten years to recover, but he was eventually reborn.
For a strong man of nature, it takes ten seconds to be sure of something, which is absolutely inconceivable, but it also proves how inconceivable what happened to him.
He was one of the founders of a new movement known as the "Three Flames," which led to a revolution in the realm of alchemy known as the "Dante."
However, he is not satisfied, and wants to go further to reach the legendary void, shattered by the void, and transformed into a god, for which he visits numerous monuments, and finally enters the Black Blood Valley, where he finds a mysterious tower after a lot of danger.
He is the only one who can do this, and he is the only one who can do it, and he is the only one who can do it, and he is the only one who can do it, and the only one who can.
Even if it is not the case, it is still possible to read the book as if it were a book, but as if it were a book.
He forcefully memorizes this exercise, and as he is about to study the tower, the tower vibrates lightly, releasing an immeasurable light that instantly shatters his body, but strangely enough, his soul does not dissipate and falls into a state of wakefulness and dreaminess that has lasted for thousands of years.
For ten thousand years, his soul has been speculating on the Book of Heaven, which he cannot do except for this, and after ten thousand years, he finally grasps the first layer of this practice.
What is the concept of a strong man who has taken 10,000 years to understand the first dimension of a practice?
It is not uncommon for a person to die in the first year of life, and it is not uncommon for a person to die in the first year of life, even if he or she has not yet died.
In this way, he was able to master the first level of practice of the Book of Heaven in a strange way, and then he suddenly came back to life and was reborn in a 16-year-old boy who was also called "Rei."
"Whatever it is, I'm alive again!"
"But I was once a strong man, and stood at the top of the martial art, and was a master of the Dan Tao, and the poor qualifications were supplemented by the Dan medicine, and I did not believe that I could return to the peak."
"And, at last, I shall be able to cultivate the Heavenly Sutra, which is a supreme practice, and even... may not be possessed by the world, but by the world of the gods of legend; otherwise, how could it take 10,000 years to understand the first practice?"
"In this life, I will surpass my predecessors and attain the throne of God!"
"And what is the matter with this body, that it was only sixteen years old when it was cultivated to the second level of the body of the practitioner? Is it because the martial art of today is too weak?"
In the process, two completely different people are fused together and become indistinguishable from each other.
"I understand."
It is revealed that he is the only one in the series, and that he is the only one in the series, due to the fact that he has a bad temper.
One of the prerequisites for becoming a warrior in cultivation is to have a spiritual root, which allows you to absorb the spiritual energy of the heavens and the earth, to harden your body, and to become your own energy.
There are four levels, each of which is divided into the upper, middle, and lower levels, with the highest being the highest and the lowest the lowest being the yellow.
It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation. {\ displaystyle\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}}\ {\ mathcal {transformation}} {\ mathcal {transformation}}}.
This is the first time in the history of the universe that a person has been able to live in a world where he or she has lived for more than a hundred years, and where he or she has lived for more than a hundred years, and where he or she has lived for more than a hundred years.
"This is the lowest spiritual root of the five elements, and it is no wonder that its predecessor, despite his great efforts, was only the second level of the practice." "For me, the five elements are a bit tricky, but with the help of medicine, I will certainly be able to return to the peak for up to 400 years!"
"Why!"
In his mind, he is shown to have an unbelievable expression of shock, and after a while, he looks back at his spiritual roots in Dandan with a strong spirit, and the expression of shock turns into joy.
"This is not a mixed root of the five elements, but a perfect balance of the five elements, forming a Daolian! This is a chaotic lotus in the five elements, the best of the best, even rarer than the nine yang fire spirit root, which can be called a divine spirit root!"
"And I... have mastered the five elements of chaotic lotus that match the five elements!"
"One hundred years! No, it will take only fifty years before I can return to human form!"
It is said that he was born in the land of the living, and that he was born in the land of the dead, and that he was born in the land of the living, and that he was born in the land of the dead, and that he lived in the land of the living.
At the end of the series, he is revealed to be the one who created the immortal Mythos.
"How did the antecedents die?"
It was cold, and he picked up his memory, and soon he became angry.
He was the only son of the Ling family, and his mother, grandfather, and grandmother died very early, while the Ling family was a family of martial arts, and every member of the clan practiced martial arts and also respected martial arts, like the Ling family What can sit on the position of the master of the house?
As a result of the cold weather, it was considered a waste of time and was eaten with white eyes.
In order to give his son a bright future, Ling Dongxing and Tiger Yang College reached an agreement that Tiger Yang College would recruit Ling as a disciple and train him, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing would go into the Purple Light Valley to find something that had been lost long ago for Tiger Yang College.
The school was founded in the late 19th century and is run by the king of the rain, and its resources are numerous, so if the school is to be fully developed, it will be able to raise the number of people who have lost their jobs.
But the people of Huyang College could not be idiots, and if that was a good thing, how could they have offered such excellent terms?
It is possible that he may have been killed, but it is possible that he may have been killed, or that he may have been killed, for the sake of his son, seven days before his departure.
At this time, however, Ling's chief deacon, Ling, ran over to his predecessor and asked him to release the precious position and give it to his grandson, Ling Mo Yun.
The reason for this is that he is a genius and has no future, and such an opportunity cannot be wasted.
It is said that he did not know his father's name, but it is said that he was the father of his son, and that he did not know his father's name, but that he was the father of his son.
He is the only one who can do this, but he is the only one who can do it, and he is the only one who can.
With just one punch, the predecessor was seriously wounded, and then locked up in his room, apparently not wanting to disturb him in front of the Huyang Academy, and by the time Ling Dong came back, the tree was already in the boat.
It was the first time I had seen him.
It was the first time that he had ever been in such a position, and it was the first time that he had ever been in such a position.
What a shameful dog!
Intolerable!
When he got up from his bed, he felt pain all over his body - he was alive, but the wounds on his body did not heal without cause.
"I'm sorry," he said, "but I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of medicine that can repair the spiritual root, but four of the materials needed are too expensive to sell the whole Ling family in exchange for it - and my spiritual root is only lightly invented and does not need such advanced medicine."
"The other three, the two that need to be refined into Dan, are too forced to do what I am doing now in the second level of the body. There is only one choice - to reanimate, just mix the herbs proportionally, and boil them into juice."
"I don't know," he said, "but I don't know, I don't know, and I don't know, I don't know."
He sat down on his knees and began to work the "undead book."
This is the first time that he has been able to do so, although he has been able to do so for thousands of years.
As a result, his body was severely damaged, and he was able to recover quickly.
Within a few minutes, he was completely healed of his injuries.
"It is true that I have not destroyed the celestial scriptures, and I have only just begun to practice them. But this is quite different from other exercises, where the normal method is to use the spiritual root to transform the spirit of heaven and earth into the energy, whereas the opposite is true for the celestial scriptures, which harden the body and heal the wounds."
"It is not impossible not to die when you reach the highest level." "That is why it is called the celestial book!" "It is a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I will be able to restore the spiritual roots of the celestial book without destroying it."
She opened her eyes, looked out of the window, and murmured, "Now, it's time to go to the unassuming old goods, and give him a surprise."
He put on his shoes, went to the door and opened it.
At the door, a tall figure appears to block his way, who is called Zhang Yuan, and is one of the heaviest walking dogs.
"If you are in the house," he said, "you are in the house; if you are in the house, you are in the house; if you are in the house, you are in the house.
He looked at her and said, "What are you doing here?"
He said, "I will not let you go; I will not let you go; I will not let you go; I will not let you go; I will not let you go."
The old dog is very cautious, and it is not safe to beat him severely, and it is also possible to see how important it is for the grandson to enter the Tiger Sun Academy - but when this hope is dashed, the disappointment and anger of the bear can also be imagined.
"Get out of the cold!."
Bang!
"What are you doing?" he asked. "What are you doing?"
What is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this?
Bang!
It was cold again, and he shook his head in disbelief.
"What? - What?."
The sound of the shout echoed in the silent hills.
Li climbed the hill on the seventh night, the wind was cold and hot, but he was anxious and sweaty, and at the age of 13, he climbed the mountains with his hands and feet, and the night was particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night is terrible, Li is in a hurry at night.
At the age of seven, he was raised by a family of farmers, and his parents were poor.
In the evening, when he was driving back home, he found that he had lost a sheep, which could have ruined him in a hurry, and he hurried back to the hill to look for it, but he did not find the sheep.
When they arrive at the house, they find that a sheep has been lost, and that the sheep have been lost for seven days.
Now the whole mountain has been searched, there is no shadow of the sheep, at this time, Li seven nights thought of a place, only a place to look for - the cave of the devil!
In the night of the first day of the month, the sun shines, and the moon shines, and the moon shines, and the sun shines, and the moon shines, and the moon shines, and the moon shines.
In the Book of Revelation, it is said that there is a demon inside, and if anyone enters, he will be eaten, and if anyone enters, he will never live.
But, at this point, the crackling whip of Zhang Dahuo reverberated in Li's ear, and he lost a sheep, and Zhang Dahun would surely have sucked him to pieces!
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good!"
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공 '한끼성공'."
"Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly."
After that, between the heavens and the earth, there was a raven flying, burial place, into the fairyland, across the evil realm...
Time passes, times change, an invincible character rises, one giant after another falls, and slowly, unsure of what time * *, a mysterious raven begins to appear, a mysterious raven that has escaped captivity and begins to search for a way to control its own destiny.
From the gods of medicine, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, to the fairies, and finally to the king of the black dragons.
For generations, the gods have been gone, but for millennia, the raven has remained hidden in the river.
The wind is cold and the snow is heavy.
As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw himself sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, which was slightly swaying, with the sound of a little girl speaking softly.
Outside the car, there was a loud noise of people shouting, shouting and cheering.
He took a deep breath.
He knows he can't go back, and wakes up from a drunken drunken drunkenness in an old piece of oil mixed in with death in a state-owned enterprise.
It's been five days now.
He sniffs his nose, the smell of wine, burning bread, and fried fruit in the air.
"Oh, the white cinnamon is getting more and more fragrant," said the valet in the carriage.
Add to that the fact that she was born with a baby face and a small head, and she looks no different from a ten-year-old.
He is dressed in a red, green, and green dress, and his hair is tied to a rope that is tied to his head.
It is made of an expensive crossbar, which naturally gives off a faint fragrance, but the only downside is that it hardens in cold weather and requires a hot hand to rub it softly.
He smiled and did not speak, and the carriage soon stopped.
He opened the car curtain and got out of the car, and on the gray-white street lay a block of lapis lazuli, each the size of a washbasin.
The streets were full of cars and people carrying Malays to and fro, and the vendors, the girls and their dependants who had come out to hang out, were laughing and laughing.
Lu Sheng looked up at the wine cellar in front of him. The white plaque was rectangular, and in the middle of it was written three big letters: The laurel flower cellar.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공 (종합)."
In the middle of the room, a man with a black beard, a white beard, and a black beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard, and a white beard.
He went to the door and opened it.
There are two rooms on the first floor, where many people sit and listen to music.
A young girl in a green suit stands in the middle of the room, and a middle-aged woman plays the pipa.
The song is about the love between a man and a woman.
There are only a handful of people who can understand it, and the rest of the group are unaware of the two girls.
When he stopped and looked at the ground floor, he found an empty spot on the ground floor.
"Who are you?" he asked.
He has a different status in the Guild, and if the Guild is the equivalent of a high-class entertainment club on Earth, he is the ultimate vip customer here.
In the north of the country, there is a small town of nine, which is the largest in terms of population.
"It's a long story."
He did not want to hurt him, so he threw him out.
He sat down and looked around the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale skinny boy in a white robe, holding a golden lotus leaf folding fan in his hand and gently shaking it.
He shook his head and said, "I don't know."
"It's been a long time since I've told you that this guy is a bad guy!"
He starts to laugh and stop talking, and begins to listen to the music.
On the dark red wooden table, a dish of wine is quickly placed on the table, and Passion is sandwiched between a pair of fried lettuce fillets and placed in his mouth.
Drink a glass of white cinnamon, mixed with a hint of sweet flowers, and drink a juice.
In the northern part of the city, ice shrimp are a specialty, and when caught in a thick ice hole, they can produce a large number of translucent shrimps.
Ice shrimp are about half the length of ordinary shrimp, but taste very good.
Of course, the price is also very expensive.
It is a luxury for an ordinary person to eat once a month, and there is no place like him to eat.
They eat, drink, and listen to each other.
He has been in this world for so many days, similar to ancient China, but, as he observes, it has a lot of oddities.
At first he thought he had returned to antiquity, but later realized that he was not.
The customs and the festive climate were far different from any of the dynasties he knew.
Once again, the door to the restaurant was opened.
A group of men dressed in short trousers came in one after another and sat down at a table near the corner.
These men were known to be natives, and their dress was more like that of the Central Plains than that of the North.
A strong man, with a bald head, with copper earrings, and a fleshy face, sighed. "
"Big brother is worried, Li Jiacun can not pass, we can take the second way, it is okay to go around from the Zhang village side," another man frowned.
"What do you know, when I came to the rendezvous, I walked on the side of Zhang Village, which was about the same as Li Jia Village, and a lot of people died."
"What the hell is going on," one man exhorted, "you tell your brothers to listen, and let us learn more."
"I don't know what it is," he sighed, "but I know that several fishing villages on the shores of Lake Suiyang have gone astray, as if they were haunted by water."
"No?"
They are not far from each other and can be heard chatting undisguised.
He did not know what to do, and he did not know what to do.
His family was one of the largest in the northern part of the country, and his wealth was very small.
To put it in a comparison on Earth, it is at least the billionaire.
In the past, he has been known to drink a lot of wine, but most of it is a legend.
This was the first time they had ever had such an experience, so Passion raised his ear and listened carefully.
"Well, I don't want to talk about it," he said.
"That water demon, I saw with my own eyes, tall and blue-faced, covered with a lot of water and grass, my dear, you would not want to see me now if your brother had not run so fast."
"Do you really believe in water?."
"Afraid it's not your big brother's story?"
It was funny to hear that, too, and I suppose it was just the brazen bragging about where it had come from.
After eating and drinking, he asked the servant to take the song list and read it at will.
It's a good idea, but it's not going to be a good idea, so I'm going to change it.
Bang!
At the same time, however, the head of the bald man became red and hit the table.
"A bone that fell on the ground! It was secretly picked up by me!"
He carefully removed a jade-like green stone from his arms and photographed it on the table.
"It's not a joke!," a man laughs.
"Is it a jade?."
"Can you show me how to do it?"
A soft voice came from the other side.
With a smile on his face, he stands at the table of several people, looking over the green jade on the table.
"Do you want this thing? It's left behind by a ghost of water."
He is also shown to be in a coma for a while, and is about to die.
After all, it is not a thing that people leave behind.
"I'll take a look," he said. "I don't believe in jade, just look at the jade, not the ordinary jade."
It is possible to buy them anywhere in the market, and the price is very low.
I don't know what it is, but when I look at it, it looks like something is wrong.
He wears a white shirt, a black shirt, and a pair of black shoes.
A dress can be spent in this flower shop for a few months. Even ordinary people can live for more than a year.
"No, no, no, no, no, no!
He put it on the table.
The bald head resolutely picks up the jade to win the battle, and several of them change their eyes and leave.
A few of the men went away, clasped the stone in their hands, and looked up.
"That is how rich I have been in my whole life." He shook his head, and a penny or two was nothing to him, and according to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses on weekdays were as low as a hundred or more, and occasionally as high as a thousand or two.
At the same time, he lost his mind.
With the jade in his hand, he does not look at the crowd around him, but leaves the bar on his feet and walks towards the wagon waiting outside.
However, when he reached the top of the hill, he fell on his knees and fell to the ground.
In his right hand, he holds his right hand in his right hand.
In a few seconds, the hard rock had turned into a dark green slime, and a faint scream was heard in the slime.
All of a sudden, the slime explodes, turning into a cloud of green smoke, which slowly drifts away from the road.
He is shocked to see that the stone is still in his hand, but he does not know when the green inside will disappear.
He paused for a moment, then looked back at the picture.
She looked at him.
When he returns, he sees the stone in his hand, which is a plain pebble, not even the stone itself.
"Go, go home!"
The two get into the carriage, the coachman picks up the whip and throws it away, and the two hairy dark horses slowly move about.
In the car, without saying a word, he looks at the pebbles in his hand.
"Well," she said, "it's not a bad thing, but it's not a bad thing, and I don't think it's a bad thing, and I don't think it's a bad thing, but it's a bad thing, and I don't think it's a bad thing.
The carriage goes all the way back to the house, and as it passes the town gate, Passepartout hears a shout from outside.
"I had heard that the water ghost had been removed before, and that a wanderer had come to relieve the danger of the fishing village."
"Has anyone come up to the court?"
"When I came early, I heard that even the head of Ouyang, the governor's office in the city, had almost sunk in. Fortunately, I met a man who was said to have shot a golden flash, and the ghost of water screamed, turned into green slime, and then blew up a thick smoke."
"Of course not!"
It was the first time I had ever seen a woman in the world.
He would often pass through the gates deliberately, and the officers who guarded the soldiers were well informed and liked to brag about strange things.
"It's a good thing," he said.
He remembered the jade from before, and his heart sank.
In the autumn of the 99th year of the Shōwa period, the city of Tōhoku was renamed Tōhoku.
As a result, more than half of the population of the city, including the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, the population of the city, and the population of the city.
However, not everyone seems to be aware of this, and a teenager is sleeping on a table in a school room in Qingzhou.
A young girl in a blue dress notices the scene, and her face does not show a hint of anger as she walks towards the young man who is sleeping.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, a formal student of Qingzhou College, a foreign student lecturer, beautiful face, and hot state.In the school, both eyes move with Qin Yi's moving figure, even if it is angry, Qin Yi's step is still elegant.
It was not the first time that he had ever been in such a state, and it was not the first time that he had ever been in such a state.
She looked at me, and said, "I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're going to do."
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular one, and as for the reason, as long as she can see it, she can understand that there are not many people who worship her as a goddess, and her lecture hall has always been crowded with students.
When she came to the table, she looked at the sleeping face in front of her, and her beautiful face was covered with frost.
A soft voice came out, not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind him.
In his sleep, he hears someone calling himself, and his body moves with his hands on his head, his eyes open, and his eyes dim.
It was the first time in his life that he had ever been in such a situation, and he had been in the midst of it all for a long time, and now he was in the midst of it all, and he knew that he was going to die.
"How dare he... blatantly frivolous Qin Master?"
His eyes, like those of a sword, trembled as if something was wrong, and his eyes moved upward along the seductive spot, and then he saw a delicate, jade-like but angry face.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공?."
When he looks back, he sees a 15-year-old girl looking at him in anger.
The young girl, who had been in the house for a long time, was terrified by the sight of her, and was terrified by the sight.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공'."
"Ye Futian," Qin Yi interrupted him coldly, saying, "In what context was Qingzhou Xuegong founded?"
It is clear that Qin Yi was trying to avoid the embarrassment and shift the topic, but her anger at the moment, Ye Futian can feel it clearly, he even faintly felt a string of swords flowing from Qin Yi, sharp and stinging every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, the Eastern phoenix emperor ordered all the princes of the world to build a palace of martial arts and flourished martial arts, and the Qingzhou Academy was founded in this context." Ye responded, of course, that he was talking about the official history, and that there was another name in the wild history that he saw in the family, but that taboo name was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What kind of job are you doing?."
"Training can be divided into martial arts and martial arts, and there are many professions such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, and so on, and the practitioners of martial arts have many professions such as mage, master, and master, and the masters are divided into many branches, and of course, there are also talents and endowments of martial arts and training."
"You seem to have missed a profession," Qin Yi asked solemnly.
A divine light shone upon the face of the young man: "The most powerful profession recognized in the State of God, the Companions of God, the Companions of Heaven, the Companions of Heaven, with the gifts bestowed upon them by the Heavens, those who are rarely gifted, such as the Summoners, the Collectors, and the Astrologers, the vast majority of them are of the Companions of Heaven, and the Companions of Heaven possess greater gifts than any other in their martial arts."
"Not only that, but even a Master of Destiny is naturally suited to both martial arts and martial arts."
"I didn't expect you to know much about it," said Qin Yimu, looking at the boy in front of him.
"Of course." Ye looked at Qin Yi, serious: "I am a destiny mage."
A young boy who is drinking water chokes violently, coughs violently, and a pair of eyes around him look like idiots.
Is there such a brazen person in the world as the legendary figure of Qingzhou Academy, who not only openly molested Qin's sister, but now falsely claims to be a mage of destiny, in order to attract the attention of Qin's sister?
But who is he, who has been in the Academy for three years, who has been awakening to the first realms of concentration, who has been stagnant, who is weak, who is apparently unfinished, who is so mediocre and even wasteful that he claims to be a doer of destiny?
She looked at him, and said, "If you are a woman, you are a man, and you are a woman, and you are a man, and you are a woman, and you are a man."
"My soul is still asleep, I cannot call it out, and I sleep in the lecture hall because of my soul."
"When I was twelve years old, when I was still a student of the outside world, I visited you to test your talent, and you were aware of the spirit as a heavenly quality, shocked at the palace, many teachers paid attention to it, but after three years, there was no intrusion, and always remained in the first reunion of awakening, doing nothing all the time, lazy, in the lecture hall, did you practice?"
"For the past three years, whether in the spring or the fall, you have abstained from all the exams, and have you ever been ashamed of yourself?"
With Qin Yi's angry roar, the whole school became silent and audible, and the eyes of the people gazed at Qin Yi's agitated face, as if this was the first time they had seen Qin's sister.
He also appears to have been taken aback, with his dark eyes staring at the delicate red face in front of him.
He had been in the army for three years, and he had been in the army for a long time, but he had never been in the army, and he had never been in the army, nor had he been in the army, nor had he been in the army.
There is a silence in the space, Qin Yimei eyes staring at the young man in front of her, a handsome face with clear lines, a clean deep eyes, a brilliant star, a 15-year-old age, in addition to being thin, it is impossible to pick out other problems, and after two or three years, it will be a beautiful man.
"Is my tone too heavy?" said Qin Yi, who seemed to have a sense of desolation in his eyes, and could not help but feel that his anger had dissipated.
"If you don't want to go back to school," he said, "and if you don't want to go back to school, you don't want to go back to school."
If this is the case, it will be recorded in the history of the Qingzhou Academy, and it is rare that it can be expelled from the Qingzhou Academy.
"He is going, I am going." At the end, a soft voice came, and many looked at the boy sitting in the corner, with complex eyes, envy, jealousy, adoration, and fear.
"It has been decided in the palace that the rest of his life will not be required to participate in the spring of the next year, and that he will be free to choose the palace, the Knights, and any palace of the Palace of Arts to practice, and that his future will no longer be burdened by you."
There was a slight smile on his face, which was somewhat cynical.
"Sit down..." and stand up for the rest of his life, his eyes shining with a brilliant light, piercing Qin Yi.
And then he sat down in silence, as if the words of the leaves had been irresistible to him, for the rest of his life, his eyes still fixed on the back of his head.
"I have decided..." Ye Futian with a slight smile on his face, looking at Qin Yidao: "I will officially participate in the university entrance examination this autumn."
There is a bright light in the back of his eyes.
Three years later, is he serious?
For the next three or four years, the school was known to be a good school, a good school, a good school, a good school, a good school, a good school, a good school, and a good school.
But who really knows the sleeping teenager?
"You are weak, you are still in the state of awakening first reunion, even if you participate in the autumn examination, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, even if it is still late to rise up.
"What if I don't know?" he asked, with a confident voice.
"If you can do it, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall later."
"What do you want me to do?" he asked, looking at his face, "I want to do what I want to do."
"This guy, what do you mean..."
"Where are you looking, you shameless bastard?" It seems to notice the eyes of Ye Futian, many people have the impulse to run away, he even dare to flirt with Qin Shijie?
"What do you want me to do?" he asked, with a smile, "I want you to do what you want me to do."
The mountains are dark, and the mountains are dark.
For the first time, all nations appeared at the same time, putting aside their grudges, and the tiger, the rabbit, the fox, and the snake... all kinds of demons came together. For a time the whole forest was full of all kinds of demons, big or small, tender or seductive voices, and at the top were the ten demon kings, the ten most powerful of the demons, and the same heavy expression appeared between the eyebrows.
The tiger family has always been strong, and the first thing the king of the tiger said was to silence the demons. "We belong to the same class of demons, and in such a crisis, I feel that all nations should put aside their prejudices and join forces to solve the problems at hand."
"For what purpose?"
"Is this a guess?" the tiger exclaimed, "Who would do it but the monks of the six sects and the three sects, and how few of us have been slain by him all these years?"
"But we have always been clearly separated from these Shu Xianmen, and why they have suddenly blocked my way out of the border."
"And they didn't eat the first of their three or six," the Serpent King speculated. "They don't have to tear their faces like this?"
"That's it!" the king of the leopard was indignant, "This has been the way it has been for many years.
"Yes, we all know that the enchantment of our world has done them a disservice, so that they have never been near the border forest, and how they have been able to stay here."
"But... except for three of the six factions, who has the strength to kill all the demons who have gone out of the border in three months."
The eagle nodded, as if recalling what he had seen, and his feathers trembled, "I have heard that the beasts that have come out of the earth, every one of them dead, every one of them dead, and every one of them pounded, every one of them dead, every one of them dead, and every one of them dead, and every one of them dead.
"It's too much of a deception." The Tiger King smashed the armrest of the stone chair in his hand, and stood up angrily. "Demon kings, I think it would be better to kill them together than to guess who's doing it. I don't believe it.
When he did so, the other nine kings showed signs of approval, and instead of being frightened, he was more willing to take action.
The Deer King replied, "My son is dead in their hands, and it would be better to go out and kill him rather than guessing here.
"Didn't we gather here today for this? Whoever he is, kill him to avenge the death of his kind." Even the least-daring Rabbit King stood up in response, and the Rabbits were the ones who died the most.
"Yes, it is," he said.
"The spirit of the people is upon me, and I swear to avenge it."
In addition to this, there are many other groups of people who have also come to the aid of the Lord of the Rings, who have also come to the aid of the Lord of the Rings, and who have come to the aid of the Lord of the Rings.
"I don't think I have to go."
In the midst of the wave of fury, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared, a quiet but successful one, which caught the attention of the demons, and as soon as the shout ceased, the sight of all the demons sprang to life.
"Who is it?" says the Tiger King, who is searching for a mysterious creature.
He is the only one of the five to have survived, though he is not the only one to have survived.
"Who is the one who has just spoken?" exclaimed the Tiger King, "Where is the counselor?
"I'm here, I'm here!"
Once again, the demons look around and see who is still speaking.
"Here, here...," the voice repeated, "Left, left, no... past, right, wrong, look here, look here!"
Many of the people who came to see the show did not know what to do.
"Oh, come on, I'm here!"
Until, with a sigh, a figure suddenly clasped its hands and feet, climbed up the high platform on which the kings of the demons were sitting, and the demons saw the voice of the man.
It was a woman in a grey robe who could not sit on her shoulders, and her eyes were sloppy and sloppy, and her face was a little yellow.
The word "weak" comes to mind at the same time, and it is too weak! Even the spirit of the demon is so weak that it seems as if it could blow her away.
It is no wonder that the demons have not been able to find this man for a long time, and such a demon is so unremarkable.
"Well," he said, "you are a little boy, and a few monks have frightened you and made you look like this." All the demons can be transformed, but it is a demon assembly, so most of the demons here have exposed some archetypes to distinguish races, and only she keeps a complete human form, which makes the tiger king even more disagreeable. "I am a man."
"I am a man," answered the woman.
"Shemale?" the Tiger King paused, "What kind of a shemale is that?
"What a mess of little monsters dare to come to the fair." The Tiger King glanced at the girl indignantly and said, "You unseeded little devil, Hugh, you're talking nonsense here, and it affects our morale to wait for revenge."
"No, I'm serious." The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders sagging even more weakly. "You really don't need to go out and seek revenge."
"It's still discouraging!" cried the Tiger King, angrily, "Believe me or not, I ate you a ladyboy."
"You eat me, and you don't have to run?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, the one you just talked about who killed the monster, the beast..." She sighed, patted the gown on the back of her head, still lethargic, but pointed to her nose and said, "Maybe it's me!"
The entire scene was silent for three seconds.
"Kill her!"
The demon then attacks the girl and kills her.
Small animals - what a trouble!
Five minutes later.
The first and last round of the tournament is over!
Chapter 1: Tony & # 183; Donne?
A loud noise stimulates the brain & apos; s nerves, a loud decibel can cause deafness, a blinding white light shines into the eyes, and the sun * * causes pain.
The white light did not fade, but spread to the whole world.
What's going on with that motherfucker? Will I be there on the rock?
Dawne opened his eyes, cursing in his heart, and rushed into his eyes with a large, terrifying face, a face covered in sweaty black, the heat of the two black holes beneath the broad nose seemed to have seeped into his face, the white teeth in the cracked mouths as frightening as wild animals, and, of course, the bad breath coming out of it.
Then there was a violent, frontal clash, in which Downe felt as if he had been struck in the jaw with a heavy punch, and the man fell backwards.
The weight of the two men was on the poor plastic bottles, and they broke down; the water spilled out of the white flowers, and even a water column sprang out of a bottle, and sprang directly into the face of the "pool fish" behind them, the other "pool fish" surging up like frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!"
"Oh, my God!"
"What's going on?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick?"
Downe lay on the ground, staring at the strange faces that surrounded him, some anxious, some gloating, some covering their faces without expression, all still noisy, but just now the great noise had changed the tone, and there was booing and laughter.
Where is this, who are they and what is going on?
Wait, let's see what happens on the pitch? "The commentator on the live broadcast suddenly became excited, and he got up and looked down from the penthouse," David & # 183; the foreman of the Forest, david Johnson, was knocked into the sidelines in a scuffle with the other player, poor Tony & # 183; Coach Downe was standing on the sidelines conducting the match...
Downe lay on the ground, his light gray suit wet and wrinkled with grass and dirt, looking like a freshly used rag.
A man with a black beard with a big nose and a somewhat moriar-like appearance appears in his field of vision, and he pulls out a white glove from his backpack and puts it on, and begins to examine Donne's body.
See the ghost, he looks like the back of his head!
"Can you hear me?" he held out his hand and waved in front of Donne in a tone that was visibly more impatient than before.
At the same time, I felt the same way.
David & # 183; Johansson was pushed hard by the opposing team in a fierce fight with the opposing team on the 14th, and then the large, black body slanted towards Tony & # 183; Downe, who was standing at the edge of the field, but who had been able to avoid it and had had enough time, stood there like a puppet and watched his teammates run into him.
With the Forest players anxiously encircling the coach's seat, the center of the crowd is naturally Donne lying on the ground, with the blameless black striker David & # 183; Johnson kneeling on the ground and praying, and if his coach had been short, he would have been the first to kill his coach on the pitch.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents were standing on the field with their arms around them, and there were curious people who took on the role of spies for the entire team, running to see the crowds and then running back to share what was happening in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands did not seem to be worried about their coach's death, and they took the opportunity to yell at their team's poor performance, with words beginning with "F" or "s" coming out of their mouths, and countless high-pitched middle fingers making the "0: 2" on the big screen stand out.
The Forest team doctor, Gary F1eming, was still doing his part, but he had just seen Tony's eyes move, so why didn't he react?
The team's acting head coach was lying on the ground like wax, with his mouth wide open and his eyes twinkling, as if he had seen something startling.
The blue canopy, the marshmallow white clouds, the faces of people with different skin tones and expressions, the noisy environment, all this is familiar, but strange, as if it were a distance away from you.
The referee ruled that the team doctor had to take care of it himself, and that he could not let an injury off the field stop the game endlessly. He whistled to the players back on the field, and the game would continue, even though the Forest players had lost interest in the game.
"But he may even be in danger of death!" Fleming, angered by the referee's indifference, yelled at the referee as he lay still on the ground.
"Then call an ambulance, I'm just a referee!" The referee went back, "and he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you say." He pointed to Fleming and ran back to the field.
Fleming turned back to see Donne stand up, slowly swallowing the back of his head. "How do you feel, Tony?"
"Where is this?"
Fleming turned around and scolded a dirty word, which had been a bad thing these days: "Dess, Dess, come on!" He beckoned a gold man to the coach's seat.
The man called "Ders" ran up to him. "How about Tony?"
"It's awful. He even asked me where I was."
Desmond's reaction was the same as Fleming's, and he cursed.
"I suspect he just fell to the ground, and the back of his head was struck."
"Is it bad, Gary?"
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad," Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"The good thing is that he has only temporary amnesia, and after a break he comes back. The bad thing is... do you need me to tell him?"
Dess waved and signaled to him that he understood: "Will you send him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we're behind, and we need him to direct the game..." He turned his head and looked at Tony & # 183; Donne next to him, but he was surprised that Donne was slowly moving towards the player.
"Hey!" Doss hurriedly throws Fleming out and runs up and grabs his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going?"
Dawne looked back at Dess with a dazed look, and now they had a golden sunset on their heads, but he could not see any gleam in those eyes.
"Tony, where are you going?"
"I... I don't know, maybe... I'm coming home..."
Fleming ran from one side: "Tony, you can't go home now, we're in the game, you're the head coach, you're in charge of the team!"
The trio's pull at the concourse drew the attention of the two teams' bench, and even the players on the pitch sometimes glanced at them.
How could I be a coach?... Although I'm a fan and play football manager games a lot, how could I be a coach?
As Fleming put it next to the two who first met, "He's Ders, Ders & # 183; desa1ker, a former England international who played as a midfielder and retired from the team last season, now your colleague and your assistant."
Donne nodded, and then said to Dess, "Okay, now you're running the game for me, and I'm going to take a rest." With that, he took Dess's hand and walked into the aisle, ignoring the huge boos and the two stunned men behind him.
Fleming looked at Donne's back and then at Debs & # 183; Walker.
With a sigh, Walker turned and walked back. "The game is over!"
Sitting in the passageway, with his back to the wall, Donne gazes at the surrounding environment; on the white wall opposite him is a huge sign, and under the large red "mushroom" are three wavy curves, followed by the English word "Forest."
Where am I, and what is going on?
Don touches his back of the head, where there is a faint pain.
* * *, Attack Lao Tse, Behind Lao Tse!
"What am I to call?" he murmured, and then he suddenly stopped his mouth.Only then did he realize that all he had been saying was birds--English.
& quot; * * *, how did this happen? & quot;
When he finally finds out where he is, he stays again, which is so bizarre that his brain stops responding after a load run, and it seems as if it has nothing to do with him anymore.
That's what happened this afternoon at the City Stadium, where Forest's acting head coach Tony & # 183; Downe stood on the sidelines and was knocked over by his teammates, then seemed to fall into a brief coma, and when he got back up, he walked straight into the players "hallway.
Through the faint light of the street lamps outside, Donne stands in the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror, a middle-aged bastard with a tall bridge of nose, deep eyes, blue eyes, and a brown curvy head.
In fact, Tang is only twenty-six years old from Sichuan, China, and all the people in the mirror have raised their heads!
Not only did he succumb inexplicably to an Englishman, but he went on for four years and three months!
Although he never seemed to be very handsome, he was able to attract many women.
He snarled at the mirror, then smashed it with a punch, and in the mirror he was transformed into a multitude of himself, the fragments of which fell to the ground with a rustling sound, and the faces of which looked at Donne as if they were mocking him.
Donne felt a little dizzy, and he took a step back and leaned against the smooth wall, gasping for air.
After a few minutes of quiet in the dark, Dawne gradually calms down, deciding not to think about such complex issues. He has a habit in China of drinking in places where he finds things that don't suit him. Chengdu is full of bars, and he might even be able to find a night out.
Looking out at the haze of the outside sky, he walks out the door in a thick trench coat.
"Having lost 3 of his own home games to the underdog Wollsall, the Forest have been in a really bad game lately. The hoped-for Paul & # 183; Hart, who submitted his resignation to the club's president, Nigel & # 183; nige1 doughty, after the last round, was quickly approved."
Today's sports news is broadcast on a television set mounted on an elevated platform, with a natural focus on everything that happens around Nottingham Forest games.
There was a knock at the door.
A drunken bastard raised his middle finger to the television set. "That Tony & # 183; Downe I know him! The little hairy boy who once served as Paul & # 183; Hart's assistant in the youth team."
Just as the drunkard had finished his long talk, Donne pushed in, and the door rattled to the attention of most of the people in the bar who were drinking and chatting, all looking at the door, first surprised to see who was coming in, and then with a teasing smile on their faces.
A typical English middle-aged man stood up with a glass in his hand and shouted, "Our Tony Tang coach is here!"
"'한끼줍쇼' 박진영 X 한끼성공 (종합)."
"For the sake of his beauty to hold Johanson's break out of the field!" The middle-aged man raised his glass, and those around him immediately raised their glasses.
Another apparently drunken man got up and walked up to Downe, with a beer bottle in his hand, and burped him, saying, "Tony & # 183; Coach Downe, that was a nice defense, but obviously neither the referee nor public opinion... thought so...
He turned his head to look at her.
Then he went straight to the bar, and said to the bartender, "Bring me the bottle..." He habitually thought of the bottle as a "little two" - a small two pot, though he was from the north of Sichuan, but he liked it from that time on - but he now does not speak "little two" English, and more importantly, he quickly reacted to it in England, not China.
The others, who had been watching him, had heard him say that he wanted the strongest wine, and had begun to laugh loudly.
"Do you drink too?."
The young bartender, overwhelmed by the exuberant guests, wanted to get some wine, but was stopped by the drunkards: "Get him some juice!
"No, no, milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ha ha ha!"
The owner of the bar, alarmed by the noise outside, descended from the upper floor and stood at the entrance of the stairs, where he saw almost all the guests who had not yet fallen asleep on the table, surrounded by the bar, sitting among them a man in a black trench coat, mocked by the drunkards.
His loud voice silenced the tavern, and the drunkards, who had been so loud, became silent when they saw the people standing behind them.
Donne wondered who could have brought the group down with a single word; he turned his head slightly and saw a man emerge from the shadows of the stairwell.
The young bartender hurriedly pointed to Don and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a bottle of spirits."
When the visitor saw who was sitting, he was somewhat surprised, but he said, "It's for him."
"But... but they don't let..." the bartender looked at the drinkers who had returned to their seats.
The man glanced around the bar, but those who were swept away by his gaze would bow their heads, either to sleep or to drink heavily with their heads bowed, and Donne became more interested in the skilled middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see no one objecting, pour him a glass of Scotch whisky, and I'll invite him," the barman asked, turning to Donne. "Single or double?"
There was a knock at the door.
The barman smiled. "I forgot who you are..." He poured half a glass of golden whiskey, added half a glass of water, and handed it to Donne: "This is the wine of my hometown."
Donne drank a sip, coughed up, and rarely drank a glass of foreign wine, not to mention the strong taste of the pure Scotch whisky.
There was a knock at the door.
"I know Tony & # 183; Donne never drank, he was like a real traditional Puritan, and he doesn't look at me like he does now, don't you know who I am?"
He had to find a way to disguise himself. "Well... I," said Downe, bowing his head and taking another sip; this time he did not dare to let the liquor stay in his throat for another second, swallowing it directly, and the discomfort was lightened.
There was a knock at the door.
The man touches the back of his head to show understanding.
The person sitting next to you is the pride of the Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Cup winner, 1978 Stanley & # 183; Matthews Award winner Kenny & # 183; Mr. KennyBurns!
The man behind him laughs, screams, and throws the last half of the glass of Scotch whisky in his hand. The golden Scotch shines brightly in the light, draws a beautiful arc in the air, and then hits the pompous face with precision - like David & # 183; Beckham's right foot free kick. "Bang!"
His swearing was smashed back by a thick glass of wine, and Donne threw it on the other side with an unthinkable swiftness; he could not bear it any longer, somehow came to the place, somehow walked forward for four and a half years, inexplicably ridiculed and insulted... now he wants to find a man, whether he knocks him down or someone knocks him down.
The two hit the table behind them, and the empty bottle fell, breaking the ground in a crackling sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone was stunned; they did not expect to be as cowardly as Tony & # 183; Donne.
The first to respond was pub owner Kenny & # 183; Burns, who pushed a fat man standing by the bar and shouted, "What are you standing for?
In addition to the misery on the ground and the blood oozing from his forehead, where a red circle, the mark of the mouth of the cup, appeared, he received a blow on his left cheek, as if drunk.
Downe, on the other hand, had done nothing but mess up his head and clothes, and when he was pulled up, it seemed as if he had finished his fury and had no need for a fight, he tidied up his clothes and head, and spelt out to the hapless fellow: "I don't care who you are, I don't care who you are."
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry, I messed up you here, too * * * today..." He was annoyed at the thought that he had been crossed, "Another day... I will come and apologize myself, and don't worry about compensation."
Then, without waiting for the barman to say anything, he turned and walked to the door, and as he passed by the fat man, he mocked, "Leave your milk for yourself, fat pig."
When they see him, they don't want to stop him, so they leave him alone.
There was silence in the bar, when the drunken drunkard sat up from the table and, looking at the silent room and the lull, asked, "What have I missed?"
Let me go back, let me go back, let me go back!
Since his "past life" is quite bad, why not take this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, he has watched football for more than a decade, has played football manager games every generation, and knows a little about the nature of the work of some coaches, isn't it a good opportunity to challenge?
Instead of thinking about why God chose him, he now has to think about how to act more like a real professional coach, which would be difficult but worth trying.
"Hey, dude, you broke into my house without my permission, and I'm going to call the police if you don't leave me!"
Donne looked at the old man standing opposite, holding a half-bitten hamburger in his arms, with many newspapers in his arms.
"Is This... Your Home?" refers to the bench below him.
"Of course."
"Ah, I'm sorry to disturb you..." Donne gets up from his chair, and the man immediately * * sits down and lies down, covering himself with the newspapers in his arms and pressing them firmly between the back of the chair and his body.
Watching the contented beggar eating the hamburger and lying in the "den of newspapers," Donne even thanked God for not allowing himself to be "possessed" by him.
A cab drops in front of him, and he steps forward and crawls in, only to see a beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying a "dinner" for the last time, before the driver takes him back to his strange home.
Starting today, a whole new world begins to unfold before Dowen's eyes: on Saturday morning, when the wind blows, Zhao Yao is walking on his way to sterilization... on his way to sterilization of his cat.
In the bag on his hand is a yellowish-orange cat, also known as an orange cat, a type of pastoral cat, whose head, back, and limbs are covered with layers of yellow-orange markings.
The chest and stomach are covered with large white hairs, and the tips of the limbs are white, which are said to have a killing effect on girls by controlling their brain waves and causing them to make a "Ah ~ ~ ~ ~" sound.
Although he is a cat, his eyes are large and he looks very cute.
At this point, the cat is howling with tears in its eyes. The vast majority of domestic cats are very, very large, willing to stay at home for the rest of their lives, and moving or going out is a terrible thing for them.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dim meteor passes slowly through outer space and flies over China, shimmering with a strange luster on the surface of the meteor, which seems to be emitting some kind of ray into the surrounding void.
At the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao placed the bag at the front desk: "Male cat sterilized, booked before, surnamed Zhao."
"You didn't come to us before you looked at the record, and you were asked to fill in the medical card information box."
In outer space, the meteor slowly crosses the Chinese land, and begins to move in the direction of the Pacific Ocean, where the meteor passes, many cats suddenly shake their bodies, shimmering in the deep gloss of their eyes, just as the meteor shines.
At the same time, he was struggling to get out of the hospital and running to the hospital.
The little girl, who had been waiting for her, ran out of the room and grabbed a cup of tea.
Zhao Yao was still too slow to grab the body of the tea, only to grab the tail of the tea.
It is said that when he was about to leave, he turned his back to Zhao Yao, and suddenly a mouth was opened on the back of Zhao Yao's hand, and Zhao Yao's hand hurt, and he immediately loosened his hand.
Perhaps it was because he knew that he had done something wrong, but he did not continue to run away, only curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some uneasiness.
Zhao Yao clutched the matter-of-factly: "Silly cat, what do you bite, rebel!"
The cat's eyes suddenly glowed with a faint light, and the silky blood stains on her teeth disappeared completely.
He also felt a sudden fainting of the head, and then he wanted to look at the wound on the back of his hand, but it was only a slight look, and he saw a smooth area on the back of his hand, where there was a wound and blood.
"Well, it's all right," said the little nurse, "it's all right, and it's all right.
It is not a simple catchphrase, but rather an intelligible word.
Zhao Yao pointed to the matcha tea in front of him and said, "This... this... this cat is talking!"
The nurse looked at Zhao and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you all right?"
"Don't you hear it?" said Zhao, "it... it's talking."
The young nurse frowns and looks at Zhao Yao with increasingly strange eyes.
"Do you understand me?"
"Take me home!"
"Oh, I'm so scared."
Zhao, with his mouth wide open, looked at the little nurse who was still comforting him, and said, "Can you understand me?"
"I can understand, I can understand, I'm going home, take me home, whoosh whoosh whoosh."
The nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more strange.
Despite the nurse's strange look, Zhao Yao quickly picked up matcha tea and put it back in the bag, and ran away from the hospital.
In the rented room, the cat immediately relaxes in its familiar surroundings, lays on a coffee table and begins to lick its little white hand, its eyes squinting and its face relaxed.
Before the coffee table, Zhao Yao was staring at the matcha cat in front of him, testing, "Can you still talk?"
Then he stood up and leapt to his feet and asked, "Do you want to play?"
"Eh, this is... wait and play." Zhao Yao grabbed the back of his head and said, "When did you learn to talk?"
Looking at a cat with an innocent face, Zhao Yao has a strange face.
The cat jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted at him, and said, "Play a game with me."
Looking at the cat talking like a five-year-old child, Zhao touches the other's head, revealing a purring of enjoyment.
"You are only a year old, and now you are only five years old," Zhao Yao said with a smile on his lips. "Still a child, it seems good."
A month later, at 9: 00 p.m.
Zhao Yao opened the rental house door with a tired face, took off his clothes with his hands, and sat down on the sofa.
The house he lived in was only 30 square meters, but it was renovated completely, it was a former house of a married couple, and it was close to the company so that he could work overtime every day without worrying about traffic problems, so the rent was not cheap, but it was still willing to make Zhao Yao.
As he lay down, the cat crawled up to him and rubbed his head against his arm, looking affectionate and flattering.
He smiled and rubbed the head of the matcha tea, the latter showing an expression of enjoyment.
At the same time, the cell phone on the sofa was also pushed by the tea.
Chapter 1
In the middle of the room, a young man with a black beard and a long, black beard is sitting on the edge of the table, with his head resting on the edge of the table.
What's going on?
She has a crush on her husband, who has a crush on her, and she has a crush on him, but she has a crush on him, and he has a crush on her, and she has a crush on him.
She is the younger sister of her mother.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
He was a good man, and a good man, and a good man.
What to do?
He looked at the man, as if he had caught a straw, and said, "Sir, save me, I have been drugged, and the men behind me are trying to force me."
The man's dark, cold eyes looked over the girl at the men behind him, their eyes dim, but shuddering.
The men were a little clumsy, had seen the world, and this man, who covered the headlines of financial magazines and controlled the economic life of the empire, had seen them on television.
Cold Chill.
The man could not be offended, so they turned and ran, and in a place completely covered by darkness, there was an earth-shattering battle going on, between an angel with flaming wings, a knight with heavy armour, a crusader with a golden sword, and an evil army of dragons covered in black smoke, ferocious and terrifying knights of death, and countless skeletons.
It is a strange imagination that the battlefields of the two sides are not somewhere in a plain of war and smoke, or in a burial ground full of bones, but in a dark, unseen darkness.
But what is more bizarre is that outside this battlefield, in the void enveloped in endless darkness, a few faint voices can be heard whispering?
"Take it, take it, take it, my God!"
"Take control of your Knights of Death when you speak of others! The Knights of Death and the mobile blockhouses are up!"
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where are the enemies?"
After the end of the battle, the angels, knights, and scattered skeletons disappeared into the darkness of the background, returning to a state of absolute silence enveloped in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.
But several voices are still talking, and even more are joining in.
"My teammates are just a bunch of pigs! The tie dogs are better than them! Not only do they have a little help in the battle, but they also take command of the core troops..."
Another voice countered unabashedly, and forcefully justified his misdirection by saying: "I thought the Knights of Death could easily get rid of the blockhouses."
When I heard this, I could not help but smile a few times in the dark, and the two sides of the argument suddenly lost their temper, and said, helplessly, to the victorious side, "I am not as skilled as a man, and I will take the wind down."
And did the victor make a mockery of it?
"Ha ha! Good will prevail against evil!"
"In the face of our power, God will kill you, whether it be a ghost or a demon!"
This is no doubt even more so, as the two sides, already at peace, begin a new round of bickering, and a third man, who has moved away from the new battlefield, asks, "Shouldn't I organize this round?"
Was it just a game before that terrible and fierce war?
A voice that was not involved in the game responded, "It's amazing to be able to use our minds to simulate a realistic war, to make us bystanders feel like we're there, and you're really good at surprising us, I hope, sir."
And the guy called Hope, in the face of the sudden thanks, replied quietly: "You've won the prize, it's just a distraction."
Yes, that great battle, like a battle between the forces of good and evil, is a mere pastime that can only add a little fun to this endless prison.
It is a realm of emptiness beyond the realms of reality, a realm of eternal darkness, cold, and silence, a realm where no living being survives, a realm more terrible than death.
However, it is in such a place that it is impossible to accommodate the death of any creature, but the stubborn existence of a group of creatures who have lost their bodies, and only the last consciousness remains in this void.
They call themselves the Void, and are imprisoned forever in a prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the most powerful of all races in all fields, the magician who ascended to the top of the magic path, the warrior who touched the limit of the martial path, the alchemist who created all things, the righteous preacher, the demon who ruled hell, the lich who controlled the soul, and so on.
Many people think that they have long since died, and only the historical records show that they have existed, but they do not know that these old monsters, who are strong enough to be described as perverted, have been confined in the endless void outside the plane, have lived there for countless years, and seem to be imprisoned forever, and the seemingly thin barrier between reality and emptiness is a wall of sighing that they can never break through, and the power they once had is so powerful that they can not do anything about it.
However, they never gave up hope of escaping, because there is a very special existence among the 33 Void Ones, which is the fifth Void Ones.
I hope that the original name Bai also comes not from the size of the human existence outside the void, but from a strange place called the earth, where he was the editor of a small news website, and his daily job is to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then change it to something like a surprise!
Titles such as "Men will shed tears" and "Women will be silent" were re-posted on their website, a tedious and tedious job.
In the end, he was unable to find a way to escape, but instead, he found himself in the midst of a series of mysterious events that had taken place in the past, such as the death of one of his friends and the death of another.
The Voiders insisted that he from a different world would be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "You are the only one who is different and wants to get out of here, you are our only chance, and I firmly believe that, so I call you by this code of hope."
They have always believed in this, believing that they will one day be able to see the sun again, even if they have been imprisoned for countless hours, hundreds or thousands of years?
To stay in this immutable prison for thousands of years without going insane, it is clearly not enough just to talk or discuss, in fact the main means of leisure time for the Void is an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on a conscious technique called memory backtracking, which allows one to recall every detail of one's experience, even every punctuation in a newspaper.
Then, through a certain amount of editing, some of the memories that others do not want to see, such as going to bed with a woman or sleeping with a right or left hand, and then exchanging memories with each other, it is said to be a very long movie about the life of another person, which is a great way to kill time.
The memory of the Thirty-Three Voiders is the same as that of the Thirty-Three Voiders, and even though he later forgets most of his memories to avoid confusion and only preserves his knowledge and experience, his mind has been sifted away from the weaknesses of the Thirty-Three Voiders, and he has become mature and calm, no longer a normal person on Earth.
It is not surprising that he was able to find a way out of this situation, but he was able to find a way out of it, and the only way he was able to do it was to make it a little bit less boring.
At the same time, the reality of Ester is about to usher in the night, and when the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire campus, the students end the day with heavy work, accompanied by young and cheerful laughter, walking along a path of trees in the college.
In the second season of the show, she is seen wearing a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, and a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, a pair of black shorts, and a pair of black shorts.
A few minutes later, the sound of a winged fan was heard in the air, and several white pigeons quickly fell to the foot of Miya, pecking at the crumbs she had spilled, and making a cooing sound, Miya carefully squatted down, and the long horse-tail gently swept to the ground with her movements, and she quietly looked at the pigeons she had already known, with a comforting smile on her face.
A beautiful young girl, a docile white dove, stands quietly in a square with several statues, and with the surrounding lush vegetation, under the last golden afterglow of the sunset, they all converge into a beautiful picture.
This is one of the most difficult times in the school's history, as it is one of the most difficult times in the school's history.
"It's getting dark, come here today, I have to go back to practice, see you again, gentlemen pigeons," said Miya, with a lighthearted smile on her face, bidding farewell to the flocks of pigeons.
The evening is also an important time for studying, especially for a gifted student such as Miya, who does not have to work as hard as a smile on her face.
1. Chapter 1
In the center of the building, a large ceremony is being held.
He is the son of an old man, and the son of an old man, and the son of an old man.
He was the son of Suhong, the head of the Suo family, and at the age of 14, he completed a nine-piece hardening process, which is known as the first day of the Suo family.
There is no such thing as a supernatural being, and the only thing that can be said about him is that he is not a supernatural being, and that he is not a supernatural being.
In addition to the five main characters, the two main characters can also be seen in the film, and the two main characters can also be seen in the film, as well as in the manga.
As the name suggests, it is the name given to a group of young men who, when they were young, looked at each other, looked at each other, looked at each other, looked at each other, looked at each other, and then at each other.
Sue is calm and rises to the top of the altar.
Sue, who has stepped down from the altar, looks at Sumo with a cold smile on her face and her eyes are full of provocation.
Sumo took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes.
From the bottom of the altar, a beam of light floats out, constantly diving into Sumo's body.
His talent was at the top of his class in the Suu family, and he was quenched at the age of 15, but he was always overpowered by Sumo.
By this time, more and more runes were flashing on the altar, wrapping up Sumo's body.
Sumo, sitting with his eyes closed, breathed a little bit, and a roar began to ring from his body.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar!
Boom!
At the end of the film, a dark shadow rises up like a black hole, slowly spinning inside, giving a feeling of cold.
At the same time, a yellow halo flashes above the shadow.
Ah!
For a moment, all eyes were dull.
A Halo?
The Lowest Armor?
How is that possible?
Even Su Yu was stunned and stunned.
For he did not think that the first day of the Sui family had awakened only the military spirit of the first rank of the human class, the lowest military spirit!
Sitting on the altar, he slowly opened his eyes and saw his own soul.
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 아이돌아온다!."
"The Most Awakening: The Most Awakening."
"What is the matter with you?" he asked.
For a time, including Suu's parents, deacons, and others, all looked at Sumo with disdain, disdain, and contempt.
On the altar, Sumo slowly rises and unconsciously clenches his fists.
As he glanced around, Sumo snickered: "These people are snobbish enough!"
In the past, Sumo was very talented, and everyone was kind to him, and he was always behind in front of everyone, and there was a crackling sound of his ass.
Now that he has awakened the Junk Spirit, these people immediately change their faces.
Sue shook her head and walked away from the altar.
The face is fleshy and appears to be surrounded by grass.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I survive?"
He was somewhat surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped, the sight of his eyes glaring at him with an instant of agitation.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
He looked at her for a moment, and then he saw that she was looking at him, and he saw that she was looking at him, and he saw that she was looking at him, and he saw that she was looking at him.
"Girl, what are you doing, you can't urinate and defecate!"
She screamed, panicked, lowered her dress, and the whole of the miso bounced from the spot and flew away with a sharp sword.
What is this? The Sword in the Sky?
Is it a fairy?
At the same time, a strange and familiar memory pops up in his head, as if he had been born with it.
My Mother Goes Through!
The memory of what happened in his mind was lost, and he lost everything.
It is a kind of magic that can be used as a weapon against evil spirits, as well as a weapon against evil spirits that can be used against evil spirits.
The owner of the house is the current owner of the house, but the owner of the house is the owner of the house.
He is a poor orphan himself, but has a unique spiritual root that is rarely seen for a thousand years.
When he was a child, he was recruited as a prince by the emperor, and provided a number of celestial treasures for his cultivation, and in a short period of six years, he froze in his belly and stepped into the golden age.
When he arrived at the palace, he found himself in a cave with the princess, and spent seven days and seven nights in a marriage bed; as a result, the beautiful princess was so beautiful that she had to repair her body, and even her spiritual talent was taken away.
In the end, he was forced to leave the palace and was sent to the frontier, where he was beaten to death by the hands of the emperor, and his body was finally dumped.
"Alas, alas!"
"Damn it! Why didn't you take a step forward and cross over to the happy time when you were in bed doing the crazy exercise with the beautiful princess?"
It is a pity to think of the beauty of the princess who has lost her soul in the marriage bed, and the pride of her life, and the respite of her temperament.
"Bold thief, dare to peep at the girl in the toilet, give me life!"
At this point, a scream is heard, and it is the fairy who returns.
Her face was red with indignation, and her eyes were full of unending intent to kill, and she stepped on the cold, sharp sword at her feet.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The woman's face suddenly changed, and with a red face, she raised her trousers under her skirt, and said, with a pat, "The thief is looking for death." The sword flew at a rapid speed at the foot, and swung at Xu.
In the middle of the night, she runs into a crazy man who is trying to escape.
Suddenly, there was a flash of light in his head.
As soon as he stopped, he drew a familiar token out of his arms, turned around, and shouted at the woman, "Bold witch, I am the prince of today's Fire Kingdom, do you dare not respect me?
At the same time, there was a sudden ringing in his ears.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Fu' for activating the face-punching system, which will escort you and help you fly!"
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "for the success, reward for the value of 1, will you enter the mall to redeem?"
"The system detects that the host's ability to survive in the world's difficulty is low, and rewards the novice with a large package, do you check the package?"
At the same time as the beep, a light curtain window pops up showing several pieces of information.
It was the first time in my life that I had been able to do this, and it was the first time in my life that I was able to do this, and it was the first time in my life that I was able to do this.
"The thief, what are you laughing at?"
Suddenly, a shout pulls Xu from his ecstasy.
The woman was standing ten meters in front of him, holding a sword in her hand and pointing it at him.
"Come on... would you like to do something with me?
"Tin, congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "to pretend to succeed, reward for the value of 1."
Of course, Xu's ear rang again for a system that only he could hear, and he could not help laughing again. "Yes, as if there was a package."
At the end of the video, a small box is opened, and a small box is opened.
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "to get the first experience Dan, take the 10,000 test."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Fu' to get two cards of the first level of the divine escape, and after use can be instantly moved to any place beyond five kilometers square."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Wen' for obtaining the first stage of the 'Taikoo Five Elements' (Note: the first stage can only be cultivated until the foundation period, and later can be exchanged in the mall)."
"Chin, if you detect that the host's spiritual root is defective and does not meet the conditions for cultivation, the system will fill all the spiritual roots for you."
At the same time, he felt as if his body were being penetrated by an electric current, and his scalp was instantly flared.
This is followed by a feeling of relief, as the pores of the body are completely opened and greedy to draw in the four-way aura.
Boom!
Soon, he feels that his body has changed dramatically, becoming closer to nature, as if he were able to blend into everything and control everything.
But he knew how familiar this feeling was, and when the fire root was not taken away by the princess, there was such a feeling of affection for the fire, and now the system not only restores his fire root, but also complements the other attributes of the spirit root.
Each of the five levels has five levels, each of which is the highest level.
I'm going, it's going against heaven!
At last Xu Fu thought of this, and he could not help shaking his arm, "The system is in hand, I have the world, what a fart the princess emperor of the original land of fire, when I Xu Fu upgrade return, I will step on you all, step on your feet, and crush you."
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 아이돌아온다, '어디인가' 아이돌아온다."
"Tin, congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "to pretend to succeed, get the installed value of 1."
This is the first time I have ever seen him, and I have seen him, and I have seen him, and I have seen him, and I have seen him; I have seen him, and I have seen him, and I have seen him.
"Yes, experience Dan!"
He suddenly remembered that there was a first-grade experience Dan in the novice's package.
Without the slightest hesitation, the operator opened a package and three items appeared in it.
"Use, use," Xu Xu shouted, focusing on two of the items.
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "for the success of the" Five Elements of Taikoo. "
"Chin, the host" Xu Fu "took the first experience Dan, and got 10,000 points."
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "upgrade, the current state of the spiritual phase."
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Xu "upgrade, the current state of the three levels of breathing."
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Fu "upgrade, the current state of ten levels of breathing."
As a result of this, he was able to transform himself into a human being, and was able to reach the top of the ladder, only a few steps away from the top of the ladder.
In addition, his power is much greater than that of the normal ten degrees.
The reason is that he has five celestial roots, which is equivalent to a person who has five times the power to find ordinary people.
Even under the symbiotic nature of these five different spirits, the power that erupts is much more than five times as simple.
"This time, I am not invincible. Who is invincible?"
Xu Xu's heart could not stop being excited, but then the woman opposite was waving a stream of light across the sky, and the sharp edge of the dewy sword came like a viper in the blink of an eye.
"I will, fairy, I will only ask you, this little beauty, to come and take a good look at the concubine, who has let you out of the sword?
When he saw the sword coming, he was terrified, and opened his mouth.
It is not uncommon for a person to have his or her hands clenched in the water, and his or her hands clenched in the water, and his or her hands clenched in the water.
"When!"
A flicker of light flickered, and the sword flew out of his hand.
"How is that... possible?"
It is said that he was the son of the Prophet, and that he was the son of the Prophet, and that he was the son of the Prophet, and that he was the son of the Prophet.
"I don't know," he said, "I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
When the fire is extinguished, the fire is extinguished, and the fire is extinguished; when it is extinguished, the fire is extinguished, and the fire is extinguished.
After a short time, the four of them arrive at the house, where they are surrounded by a group of men and women, who are then arrested and imprisoned.
"What do you want to do?" she asks, "What do you want to do?"
"I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it."
He is shown to have a smile on his face, his eyebrows raised, and his hands clenched at the woman's dress.
If there is a future life, you will dance in the sky!
The Nine Heavens, the Sea of Clouds, the Wind Tower, the First Heaven!
Here, it is the nine-day continent, the last three days, a place of the dead, a place of the wind and a place of the lightning!
But at this moment, there is a murmur of stench on the thunderbolt!
"Chu Yang, hand over the nine swords, spare you not to die!"
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 아이돌아온차트 1 위, '내친구의집은어디인가' 아이유 (in Korean)."
The sound of her voice came from all sides.
The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Like the sword in his hand, full of indomitable meaning, even though he has been mortally wounded!
Under his feet, within a hundred feet of each other, there were numerous mutilated bodies, and blood was spilled.
There was a faint smile on his face, and he was proud and dismissive.
This is the kind of person, this kind of mentality, that is cultivated as high as the number of people; even if I can kill ten thousand times, I am not worthy of being an enemy.
In the end, it was revealed that he had a sword in his hand, and that he had spent the previous three days in the wind-mine, and that he had taken great pains to find an opportunity to risk his life to come to the last three days, but why had he encountered such a huge ambush after he had come here?
Today, in the last three days, it is only the fifth day! Today's fate, pure death!
I've done it a dozen times in a row, and each time, I've been blocked!
In the end, however, he will not be able to train himself to be a sword, and will be able to train himself to be a ninefold god of heaven.
Is it the wrong choice, or is it the wrong path at all?
If you are a merciless swordsman, if you are a merciless swordsman, who is a swordsman?
What is your secret?
As he gazes around greedily at the nine swords, Chuyang smiles bitterly: You only know that if you get the nine swords, you will be invincible, but you know how much I have paid for the nine swords.
It's nothing.
When he was about to die, he thought that his only regret was that he had not reached the highest level of his life, but he did not think that at this point in his life, a figure that he had long forgotten appeared in his mind.
Mo Wai Dai, Chu Yang's Horrible Woman
"I don't know, I don't know," he said with a smile.
A hint of remorse crept through his mind and, like a cloud of smoke, swept over his mind for a moment.
I don't know if I'm going to hell or if I'm going to meet you.
"If you don't believe me," he said, "you will not be able to do it; if you don't believe me, you will not be able to do it."
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공."
It was a night of love, a little poem written by Moe, and I remember, with tears in her eyes, and a bitter and bitter look in her eyes, she... knew that she was practicing with her feelings, but she still threw herself into her arms and let herself burn!
When he heard it, he ran away immediately, but after all, it was a step too late, and although he later killed all the people of the family who were hurting him, he never came back.
On his deathbed, he lay softly in his arms, and said to himself, "Chuyang, if there is an afterlife... if I meet you again, I hope you will look at me well... I look better than a sword!"
Dance lightly, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can you have tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two drops of tears, but I smashed my heart at that moment!
Life and Death
This was the first time in the history of the genre that a poem was written by a young man who was deeply moved by the poetry of Chu Yang.
And now, light dance, you have reached the nine heavens, and I am still in the world... but, I will be able to live and die with you immediately...
He always has a cold mouth and a gentle smile on his face.
Wait for me!
You know, if there is an afterlife, I'd rather not practice any swordsmanship, I'd rather not have any peak, I'd rather not avenge, I'd rather be with you!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
More and more swords are added, blood flashes out, pain flashes from all over the body, and finally the song and dance in my mind are interrupted!
Chūyō Furusato no Nagashirou!
Chu Yang looked down in pain, and the jade popped from his neck and shattered before his eyes.
This is the only memory left to me!
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 오늘 (9 일) 공개..." '내친구의집은어디인가' 출연확정 "(in Korean).
Bang ping-pong, all the weapons around him, neatly cut off!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, and looked in horror at the neat half-circle of weapons at the foot of Chuyang, and the cold sweat running down his waistcoat.
Chuyang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Nine Swords?"
When no one answered, he laughed and said, "Well, I'll show you the nine swords!"
He suddenly leapt up! He had been mortally wounded, and he leaped up!
"Nine swords, a little cold!"
As the arc erupts, thousands of colds burst forth!
The Nine Swords
Nine times heaven is the name of this continent, and all the swordsmanship of the past has never dared to use these three words, but the nine sword hijacking is simply the name "Nine times heaven"!
There is only one way!
Although Chu Yang was not able to exert the true power of the Nine Swords, he had long been aware of these swords, which were not as powerful as he had imagined, but far more powerful than the secular sword.
Each of the four men, who had been on the verge of death for some time, had a sword in his hand, and had a sword in his hand, so that he could hold it in his hand, so that he could not hold it.
"The Nine Swords."
The first move is not completed, the second move has come in a murderous air!
He was a good man, and a good man, and a good man, and a good man, and a good man, and a good man.
At this moment, everyone has an illusion: Now Chuyang, absolutely unhurt! Absolutely complete!
Unbeknownst to them, they interrupted Chuyang's recollection, interrupted his singing and dancing, and made him completely furious, fully realizing the full potential of his body! This is the power of life, the fury of his soul!
"Nine swords, one wind is the emperor!"
"Why, why not?"
In the distance, three directions, three lights rise at the same time, and in the sky, three golden shadows are transformed!
I am a warrior, but I am only one level from the king, but this level is no different from heaven and earth!
The Three Kingdoms
"But for the past three days, it's not a place where you can swallow a poisonous sword," one man said, "but I'm sorry I can't fight you fairly."
At the sound of the voice, the other two appeared together, all three of them in broad robes and long sleeves, waving in the wind, with a graceful posture and a calm face.
Chuyang's eyes are already blurred: "Your three kings... want the Nine Swords too?"
"But I want you to die!" The three of them smiled at the same time, as if to say, "But taking over the nine swords by the way is also an unexpected gain.
He laughed and said, "It's a pity you don't know the nine swords, you can never get them!"
He is now powerless to fight!
It is the only sword that he can use with all his might, and when he sees the sword, he knows that he can use it, but such a sword requires his own life to move it!
The Nine Swords Kill and Destroy Everything!
The three kings, almost too late to make a move, and the screams too far in the future, are gone! Even the illusion of the golden shadow of their royal power is still in the air, but their lives are in vain!
Chu Yang sighed, was in the middle of nowhere, his eyes wandering wildly, only to discover a figure whom he thought should never be here: in the distance, a white-clad man gazing at him with an unbelievable look on his face.
"Oh, God!" said Chuyang, looking at him, "why is it that such a covert action has been ambushed, and all the attacks have been stopped?"
It turned out to be him, and it was no wonder that he had lost so much!
Then he went to the door, opened it, and said, "Come in, and I will give you the keys of the house, and you shall have the keys of the house."
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest passion and the greatest hope! For there is a lover of his own!
Chapter II
It is said that he is the only one who can see the light of day, and that he is the only one who can see the light of day, and that he is the only one who can see the light of day, and that he is the only one who can see the light of day.
Subconsciously, Munch turned his head and looked at the hidden treasure next to him, wondering if he could see any sign of it.
To him, shame and frustration are small things, and to reveal the fact that one & apos; s body has been returned to one & apos; s soul is a big problem!
Xuanzang still had a bitter face, his eyes were depressed, and after feeling Monge's gaze, he shook his head gently: "There is no Amitabha in the south, everything depends on the decision of the master and brother."
In the end, he realizes that he has passed the test, and that he should not be seen unless his parents, who had abandoned the body, and the uncle of the horse, and so on, are summoned, and that if he were to remain for another ten years or eight years, there would be no doubt about it, and his childhood memories would be easily forgotten.
It's a small thing to get into a brothel!
In this way, he tries to make himself look as dull as Zhen Hui, so as not to be seen as depressed or sad by Genzo.
As a result, the number of children who had been admitted to the school was reduced from six to six, with the rest of the children being admitted to the school.
He struck his left palm gently with the bar of his right hand: "I will go to the monastery to shave, and lead the monks to the Buddhist scriptures, and so on, and I will have a hard time in the future, and I will not have the opportunity to enter the bodhi or the two chambers of Dhamma to practice the profound Buddhist scriptures and military exploits."
Is there Dharma here?
Monge is stunned, but does not give him time to think, and walks straight through the children and out of the temple.
Surrounded by strangers, Monge does not dare to ask more questions, and follows the two monks in yellow robes into a nearby courtyard.
"You're not a formal primer, you just have to worship the Buddha and shave your name."
"Yes, my uncle," replied the children, following Zhende, kneeling one by one on the futon and prostrating themselves to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshiped the Buddha, with their hands clasped in prayer, Bao Xiang solemnly bowed to the Buddha and recited "Namnu Amitabha," he went up to a child and put his right hand on his head.
The child's long black hair suddenly changes to yellow at the speed that Munch can see with the naked eye, falling to the ground like falling leaves, and within two breaths, the child becomes a real little shaman.
"The vexation is gone, the red dust is gone," he said solemnly, a mellow voice echoing in the pure halls of the Buddha.
"What is it? It's amazing!"
Monge is shocked and excited, wondering if he will ever have a chance to learn such a feat.
One by one he went to the children and removed their hair, and the same words were always spoken in his mouth.
When it is Monge's turn, he lowers his head, recites the name of the Buddha, and mourns the loss of his hair.
He is shown to have a very strong sense of humour, and when he falls in love with her, he is able to see her face, but he is unable to see her face, and he is unable to see her face.
"The trouble is over, the red dust is far away."
The sound of the bell echoed through the room like a rustling of bells, and Monchie shook his head and his mind was clear.
But after the bitter end has passed, the faith of Munch remains firm, and he must return to secular life!
After worshipping the Buddha, shaving, and reciting the name of the monk, Xuanzong asked several grey-clad monks to take the children to the backyard to receive their own things - two sets of gray monk robes, two pairs of shoes, the Shaolin Discipline, the Twelve Minor Mantras, and so on.
In the following verses, it is written: "When you have learned the words of the sutras, you will be able to recite the precepts of the temple and the small mantra of the morning lesson, and before that, I will give you an outline of the main precepts of the temple: 1) Do not deceive the master to destroy the father, 2) Do not permit, 3) Do not kill, 4) Do not drink, 5) Do not eat meat, 6) Do not break the precepts of the temple.
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the least severe and the most severe, and the rest were punishments such as hard labor, copying of scripture, caning, and face-walling.
After this incident, he and his family moved out of the house.
"In this temple, the people with the gray robes are the general monks, the people with the yellow robes are the deacons of the monasteries, the people with the red robes are the abbot's chambers, the heads of the monasteries and the elders..."
The more one walks, the more one looks at it, and the more one looks at it, the more one looks at it, and the more one looks at it.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공 '한끼성공' (종합)."
Frowning, he scrupulously said, "Namnu Amitabha, my brother, how can you be so lazy?"
The old man, who was already well acquainted with the bitter temper, did not get angry at all: "Oh, you are too attached to the foreign affairs, is this for us as a student of the juggling house?" He did not want to be entangled with the bitter temper on this issue, pointing directly to humanity such as Munch.
"I'm sorry," he said, "but I'm sorry."
At this point, the man who had been doing the saw-toothed gourd opened his mouth and said, "Really, is the truth still in the barn?"
"What do you want me to do?" he asked. "What do you want me to do?"
He shook his head and sighed, "I have destroyed my martial art, I am not going to be mistaken for a child, how dare I accept it?
He is the only one who knows the truth.
This is the first time that the two monks have been able to arrange their own affairs, and there is something special about the two monks that can help them.
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 아이돌아온다, '어디인가' 아이돌아온다."
And he said to them, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and the life, and the life, and the life; and I am the truth, and the life, and the life, and the life, and the life."
"But if I continue to be mischievous, lazy, playful, impetuous, and miserable, I will not conceal it, but will inform the College of Discipline and punish you accordingly."
He did not conceal his thoughts, and was frank, without any selfishness, with a blush on his face.
"Yes, my uncle," replied the little Shamizi, among others.
When he had finished, he turned his head and said, "I am going to see you, and I am going to see you."
This monk... Mengqi, disguised as a blind eye, followed the walking heart of the East swinging into the Zen room.
"It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true."
There is a room for seven or eight people to sleep in, and there is nothing else to do.
The two grey-clad monks, both in their twenties, were sitting on the floor, their faces dull and silent, and their eyebrows locked, in the tone of their voices: "Put your luggage on the floor and you'll be fine, I want to drink water, go to the cold water tank to get it." "I don't know what your brother calls you?"
Monge looks at Moomonne's wisdom and decides to establish a "roommate relationship."
The person sitting there is cold: "Truth."
As a result, he was unable to speak, and even turned his head away from Munch and Zhenghui, leaving Munch unable to bring himself closer to the subject.
He closes his eyes and goes back to sleep.
Who are these people?
"I am sure," he said, with a smile, "that you will be able to do what you have to do."
"Yes, sir," he said.
What a stupid little guy you are!
Monge sighed, and decided to play the role of a brother and help Zhenhui well: "Hey, I'll call your brother, come on, we'll change the monk's clothes first."
Although he was in the house, Monge, who was cold at the time of the university, did not feel well in his bedroom, so he quickly washed off his clothes and changed into a monk's robe.
He is able to see through his clothes, but he is unable to see through them, so he has to look at them before he can see them.
The body's robe, which is finely woven and soft in texture, can be seen to be priceless even if Munch does not recognize it, while "he" has a transparent jade cloth hanging from his waist, and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red rope around his neck, which clings to his chest and is cool and uncomfortable.
When Munch carefully played with the thumb-sized Jade Buddha, he saw that "it" had a merciful, lifelike face, and was clearly an extraordinary sculptor, while "it" had a delicate touch that was both warm and cool.
"What is the matter with you?" said the old man, "I have no idea what you are talking about, but I have no idea what it is."
Monge hangs the jade Buddha weight back on his chest, hides it close to his body, and then picks up the jade, clothes, etc. and places them under the bunk that he has chosen.
At the end of the episode, he falls asleep in his car, but is unable to see what is going on.
"It's time for dinner," he said coldly, and went down the aisle and out the door.
Who are they?
Monge curses again, and then turns his head to Zhen Hui: "Little Master, are you all right?
"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the little rabbit, as if he were starving.
"What is it?" he asks, "is it normal?"
He paused at the door and looked back at Munch, wondering, "Master, don't you go?"
You have a little conscience, you know how to wait for me!
"I am not as hungry as you are," he replied, half-jokingly.
Look at you, one by one, like a starving baby!\ Q >
He turned and looked at me.
After a few minutes, he said, "Hey, little brother, wait for me!"
In the end, he has a crush on her, which is why he has a crush on her, and why he doesn't have a crush on her in the future.
A woman of twenty-eight years old, with a handsome face, and a boy of five or six years old, kneel in front of the iron door of a luxurious villa.
A woman named Zhao Meiling, from a remote mountain village, who had been studying at a university with dreams and hopes six years ago, but did not expect to meet a man who changed everything about her, this man is the famous flower of Beitang city...
At the time, Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were at a school, and by accident, she was taken in by Li Zhe, who then began to pursue Zhao Meiling madly, almost unscrupulously.
She was a simple and honest girl who had just arrived in the city, and that would be the opponent of such a scene, not only the body, but also the heart was completely handed to him, but then Li Zhe played with her and abandoned her severely.
Later, Cho Mi-ling finds out that she is pregnant and wants to have a child, which she does not hesitate to do with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meilin thought that a man would raise him as an adult, but after five years, because she was too tired to live for a few years, she finally decided to send the child to the Li family to feel the love of her father and have a better life, so that she could be relieved after her death.
However, this was rejected by the Li family, who refused to acknowledge that the child belonged to the Li family, and Zhao Meiling was forced to kneel before the iron gate with the child and begged hard.
At this point, the iron door slowly opens, and several people come out with umbrellas, and the first man and the little boy are somewhat similar, he is the little boy's father, Li Zhe.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공 (종합)."
Cho Mi-ling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must leave your son behind, he is your son!"
Li refused, and then said coldly, "Do you want the money?"
In the middle of the song, Miriam breaks down and shakes her head.
At this, Li screamed, threw his check at Zhao Miling, and was about to turn away.
On his knees, Zhao Meiling clutched Li Zhe's thigh and begged him, "Zhe!"
"Pam!"
In the end, Cho Mei Ling did not finish, and Li Che hit her face with a slap, "Let go, you stinky woman."
The little boy saw his mother being beaten and ran to him, holding his thigh and shouting, "Dad, don't hit your mother."
In fact, the little boy does not know who his father is from birth, and his mother does not say it again until this time when Zhao Miling shows the little boy a picture of Li Zhe, and the little boy realizes that he has a father and is happy to jump up.
But now he doesn't understand why his father doesn't want to be his mother, and why he wants to fight his mother.
Li Jie looked at the little boy holding his own thigh, a look of disgust on his face, and kicked the little boy out with one foot, "Who is your father?
The boy was trampled out, fell to the ground, curled up, and covered with a face of pain far more than a five-year-old boy could bear, and tears came from his eyes.
"What are you going to do?" she asked. "I'm going to do it," he said, "and I'm going to do it.
The little boy, looking at his mother's fear, opened his mouth, and shook his head, holding back tears.
The two of them went into the iron gate, and when they came to the side of the gate, a man with white hair, who looked like a housekeeper, picked up the cheque, and handed it to Zhao Miling, who said, "Take it again!"
She shakes her head, holding the little boy in her arms, and slowly disappears into the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the mother and child, sighed deeply, turned around and walked slowly into the house, closing the iron door.
Four years later, on her deathbed, Zhao Mei-ling called a nine-year-old boy to her bed, gently rubbed his head, smiled weakly, and said, "You can study well in the future, you can have a good job in the future, and don't resent the Li family, and don't resent your father, will you promise me that?"
The little boy holds out his tears and nods his head.
Looking at the boy with a serious nod of approval, Zhao Mi-ling has a serene smile on her face and slowly closes her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the evening, a bright moon hangs high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shines on the earth, so that it is not dark around.
"Boom!"
Suddenly there was a deafening sound in the sky, and Zhao Fu looked up at the sky, and saw the whole sky as if it were burning, turning into a huge sea of fire, with countless colorful lights, dragging a long tail, something like a shooting star falling from the sky.
"Bang!"
With a loud bang, a shimmering meteor fell in front of Zhao Fu, and the dazzling light stopped him with his hand, and then the strong light dispersed, and a single, two-fingered, thick hedron floated silently in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao approached curiously, grasped the hedron, and floated in the middle of the hedron without reacting, and was seized by Zhao.
At this time, the sleeping people were also awakened by a series of loud sounds, opening the door or opening the window, looking at the numerous crystals floating in the air, and began to rush out of the house in a frenzy to seize the stones, and Zhao Pu did not stay much in his place and hurried back to his home.
In a single rented room, Zhao Fu looked closely at the hedron, and if the hedron was sold, there was no stone comparable to the hedron, and if the hedron was small in number, the value of the hedron would not even be known, but the key was the number of hedrons that fell from the sky, or even the appearance of tens of billions of dollars, so the hedron might not be of value at all.
"Detecting the host as a primal intellect and beginning to bind the soul..."
The soul is bound, and begins to travel to the Apocalypse.
After this sound, Zhao Fu fainted on the ground with black eyes. "Hong Dai, male, 22 years old, orphan, unfortunately died for saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. After the relevant departments decided to pursue Hong Dai as a hero, outstanding university students in the province."
"No, no, no, I don't want to go with you to Hongjia," said Tang Mo Xin, burying his head in his pillow and desperately kicking at Bai Nen's lower leg: "Hongdae is a famous waste of the whole city, and they have lost their faces, and they are sick and crooked, and their minds are not light, and they are a standard loser, so I don't want to find such a person as my fiancé!"
He is the only one of the members of the House of Lords, and the only one of the members of the House of Lords to have been a member of the House of Lords, and the only one of the members of the House of Lords to have been a member of the House of Lords, the House of Lords, the House of Lords, and the House of Lords.
But today, hearing his father say that he would take him to the famed family of Hongdae, how could she have received it: "Had it not been for his parents' affection for her, a thousand years ago, he would have been driven out of Hongdae to die on his own, would he have had such a chance?"
"I don't know," she said, "but I don't think I can do it."
You and Hung's relationship was decided by your grandfather himself in the past, and although he lost his family, it is not a big problem.
He was dressed in a turquoise vest, with a spotless white sweater, a simple bow tie at the collar, a faint stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, a black short hair meticulously combed back, a bright and polished look, and a pretty good figure, but his eyes are now full of helplessness and unhappiness.
In the end, it is revealed that he is the only one who is willing to give up his life, and the only one who is willing to give up his life, and the only one who is willing to do so, is the one who is willing to give up his life.
He is best known for saying, "I have to lose my family, will I not lose my parents" ability to make money? "
This is a joke that no one in the city knows, and many parents educate their children to say, "If you dare to learn a lot about that loser, see that I don't break your leg!"
In fact, this is the kind of thing that Mackenzie would have done, even if it had been in his mind.
"Well, then," he said, "what do you want me to do?" "Well," he said, "I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it.
As Tang Mu Xin woo put it, "It is easy for a relative to leave his family, and his family is one of the world's top 500 enterprises.
I have to say that Don is a very smart girl.
If her house falls, she will never be able to get better, and this is how the world is, the law of the jungle. When you are strong, no one dares to move you, but when you are really falling, there will be no fewer people who will come and fall.
It had been a long time since I had seen her.
"I don't know," he said, "but I don't know how to explain it, and I don't know how to explain it, but I don't know how to explain it."
"Well," he said, "if you want to go, you have to go." "No," he said.
He sits down on the bed, his eyes dazed and his mind confused.
It was a strange thing to think about, and it was a very strange thing to think about, but it was a very strange thing to think about, and it was a very strange thing to think about.
"Am I not dead, and here, and where?" thought Hung, looking at his pale, slender hands. "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live.
After looking around for a while, he thought, "The first thing we need to do is figure out what's going on."
"First, I am now dead or alive. Second, where is this place, who is my identity? Third, what should I do next?"
"Now, let's get to the first point," he says, rubbing a small piece of skin on the back of his left hand. "I feel pain, so I should be alive." He touches his face, neck, ears, and top of his head. "This body is obviously not my body, but it is still in the human realm."
"Then there's the second question, where is this place, who am I?" Hong looked around, at the reinforced concrete house structure, the snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD in the corner of the room: "Modern society is right, but I've never seen the stars on the walls, and I've never heard of the toy models.
There was no one around, and Hung carefully stood up and took a deep breath: "This body is weak enough, like a thin bamboo pole, I really do not know when it will suddenly die."
When he opened his computer and opened several Web sites, the content displayed was very different from that on Earth, but at least he was able to figure out a few things: "First, this world, or this country's characters, or Chinese characters; second, it is indeed a parallel space, and many things are different from the earth, but not much.
"Well," he said, "it's not that I don't like it, but it's not that I don't like it, and it's not that I don't like it, and I don't like it, and I don't like it, and I don't like it."
"Defeated system binding success, current level: one."
In the middle of the story, a young man appears, who looks like himself.
"Name of host: Hong Dao."
Sexual capacity: 32. Note: The index for normal persons is 100. "
Hong was stunned and asked, "Is this really true or false?"
As a result, he was forced to resign from his position at the end of the war, and he was forced to resign from his position: "For every 100,000 renminbi (RMB) lost, the host will receive an attribute point."
When all the attributes of the host reach the normal level, the Defeated system will be upgraded, and new items will be added, so please look forward to it. "
There is nothing better than to be able to improve one's own attributes, "Can you really acquire attributes through a loser and become like a normal person?"
The sound of the system was still so cold, but now it sounded like a song: "Yes."
Hong was so excited that he barely jumped up: "I'm going to splurge! I'm going to lose!"
"Then ask the host to take on the first task: the first defeat: the task is to lose at least $100,000 before midnight today.
"Current loser amount: 0."
"I'm on it, it's already eight o'clock in the evening, there are only four hours left, no, I'm going out, I'm going to lose!"
As I thought of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid, about forty years old, bowed violently to Hong, and said softly, "Master violently, my lord and wife let you pass, please come with me."
"Do you want to buy me a cabin?" asked Jiang Fei to his father with anticipation.
"Little Fay, you are now in high school and can no longer indulge in games as you used to!"
"Mother! This game is not the same! This is a 13-year masterpiece by Shengsheng, which claims to be the second world of mankind!"
This game, which Jiang Fei-speaking is called "Dawn Light," is indeed another innovation in the history of mankind, it is not only a model of virtual reality game, it is close to 100% realistic, but also a completely new technology that allows the player to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through which the human body can enjoy eight hours of good sleep physically, but mentally experience a completely different magic life!
"This game is being promoted by the state! It is not deceptive, it is not only a game that does not interfere with learning, but also gives people a better rest!"
Jiang Fei is still holding on!
"The last time I said, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework in 20 seconds, then the next month's pocket money will be cut by 50%!"
"Old stubborn!"
"I have no idea what you're talking about," he said, "but I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't know what you're talking about."
After the school bell rings, the teacher leaves, and a small fat man steps on his shoulder after Jiang flies away.
Don't mention it, I can't play with you this time! "
All my brothers point to you! "
He is one of only a handful of people in the school who are not very good at sports, and he is the only one who is not very good at sports, so he can be considered as a transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree with me, what can I do?" Jiang flipped his eyes, and he didn't say anything to the only friend.
"Would you like to buy one for your brothers?" Zhao Feng said, "The relationship between these two transparent people who are not paid attention by teachers and students is very good because they are similar to Jiang Fei's conditions and are not good in all aspects.
He consoled himself.
"May it be so!"
He shook his head.
As a boy, does not want to fight a sword man? A big man with a sword of three feet, it is a dream of every man, but it is a peaceful era, and it is a highly developed society of science and technology, not to mention there is no war, even if there is war, it is also pressing the button, so if you want to enjoy the heat of battle, you can only experience it in a virtual game!
This time, however, Jiang Fei had no hope, and since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been given a limited entertainment order by his father, and all the game equipment in the house is sealed, and the online game is not talked about!
It was not until about 6 o'clock in the evening that he was able to go home, but because it was already in winter, it was very dark.
At about 10: 00, Jiang Fei also completed his homework, lying on his back on his bed, looking at the wall clock a little closer to 10 o'clock, which was not in his mind.
The game starts at 10pm this evening and runs eight hours a day from 10pm to 6am the next morning, allowing players to enjoy the full twenty-four hours of gameplay without sacrificing their normal lives.
He grinned and put his hand on the ring finger.
"What is it?"
Jiang Fei, the boss of the mouth Zhang, looking at the ring with a faint glow in his hand, is a little too scared to speak!
Buzzing! "
A white light flashes by, and Jiang's eyes are in front of him, and when the line of sight is again clear, his eyes are no longer in his room!
"Welcome to the world of Dawn! # 34784 Newbie Assistant at your service!"
A crisp female voice enters Jiang Fei's ear!
"Dawn? Is this the landing interface for Dawn?"
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface!" replied the assistant.
It is also difficult to imagine that Jiang Fei does not have a game compartment at all, so how can he get into the game?
Maybe I'm too tired to do my homework, so I lie down in bed and fall asleep, including the mysterious ring that just happened to be part of the dream, thinking about it every day, dreaming every night, maybe I want to play this game too much!
"Hustler! Hustler!"
An angry moan followed, followed by the sound of footsteps on the ground.
"I'm not a liar, I'm a college teacher... I just want you to be my student! And even if I were a liar, why should I add a 'big' word?"
After murmuring, Zhang paused and shook his eyebrows, "If I can't get a student today, I can roll up my sleeves and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang is not a person of this world, but a general college library administrator of the earth, remembering only the blazing fire, and then... then there is no more, waking up again to this world.
In the same way as in the novel, the martial arts are great, and the king is strong!
I thought I could pass through a waste wood, I was deserted, I hit my face against it, I sang all the way... It seemed like a lot of thought, but when I came here, I found out that it was not a student, but...
One of the worst teachers in the entire academy!
His class, which was crowded and crowded, had no one, so it was hard for him to pull in a few, and at the end he scolded several "liars," and then turned around and ran away!
"'한끼줍쇼' 이유, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', '한끼성공', 한끼성공 (종합)."
It is like a dead man in a hospital, whose fame has been greatly damaged, who has been spurned, and who, even if he is a new student, is far away one by one, afraid to fall into his hands, and taught to be half dead!
It was the first time in the school's history that a student had been admitted, and the only time in the history of the school's history that a student had been admitted to the school.
When he is depressed, he gets drunk, and as a result, he hangs up and takes advantage of the opportunity.
At the start of the new school year, the college gives an ultimatum to dismiss a teacher if no more students can be enrolled in his class this year!
Today, seventeen new students have passed his classroom, and as a result, upon hearing his name, all of them run away without exception, like a little girl who meets the strange Shrimp, how fast he is running.
"It seems like we have to find a way to get rid of one!"
When he sees a girl, he is surprised to see her with her head out of the door.
"Is this Mr. Lu's class?"
She is sweet, sweet, and beautiful.
As a result, the school's faculty and staff are always full of students, many of whom come to the school.
"I saw her," he said, "and I saw her with her eyes closed.
Remembering the trappings of his past life, he sat quietly in his seat, posing as an exalted man: "Do you want to worship him as a teacher?"
The girl nodded her head like a sparrow, and the dark eyes were full of worship: "I heard that Mr. Lu is the most powerful teacher of Hongtian College, the student of the professor, each person has extraordinary strength, and everyone is proud to be able to join his class!"
"No matter how well he says it, it does not match your theory of cultivation, it will not improve, it will not improve, it will fall back!
The girl paused for a moment, and her beautiful eyes were a little confused: "But I don't know what kind of class I am!"
After a moment of hesitation, Marx, Enkos, and the others came to mind and pretended to be in trouble: "Encounter is fate, so I'm a teacher at this college, too, and I can help you see your roots, your talent, your temperament, and recommend the right teacher for free!"
I didn't expect to meet this teacher at all, so much so that the girl nodded her head in excitement.
"Let me show you how to do it!"
His eyes are half-closed and seem to be unconcerned.
"Yes!"
Huh, Huh, Huh!
For a short time, a fist whirls in the room, a path like a dragon scurries around the girl, the whole person breathes, does not break, does not show, represents that she has a great foundation.
"Well, I can see that you are a serious, hard-working, well-grounded, gifted, unseen genius!"
He is the only one who knows how to tell the truth, but he is not the only one who knows how to tell the truth, he is the only one who knows how to tell the truth.
"Teacher, I've got a leg wound and the doctor says it's basically the same thing..."
"Wounded..." his face flushed, but it was so thick that no one could see it, and he continued to ridicule: "Do you think I don't see it?
If you are blind, you will be blind, and if you are blind, you will be blind.
"What is it?," "What is it?," "What is it?"
She has a broken leg and feels bad about it, so she doesn't know what to do with it.
"This is the first time I've ever been able to do this," he said, "but it's not the first time I've been able to do this, it's the first time I've been able to do this, it's the second time I've been able to do this."
When she heard that she could be the first to be born, and boasted that she was a genius, the girl's face was uncontrollably hot, and she asked hastily, "But what?"
"But..." Zhang sighed with a sigh of relief that a talented person was about to be buried: "There are not many teachers who can see this opportunity!
"Don't take students?" The girl, who had hoped so much, looked a little dull, and then jumped up and said, "They don't take students, that teacher... you can't take them?"
"Of course I am, but, you see, I'm not so famous, and I don't have so much time!"
Putong!
Before I finish, the girl falls to the ground: "I know Mr. Gao Jie, please accept me as a student! I will do well, I will not lose my teacher's face!"
"I don't want to be a teacher, I don't want to be a teacher, I don't want to be a teacher, I don't want to be a teacher.
"I don't have many students, I don't have as many resources as other teachers, and I'm going to be criticized..."
"I heard that it was important to train resources..." the girl hesitated.
A teacher & apos; s access to resources at a college is tied to the number and grades of the students being taught, and if the resources are insufficient, it will be difficult to progress.
"Well, then," she said, "I am going to ask you a question, and I am going to ask you a question, and I am going to ask you a question, and I will answer it."
"It's... so fast?"
It is not uncommon for a teacher to turn his / her face over like a book, and the girl is surprised to receive a token of his / her identity, and to think about whether or not he / she is going to be able to verify his / her identity, and to see that the teacher who was very calm has pulled her hand over her hand and pulled out a sharp knife, and a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Dum!
The light shines.
The girl was stunned.
How can it be so fast, and... the knives are ready?
"From now on, you will be my student!" With a sigh of relief, Zhang asked, "What's your name?"
"To my teacher, my name is Wang!"
It is no longer possible to change the face of a woman, but to change the face of a man.
"Well, take your identity card, take your bedding, your books, and find your own place of residence!
The Hand.
"Yes!" the king nodded and turned away.
"Hit the last one!"
When he saw her, he smiled and smiled.
It's not easy, and if it wasn't for a lot of blackmail techniques on the internet, I'm afraid it would still be difficult to succeed today.
It is said that he was able to escape from the fate of being expelled, and that he felt that the spirit of the whole person had been smoothed out at a moment's notice, and that the point of attachment in the foreground of the mind was slowly disappearing.
"Rest assured, I will live for you if I go through it!"
This was the first time a student had ever been admitted to the school, and it was the first time a student had ever been admitted to the school, and the last time a student had ever been admitted to the school, he had not yet been admitted.
Bang!
After a few minutes of silence, the students were able to hear the sound of the bell, and then the sound of the bell.
Bang!
After a few moments of silence, he sees a large palace with five large letters shining on it.
Tian Dao Library!
The doors were pushed in, the shelves were filled with books of all kinds, and there was no end in sight.
"The library? Nima, I've been a librarian for the rest of my life.
The book is about the life of an old man, not the life of an old man, but the life of an old man, and the life of an old man, and the life of an old man.
Is it a fight, someone else throws a sword, I throw a book?
"What is it?"
In the book, he tries to find out what is going on in the library, but only to find out that his hand has passed through the bookcase and has been emptied.
"Are you playing with me? Give me a library and I can't get any books, I can't see anything, what are you going to do?"
He is silent and does not cry.
Chapter 1
Oh, My Tattoo!
Chao Yu-taek opened his sleeves and looked in amazement at his two white, tender arms, which had previously been tattooed with two jaw-dropping claws, the domineering green dragon!
What... is it all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found himself sitting in a glaring office with a small office partition on the front and back.
At this moment, the phone was ringing, paper documents were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were moving rapidly in the hall, all in a confused look.
At this point, a middle-aged man wearing a brown jacket quickly came up to the crowd and shouted, "Mr. Qu Ping is now telling you the case of the electric rod strong * rape case, tonight we will start the action, everyone pay attention to it!"
A whiteboard was quickly pulled up, filled with words and pictures.
When they arrive, they are greeted by a large crowd of people, who pull up their chairs and sit in front of the whiteboard.
Zhao Yu did not move and remained seated in his seat.
His right ear had been cut in two by a small melee during a previous fight.
Zhao wanted to look at his face in the mirror, but suddenly he saw a picture on his desk of a handsome young man in police uniform who looked exactly like him!
My grandmother, a bear! Shocked, a bunch of strange memories burst into his mind like a flood of the Yellow River, and Zhao began to realize that...
He is also known by his real name, Zhao Yu, but the people of Jianghu prefer to call him Zhao Tianbao!
Grandma a Bear!
Zhao Yu was shocked again, and he finally remembered that he had been executed by injection!
But when I read it... how did I get here?
Did I really go through?
And is it seamless, with no reincarnation at all?
As new memories flood in, he is surprised to discover that there is a parallel world similar to the one before him, and that his current status is that of an agent of the Mobile Crime Squad, and that he is actually a policeman!
This hall, where he is now, is no other than the office of the police!
Zhao Yu could not believe his own eyes, such a huge contrast could not have been imagined, a senior little chisel turned into a serious crime squad agent, which... what makes sense?
He has a long black hair on his head, and he has long black hair on his head, and he has long black hair on his head, and he has long black hair on his head.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 12 년만에 3 개월만에한끼성공... '한끼성공' (종합)."
She is the leader of Group B of the Major Crime Squad, and although she is small in age, she has a steady manner and a high crime rate, and is the red person in front of the leader.
"The victims were all beautiful young women, and they all had bad lifestyle problems," the team leader, Qu Ping, said. "Most of the incidents occurred in the vicinity of bars, cabarets, and other places of decency, and the murders were committed after midnight."
& quot; According to the victim & apos; s statement, the perpetrator first followed the victim into the empty alley, then coronated her with an electric baton, and then committed a strong * rape.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공."
Zhao Yue glanced at him and saw that he was Liu Changhu, the deputy commander of the Mobile Team of the Serious Crimes Unit, who, during the period of Zhao Yushi Xi, had no less than Zhao Yue of the tribe, and who sent him letters every day to pour tea, just as he had sent messengers.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a king, but a big boy with a weak personality who has just finished his internship and turned into a regular policeman, and not only Liu Changhu, but many senior colleagues will joke about him and arrange some work that should not be his.
It is not a matter of time, but it is a matter of time, and it is a matter of time.
His sudden rise scared Liu Changhu, and even the leader of Qu Ping had to stop.
As they all looked at Zhao, a woman with a silver bell suddenly appeared in front of him, and a girl with a braided ponytail and big glasses appeared before them.
The girl is a newly assigned intern clerk in the Serious Crimes Unit, whose name is Li Bei; the girl is an idiot, and after less than a month of contact, she sees Zhao Yu alive.
Although he has a weak personality, he is often bullied by others, but he is a talented person with a height of 1.78 meters, a jade tree, a handsome young man, and a certain amount of damage to the opposite sex.
At this point, seeing her loved one being shouted at, Li quickly stepped forward to relieve the situation: "Captain Liu, I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm still on my internship, and I'm naturally doing this work!"
After that, Li Bei smiled at Zhao and ran to the tea room in the hall for coffee.
Zhao Yu, too, had trouble with his temper, so he sat down again and continued to think about his own crossing, but his memory was very clear, as he had been lying on a chaise longue just a few minutes earlier; in his previous life, he had been sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yuxin knows that he was framed and did not kill at all! The person who was killed was the owner of a real estate group, and Zhao Yu only beat him once according to the instructions of his superiors, and could not die at all.
Moreover, even if he is beaten to death, it is a manslaughter, and he should not be sentenced to murder!
With that in mind, Zhao was furious and his fist clenched, and if the people who had framed him were to be found later, they would have to pay twice as much!
By this time, she had made a cup of coffee and given it to each of her colleagues, and the little girl's face was filled with enthusiasm, and with every cup she gave, she was kind enough to encourage her colleagues by saying, "You've worked hard," "Come on," and so on.
"Police Officer Zhao, this cup contains two packets of sugar!
After a short time, Li Bei took over the business.
By this time, the case had been completed, and the chief of the major crime group, Kim Chun-bong, who was more than 50 years old, was an old man who was very serious about his work.
Captain Kim said loudly, "There have been three cases of electric batons, and one more will be classified as a chain of events. Not only the top, but we can't wear this big hat!
So, let's try to solve the case in the shortest time possible! "So... Group A sent a person to the scene of the crime, and since the culprit was the culprit who followed the victim, he must have appeared in the bar cabaret where the victim was before, and called out all the surveillance there, I must find this person!
"Yes!"
"Group B, you are mainly in charge of checking the evidence!" the captain ordered. "There is no evidence against the culprit, and the line of blood does not work. But the culprit's urine is an important clue, and although the police cannot find a match, you can go to the hospital or medical center to check the evidence, and if the person has done a medical check or stayed in the hospital, you will find him!"
"Yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the culprit, the cell phone signal that appeared at the scene, the only victim who saw the culprit, these clues can not be ignored, and all need to be followed up!"
"Yes!"
"All right," said the captain, "if there is nothing wrong with the action plan, let's go as soon as possible!"
"Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!"
When they look back, they find that the person they are talking to is none other than Zhao Yue.
Captain Kim was also stunned and asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu? What's wrong with you?"
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said, "I'm not feeling well, go home first, play yourself!"
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the office of the director of the senior private hospital of the city of East.
"Mr. Lee is one of the directors of Ling Yun Group, he owns 40 (percent) of our hospital, and you must give him priority to detoxification!"
In the face of the Dean's fury, Han Yuseo, with his hands in the pockets of his white coat, was calm. "I'm sorry, Dean Lin, but Mr. Lee has chronic venom in him.
She is a beautiful woman, with large eyes and a pair of small pearls, known for her amazing acupuncture talent at a young age, and is a rare expert in detoxification, whether dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins, or endotoxins.
"You know, this is Ling Ling!"
"Enough, don't tell me that all doctors are equal, only men and women, and I tell you, Han Yusei, arrange for detoxification now, or, as of today, get out of the medical profession!"
I thought that Han would be scared, but she was still calm and serious, "Mr. Lin, there is no distinction between men and women in front of me, there are only two kinds of people, I want to save and I do not want to save, Mr. Lee I do not want to save, please ask another person."
When she finished, she smiled politely, turned around, and walked away, her seemingly thin body elegant and serene, with a kind of arrogance that cannot be ignored.
"Han, you dare to speak to me like that, you stop me!"
In the middle of the book, she is shown to be lying on her back, her head resting on the back of her head, her head resting on the back of her head.
Three Thousand Years Ago.
He wakes up in the middle of the night and hears the sound of the bell ringing, and the sound of the bell ringing.
What's going on?
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 오늘 (6 일) 공개..." '내친구의집은어디인가' 출연확정 "(in Korean).
It was the first time in my life that I had ever heard of a woman who had been married to a man who had been married to a woman who had never been married before.
It is said that she was the daughter of the Korean family of the medical family of Tanningguo (天宁国医科世家韓家), and was also called Han Yusei, because the birth mother medicine technique saved the queen at that time, that is, the current Empress Dowager, and that her belly was married to the seven princes of the time, that is, the current Qin Wang Longfei, which was still a good word at that time, and the status of the Korean family soared.
However, no one knows that Han Yusei was born and died, and grew up to be a waste material ugly woman who did not know medicine, so the marriage was delayed again and again as a taboo of the Qin king, and the Qin king annoyed the emperor for a few days, and the emperor ordered the marriage to be completed by the end of the month.
He is the only surviving son of the late King George VI, and the only surviving son of the late King George VI, who is the only surviving member of the royal family.
The king of Qin was in the south of the city, the Han family was in the north of the city, the carriage had to pass through the city from the north to the south, and the king of Qin was married, even if he himself did not appear, but it led to the empty streets, and the whole city was a sensation.
As Hankyu was sorting out these memories, the joy suddenly stopped, and he only listened to his mother's cries, "It's bad, it's bad, it's bad!"
CHAPTER I
"I'm going to get up," he said, "and I'm going to get up."
He opened his eyes and saw a young face that existed only in his memory.
"What?"
"Wake up, hurry up and wash your face, and tell you not to drink, you must drink, and fall asleep without looking at the spring night," said Feng with a smile.
Is it New Year's Eve?
He looked at her, and she saw that he was looking at her, and she saw that he was looking at her, and she saw that he was looking at her, and she saw that he was looking at her, and she saw that he was looking at her.
Is it not the old house of his family's farm as a child, which was demolished with the construction of a small town, and how did his sister become so young?
It was not a joke, because his hands were getting smaller and his arms were getting thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood at the door frame with the mark he made with his knife on New Year's Day, the highest line, 166 cm in 1988.
Is it 1988? Has he not yet graduated from middle school?
Is it not a dream that he choked himself with force and almost cried out in pain?
Feng Yu opened the door, and his mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen; he lived in a hut, the kitchen was outside, the living room was on the other side of the kitchen, and on the farm he called the house.
"Do you want to drink?" he asked, looking at his son.
She looked at her mother, who had black hair, and her eyes were wet.
"Yes, you are."
"What do you say, little boy?" "Wash your face quickly, go into the room to watch TV for a while, and the dumplings will be ready soon."
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled, and in the future, as soon as he was able to earn money, his father was found to be in the final stages of a brain tumor and died in less than three months, without even spending a penny he had earned.
It was a long time before he was able to speak to her.
He looked at his son, and said, "Well, what do you think of that?" "I don't know," he said.
"I want to talk to you," he said, "and I want to talk to you."
He has never had a drink with his father in his life, and now Feng has a strong desire to drink with his father again.
"I don't have a long memory, that's it, and I'll drink a little more, and I think you'll get up tomorrow and go to the New Year!
Fong shook his head in frustration and turned to grab a beer and a glass.
The house also has a single bed with bedding. Feng Danying, who went to school and stayed with his mother during the holidays, slept in the same bed as Feng Xingtai, but three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
On the west wall of the living room was a three-door wardrobe with two suitcases, and on a solid wooden table was a 14-inch black and white television, which was being played on New Year & apos; s Eve.
In the middle of the living room stood a folding round table, which was already filled with dishes and chopsticks. There were eight dishes, but all of them were leftovers from the evening. There were chickens and fishes and elbows, and all of them were meat dishes, not a single vegetarian dish.
Fong Yu did not look at the TV, but went to the front of the wardrobe and looked carefully in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door, New Year & apos; s Eve, 16 February 1988.
He can now be sure that he is born again!
The mother cooked the dumplings quickly, and Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help with the dumplings, and after all four sat down, Feng Xingtai took the chopsticks.
"Oh, my God, you're drinking!" he shouted.
"Let me go," he said, "and let me go."
He shook his head, and went to the door, which was open, and there was a knock at the door.
"Dad, Mom, Sister, Happy New Year, Cheers!"
There was no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house, no one in the house.
After dinner, Feng went back to his hut to lie down, and as he lay in bed, he turned his back on his life.
Fong Yuben was a middle-aged man in his forties who made his own investment after resigning from a securities firm.
He had a wife, no children, his father died early, and his mother lived with him.
He remembers that it was the spring of 2015, when he wanted to earn more money to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, so he mortgaged all of his family's savings, including his house and car, and borrowed a large sum of money, all of which he invested in the stock market, which, according to his prediction, was a bull market.
After a very good start, his investment quickly doubled, and he boldly leveraged an investment firm to make more money, doubling it once more, so that he could do nothing for the rest of his life.
When the stock market reached 5,000, he, like many others, was greedy enough to think that it could continue to rise, and it did start to rise again, but it soon jumped, because he used a lot of leverage without adding money, and he lost a lot of money. After returning the borrowed money, he became destitute.
He went bankrupt, drank a lot of alcohol that day, and then fell on the road, deliberately, in the presence of many people, and was hit by a lorry.
This should not be considered suicide; he would have taken out the accident insurance, which would have paid him several million dollars to get his house and car back, and would have left a sum of money for his mother and wife.
He remembers watching the lorry fly by and thinking that if God could give him a chance to come back, he would not die like that again, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But God gave him a chance to come back!
Since God has made him come back, the regrets of his past life will never be repeated in this life; he will become a rich man, and he will become a legend in the world of investment!
"No, I don't want to go to bed.
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted, and at the same time complained about his husband and how he had his son drink again at night.
When he heard the voice of his mother complaining, Feng Yu smiled, turned around, and fell asleep sweetly.
Monday, 20 May 2019.
It is the summer solstice.
During this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan region is wide, with trousers being worn as dogs during the day and frostbitten in their nests at night.
Jiangnan University.
In the movie, he is seen sitting on a desk in the living room, watching movies in various positions.
It was not until the last night of the season that he was able to make his way to the top of the league table, where he was able to score two goals in the first half of the season.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply, and Song Shuhang, who was covered with a small trousers, was forced to sleep, his hands groping in his bed, searching for it, but could not touch the quilt, and finally shrank into the shape of a skin and shrimp, trembling under the power of the midnight cold wind.
When the sun rises, Song becomes a member of the seasonal cold army.
My roommate has taken a leave of absence for today's class.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
With his fever gone and his body in a state of exhaustion, he could not attend classes at all, so he had to stay alone in his dorm room and watch a boring movie.
On the screen, the progress bar of the film slowly moves forward, but Song does not see any of the film's content.
"It's not over yet, I'm sleepy," he yawned, his eyes heavy.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동 X 한끼성공, 한끼성공 (종합)."
This is a reminder to add him as a friend or join a group.
"Who added me?" muttered Song Shu Hang, reaching out to the bottom right corner of the computer screen for a tap, prompting a message.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Who, then, is this strange nickname?
"What is it?" he asked, in a low voice, "is it not so?" "It is not so," he said. "It is not so."
When asked, he replied "Yes."
Soon after, another system message popped up.
(黄山真君招待你 "九洲一群" ， 同意?)
Song continued to agree.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동 X 한끼성공 (종합)."
[You have agreed to join the group and say hello to the group!]
This year the chat tool does more and more humanized.
After a series of prompts popping up, Song agreed to turn off the hints and the group chat window - now that he's up in his sleep, who has the energy to control what group he's adding?
In any case, his group setting has always been "show only the number of messages without prompting," and group chats do not pop up to disturb him, but only show the number of chats after the group.
Once he is awake, he can go over the chat records and find out which group he belongs to, and the chat records of the members of the group are not lost.
The film continues to progress steadily, and the song's storyline is becoming more and more obscure.
In the first group of Jiuzhou, after seeing a new member join, there were diving members in the group. 北河散人: "Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Tao friend came in? It has been more than a year without a new member?"
"'한끼줍쇼', 강호동 X 한끼성공 (종합)."
What is wrong with this chain of questions?
"No, no, no, no, no, no!
"Do you really belong to the goldfish?" exclaimed Beichuan. "Don't die again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun has another elder?"
He is very kind, kind, and helpful, and he always likes to have fun with his friends.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that a person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, a misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor, a misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor.
"On my knees, I beg you not to mention the word 'elder,' for I have a shadow in my heart."
Four years ago, he broke his word against a beautiful 'elder brother', who had been so miserable... that he had been so miserable for a whole year and four months. You have heard it right, a whole year and four months!
This is the first time in three seasons that the show has been shown to have a funny, funny, funny, funny, funny look.
There were eight people in the group who showed online status, six of whom showed a row of smiles in unison.
"You gloat fellows, this seat remembers each of you, do not let this seat meet you, or you will have to taste the sword of this seat 72!"
It's just the end of the world.
He was able to make it to the top of the ladder, but was unable to make it to the top of the ladder.
He is very fast and fast, but he is not able to shoot.
He is afraid of himself when he goes mad, but he can't hit A7!
When the crowd saw the three waves withered, it was another series of unscrupulous smiles.
"This time, we're just going to have to do a little bit of heavy lifting.
The group was in a state of turmoil for a long time, but they did not see the new group speak, and some were confused.
"What's the New York Times?" asked the New York Times.
Due to the effects of the cold medicine, Song has fallen asleep again.
At this point, Su was very happy to send a message: "I saw that the new Daoist was called 'Shushan Pressure.'
In retrospect, the Confucian walkers were even better at hitting than the Buddhists, and not only were their mouths slapped, but their fists were hard enough, and when they hit the right spot, they would go out of their way to make it even better!
"'한끼줍쇼' 이준호, '한끼성공' 한끼성공 ', 한끼성공 (종합)."
"Well, I'm sorry," he said.
"Is it going to be another 'big boss' who doesn't use chat tools?"
When he said that, did everyone feel that the scene was a sight to behold?
Yes, it seems that almost four years ago, there was also a senior who, after more than a hundred years of isolation, had just as easily gone to the chat software, and was joined by Huangshan Zhenjun, who, because he could not type, did not speak.
Then, one of the guys, who is called the Swordsman, is very happy in front of the old man and asks him to tell him about it, then asks him to send her a picture and then to talk about it.
And then... within a few days, three waves of madness saw the old man, a very beautiful old man, as beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
Then, the beautiful old man tossed his sword three times for a full year and four months before leaving with satisfaction.
At the same time, a "doctor" was appointed.
Unexplained short news, unending.
Well, the people in the group have become accustomed to the short chat habit of the pharmacist - he is asking the group leader where is the true gentleman of Huangshan Mountain?
Short speech is not a pharmacist's noble nature, but because he typed with two fingers and handwriting, and he was slow to steal, and it was easy to make mistakes when there were too many words, and it was painful to omit and write, so pharmacists are used to speaking short and short.
"He went down the line as soon as he added a person, and heard that the baby big dog of his family had left the house again in anger, and Huangshan Zhen went after him again."
"Pharmacist."
"That's the way it is," he said.
They are also considered to be new members of the same group.
About an hour later, the song was released.
"Do you remember someone just added me to the group, as if they were calling the Jiuzhou No. 1 group?" he murmured in a low voice, tapping the chat tool in the lower right corner and pulling out the chat window of the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.
What is it?
Soon after, a chat transcript from an hour earlier appeared in front of him.
It was all over again.
Chasing the Devil Dog?
A list of words in Sanskrit.
The way the people in the group talk and speak is also very interesting - half-ancient, half-white; it gives the impression that modern people try to communicate in ancient languages, and because of the lack of proficiency in ancient languages, the way of communication is awkward.
"Sing Sing Sing Sing."
Does it look like it was built by a fanatic?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary fairytale fan!
Each member of the group gave himself a name, and the place where he lived was called Dongfu, and all the dogs whose owners had gone missing were described as running away from home; and there was someone who claimed to have not fought a Confucian for a hundred years, that is, to have lived for hundreds of years?
It's a shame to look at these chats.
"This obsession has reached the level of the second disease, and it is a very Chinese character of the second fairy." Song Shuhang nodded in secret.
This is a concentration camp for the second-in-command!
This was his first impression of the 'Nine Islands Group 1' and its members.
But why add him?
It is revealed that he is not a member of the group, and that he does not know who he is.
The thin lines of blue extend smoothly from below the tip of the pen, and the light blue lines on the large card with the palm of the hand grow and gradually, a complex pattern becomes more and more perfect as the tip of the pen slides.
It was then that he saw the light of day, and he saw the light of day, and he saw the light of day, and he saw the light of day, and he saw the light of day, and saw the light of day.
His face is still as focused as ever, and he has only completed 15 cards now, 10 cards short of the task of today, and he is now working on a one-star energy card, the lowest level of energy card, which is currently one of the most widely used and consumed.
At this point, the room suddenly became dark.
The meter shows the number one hundred. Unexpectedly, he runs out of energy, and it seems that today's task will be an extra one. Returning to his desk, Chen goes to work, and relies on this most paper-grade card for all his livelihood.
The room was small, less than 40 square metres, and contained a semi-old working table, which, in addition to being relatively clean, was full of piles of debris, also piled up in piles of old books and raw materials.
In this humble place, where Chen has lived for three years, there is no better place for a poor man like him to live than in a small room like this one, which the federal government has made available for the price of a hundred and fifty euros a month.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen finally finished the day's work - twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, counted them twice in a row, and made sure that the number was correct.
As soon as he entered the door, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted him, "Asher is here!"
He replied to the owner, an old man in his fifties who had left an indelible mark on him with fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of old-fashioned mirrors.
He took the bag out of his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five."
"Well," he said, "I'm not going to let you go, and I'm not going to let you go, and I'm not going to let you go."
Chen, who smiled but did not answer, knew that Hua's words were a joke: One Star Energy Card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards, not to mention the fact that it is located near Dongyue University, where only 25 energy cards can be sold a day.
Knowing Chen's temper, he asked, "Do you need cash or money?"
After a brief pause, he returns to his room, where he is greeted by a young man, who, after saying good-bye to him, leaves the room.
"Wait a minute," he said.
"Is there anything else I can do to help you?"
Uncle Hua took a piece of goose yellow paper out of his drawer, and looked at Chen with a smile: "I almost forgot something. This is a lesson card for a card-making course, which the dealer gave me yesterday when I bought it."
He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years, and if it had not been for him, he believed that the present life was also out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned how to make energy cards and sold them all over the place, but few people wanted to buy them, and no businesses were willing to buy them. The amount of 1-star energy cards needed was so large that merchants preferred to buy them in large quantities at once.
Fortunately, he meets Uncle Hua, who agrees to buy his Energy Card, but the price of each card is 103 ODI, two ODI less than the price of the Energy Card on the market.
Although the price of 103 Odi is lower than the price of 105, Chen feels surrounded by great joy: he sells all the energy cards in his hand, buys the cheapest food, and buys the rest of the energy card raw materials.
Since then, his life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards per day, which he did not interrupt for a single day.
That's three years, and in those three years, he only made one kind of card - a one-star energy card - and he spent all his time working out how to cut costs, in addition to making energy cards.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy cards was controlled by him at 95 audi, and he earned 8 audi per energy card, and his daily income stabilized at 200 audi, a figure he had not dared to imagine three years ago.
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 아이돌아온차트 1 위.." 어디인가요 "."
They tend to make lavish advertisements, such as the one on the certificate that says "the Tōyō Gakuin recognizes academic qualifications" or "the Tōyō Gakuin senior senior card maker speaks to the authorities," but what exactly is inside is clear.
It was not until last year that he understood what was going on, despite the fact that he had not given up on self-study for so many years, which was one of the most difficult things to learn.
For a youngster without the slightest foundation, learning to make his own cards, known for its obscurity and obscurity, will be even more difficult. But he has no doubts about his IQ, and he can learn to make one-star energy cards in a week's time, thanks to his memory.
Since then, he has set aside what was temporarily too ambitious for him and turned to basic theoretical learning, which he takes the time to learn every day, no matter how tiring his work.
After saying goodbye to his uncle, Chen walked south along a side street, and today is Saturday, and he has a job.
After about 20 minutes of walking across two streets, he came to a used card collection station.
He is also the owner of the station, where he works for three hours on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
His face is slightly dark, and his face is slightly dull.
When Chen came here to ask for a short job, he refused, and the station had been taken care of by one man since his father's time, and he had also been taken care of by himself.
However, when Chen told him that he did not want to work, Black finally agreed, and, of course, Chen was still paid, and he would usually pick out a few used cards to take away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen would pick out a few unused energy cards from these piles of waste, and Little Black would calculate a sum of money he would save each month, but he was a little curious about his reticence, so how did he know that there was still energy in the cards?
Since then, however, he has been smiling at her every time he sees her.
Chen crouched down and began to sort the piles of used cards. There were many kinds of cards, including energy cards, item cards, fake cards, and even some of the rarer ones, such as plant cards and animal cards, but all the cards here were useless. Chen had to sort the cards into categories.
The work proceeded quickly, and it was clear that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen turns his wrist and throws a card at the little black: "Now, this card will last for a while." This two-star energy card has at least half the energy left in it, and Chen wonders why the original owner of the card is so wasteful. The two-star energy card has a capacity of 1,000, which means that it has about 500 energy left in it.
When Black looks at the two-star energy card on his hand, his eyes are wide, and he runs to the energy meter, inserts the card in, and when he sees the number "523" on it, Black laughs at the same time.
After three years of making the cards, he developed his own understanding of the most common and lowest grade of the cards. There is no single way to make a one-star energy card.
These one-star energy cards, with their various structures, inspired Chen, who, thanks to some of his skills, managed to reduce the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five odds.But such good fortune does not come every day, and so far he has collected only twelve.
But today's luck seems to be good.
In the case of a star, the energy card is a new type of energy card that has never been seen before.
He sets the energy cards aside and continues to scavenge. The number of energy cards on a star is too many, but Chen goes through them all the time. His speed is so fast that he can almost tell if he wants them by gently stroking them with his hand.
All this is due to his familiarity with the energy cards of a star, which he left behind after three years of uninterrupted production, so familiar that he can tell, without looking at them, whether the card is a star energy card or a structure he has seen, so familiar with them that he knows every detail of them.
The fingers that had passed over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
He got up from the bed.
Her head was swollen as if it were not her own, and the sumptuous sheets touched by the palms of her hands were not the old ones she used to wash her hair, and the lamps on her head were not the same as the half-broken energy-saving lamps she used to see, and her body was in pain as if it had just been torn off.
She covered her mouth and did not want her voice to come out, she opened the quilt and saw that there was no trace of herself inside, and the scream almost came out of her voice.
Then he went to the door, opened it, opened it, and went out into the street.
"Let go of me, let go of me, let go of me..."
The man's big hand grasped her neck and, with no effort, dragged her directly back to bed.
His deep eyes, like those of a born haughty, frosty cheek, and pen-winged, white, jade-like skin, made this woman, who asked herself well, envy and envy.
She had seen a lot of men, but the men, who were called gods, fell into obscurity before her.
Is it this man who spent half a night yesterday, half dead?
"Who sent you to give me medicine? Do you think you can get out of here intact?" he looked at the stunned woman, his deep eyes flashing with anger.
This strange woman, whose skin is better than snow, has a pleasant face, a pair of large, moving eyes, her eyelashes flickering like a frightened fawn, and her weak, wide-open eyes are staring at him.
As she looks at him, she sees that his eyes are again moving with her brain.
However, she is mistaken.
It is the first time that a star has been seen, but it is not the first time that a star has been seen.
This time, she was again grabbed by his rude arm, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in a panic before settling down again.
The pain in her hip, the pain in her hands, and the pain beneath her were too much to ignore, and when she got angry, she cried out, "What I want is someone else, I don't have a half-dollar relationship with you, you think you deserve my medicine, my mother-in-law doesn't do it, you pay for my medicine!"
The Wrong Man?
The eyes are black, the eyes are white, the eyes are black, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white, the eyes are white.
The pictures of the night flashed in his mind again, and he felt a sudden heat in his stomach and again felt the obvious heat welling up in his body.
The look on her face was gone.
This damned woman, who dared to give him medicine, was so strong.
When he finally got the chance, he jumped out of bed and pushed the man away.
Unable to return, she ran out of the room.
When she heard him hissing, she exclaimed, "Look, look at yourself!"
"You..." Gu Jing Ze tried to grab her, but she felt a bit of a strain in her body, and it was uncontrollable again.
"Damn it," he yelled, clenching his fists to suppress the damn * *.
There was a knock at the door.
Chin Hao looked back and was surprised that his mouth could not be closed.
What was the matter? Why did you run out of Mr.'s room to find a woman who was not dressed properly?
He raised his sharp eyes, and his black eyes flashed, causing Qin Hao to quickly put all his doubts into his stomach.
Gu Jingze had been washing his body in the bathroom, until the skin had been washed pink, and then scolded the mirror, "* * * *."
In the meantime, the mother comes to know that it will not be a good thing.
As the bathroom door opens, a handsome lady stands outside, looking at the bed in surprise.
The beds, which had not yet been picked up, were clearly telling everyone in front of them what had happened the previous night.
"I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm busy today."
"I don't know," she said, "but I don't know," and she said, "I don't know, I don't know."
Gu Jingze opened the door and said to Mu, "Don't you care about it?"
"I have to go," she said, "and I have to go."
"Mother, I'm not going to marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jing Ze is standing there, looking more upset than ever because of the woman's memory.
"Do you still think about that Mo Hui Ling, I tell you, you can't be with her, you can't be with her for so many years, you can't touch her, you're doomed!"
"Mother, it's enough!" says Gu Jingze, who wants to interrupt Mo.
But Mu was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can not touch a woman at all, the family is almost ready for artificial conception to get you a child, but you touched a woman today, she is the best person for you!"
The village is known for its rich history, and many of its inhabitants are known to have lived in this area since ancient times, when it was known as the "Old Town."
There are many myths, legends, and myths, and a thick cloud covers the city with a mysterious veil.
On the morning of the third day, when the sun was setting, a large crowd of people gathered in front of the house, holding three long incense sticks, walked quietly and quickly along the path toward the back of the mountain.
The mountains are steep and the dew is slippery, but the Taoists run over the horses with the blue shadows, and from time to time the Taoists leap over the wind for over a hundred metres, and the morning breeze blows, and their clothes dance, and they float like gods.
In the mountains, mountains, and mountains of the same name, there is an unnamed mountain.
Among them were large groups of small Taoists with banners and implements of various colors, carrying incense burners and walking around the nine palaces; cigarettes went up into the air, wrapped up in the air, and became a cloud over the path.
At the front of many Taoists, just below the stone wall, a group of Taoists dressed in a purple robe with a silver thread embroidered on the back of their chests, and the edges of the sleeves of the robe have a pattern of clouds and flowers, and the gorgeous Taoists below the body are holding the dust and standing there expressionless.
When a red light suddenly rose from the east, and a red light burst from the sky and spread over the four quarters, many Taoist worshipers bowed down together and performed the three kneeling and nine clapping ceremonies on the stone wall.
Thousands of people were chanting the mantra at the same time, and the sound of the 'buzzing buzzing' mantra was tangled together and sent forth as a small, trembling sound. Gradually, a strange power rose from the sound of the mantra, and a brilliant, colorful glow came from the top of the heads of many of them, shining on the smooth, smooth stone wall.
The Taoists, dressed in the purple robes of Phnom Penh, bowing to the ground, murmured a prayer in their mouths.
After about half an hour, a ray of white light was emitted from the top of the wall, and soon the entire wall was illuminated.
The smoke rose up, the walls were covered with countless clouds of smoke, and a number of figures dimly lit by golden lights appeared in the clouds; the figures became increasingly clear, and eventually three men, two women, and five women, dressed in white robes, appeared in front of the crowd, their faces obscured by the golden light.
The woman in the middle looked down at the many Taoist men kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had a scroll in her hand, which she threw out.
The white light flashed on the stone wall, and the purple jade slowly floated out of the scroll, which was woven of gold thread, and fell on the hands of the purple robe that led many worshipers in the foreground.
Several old purple robes burst out shouting: "Lord be merciful, be merciful!"
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 5 년만에 5 개월만에한끼성공 (종합)."
The woman who threw the scroll was cold, and all of a sudden all the Tao people fell to the ground with stiffness, and did not dare to make any more sound.
There was a pause, and then the door opened, and a voice came out.
The walls were dark, and the five men disappeared.
A few things that sparkle with strange light slowly fall from the sky: a sword, a bead, a tripod, five amulets, and nine vials.
Swords, beads, and small balls are like children's toys, but each one is dazzling and smoky, and is clearly extraordinary.
The five lambs are more closely intertwined with each other, and if there is a wave of pressure flowing from the lambs, those who are closer to the lambs become unstable, and they are pushed back by this force.
The nine vials of medicine were densely carved with various marks and seals, and the old way who had just taken the scroll opened one of the vials in the presence of many Taoist people, and a quiet vial of medicine sprang out at once, and thousands of people in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, and felt that the seven organs were smooth, and the veins were as if they had been washed by water, and the whole body was open.
The mere smell of a lump of medicine is enough to overcome the three months of drunkenness of these Taoists. The purple robes of the Taoists are so busy sealing the bottle tightly that the scent of the medicine alone has such a miraculous effect that one can only imagine the treasures of the medicine in the bottle.
Several old purple robes were gathered together and whispered for a while, and the scrolls were opened in front of the people by gathering up swords, beads, dings, amulets, and medicine bottles.
In the first half of the scroll, there is a scripture for the reformation of the spirit, the Sutra of the Great Void, and in the second half of the scroll, the faces of the elders of the purple robes are discolored, and they shout in dismay. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists come out of the Qingcheng Mountain.
In the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains of the mountains.
Chapter 1
In the heat of July, under the scorching heat of the sun, the asphalt road exudes a pungent smell of paint, which seems to be a quick fix.
The surface of the road is distorted due to the evaporating air.
Under such a poisonous sun, there are hardly any pedestrians on the street, not even cars, and everyone is either looking for a cool place to escape the heat or enjoying themselves in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a washed-out plastic-colored white shirt and floppy blouse was hurrying straight towards the Second People & apos; s Hospital.
The woman's hair clings tightly to the woman's face because of the sweat, and the woman's cheeks are unusually flushed, apparently exposed to the sun.
The white shirt was wet with sweat, and it felt uncomfortable to be wrapped in it, but Jo Nan did not have time to take care of it, and the bag of 100,000 dollars was clutched.
This is the amount of money that she has to sell all the valuable things around her, and her sister has to pay 200,000 for surgery, and she has to find another way.
As he walks straight to the room, Jo's hand touches the door and he hears the conversation between the mother and daughter in the room.
"Mom, it's all Chao Nan's fault, and if it weren't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me." That was the voice of Chao Nan's sister Chao Nan.
"Don't cry, my mother has already taught you a lesson." The mother touched her eldest daughter's head with pain.
In the end, it is revealed that she is not the only one who has been arrested, but that she is the only one who has been arrested, and that she is the only one who has been arrested.
At the end of the war, Chen was in a state of shock.
He was the son of a wealthy man, but his father was a poor man, and his mother was a poor woman, and his father was a poor man, and his mother was a poor woman, and his father was a poor man.
In the end, Cho Nan was forced to withdraw, leaving Chen and his sister behind.
"Mother, the army has divorced me, the child is not by my side, I have this disease, what should I do? Mother, I do not want to die, I have not filial piety to you, I really do not want to die."
At the end of the series, she is shown to be very young and has a good life, but she doesn't really want to die.
When he learns that his daughter is so sick that he wants to take care of her, he decides to take care of her.
"No," she said, "I will not let you go, and I will not let you go."
Shortly after his divorce from Chen Jun, he developed kidney failure and had to change his kidneys.
However, in this marriage, Joe's collar was wrongly wronged, and Chen's army was also working for the government, and Joe's collar was washed out of the house, and now he is sick and does not have enough money to pay for medicine.
After hearing the news of his mother's death, he was unable to stop his anger.
She is 40 years old, and after she broke up with Chen, she never fell in love again, not wanting to talk to her mother.
Most of the money she earned over the years was given to her mother, who used it to buy her sister a suite of 150 square feet, which she could only sleep in in a rented room of only a few dozen.
Her parents paid for her meals and even her utilities, and her sister returned home every time, although she carried some things in her hand when she came back, she carried more when she came back.
It is revealed that she is not married, and that her mother is not married, but only wants her salary.
Her mother, however, is in love with her, and every time she falls in love with her, her mother dies.
In the end, the three of them are forced to leave the house, and in the end, the three of them are forced to leave the house, only to find that they have lost a thousand pounds, and that they have no choice but to leave the house.
Not long after this, a conversation between the two men begins, which turns out to be a real disappointment for Joe.
What if Chao Nan raised 200,000 dollars and couldn't find * * a kidney? The doctor said that if a relative would donate a kidney to me, the match would be higher and the rejection would be less likely. "
"Well," he said, "if I were to say it, I would say it would be better."
* * Some people do not have the chance to wait until they die!
Knowing this, Joey realizes that she doesn't have enough money to live, and that she has to do something else.
"Do you want me to check your blood?" she asked.
She shook her head, her mother was old, her kidneys were certainly no better than her, she was sure to be a good woman, if it was all, "Mom, you are my mother, I don't want you to move the knife, my father certainly can not."
"I'm sorry," she said, "I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to go to the hospital, and I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
"Good is good, but Qiao Nan will not agree, after all, it is a kidney."
In order to survive, just in case, she will never let Jo Nan refuse.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공 '한끼성공'."
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 소녀시대에도전..." (in Korean).
When they arrive at the house, they see the back of a young man and call out his name.
When he hears Dingjiayi's cry, he refuses to turn back or stop, tears fall down his face, and his heart is broken.
For her mother, her sister, she does not even have a home of her own, but for her mother and her sister, who have not counted enough money for her, still wants her kidney.
The more he tries, the more he hates her, and the more he hates her, and the more he hates her, the more he hates her.
In the middle of the street, a car rushes at her, telling her that it is dangerous.
"Squeeze," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang," "bang."
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened, and when she saw her daughter lying in the blood, she ran up to her, and then murmured, "You, Jo Nan, it's okay if you die, at least you can help your sister when you die.
The young girl is killed, and the man who killed the young girl must lose money.
When he heard Ding Jiayi's words, he stared at Ding Jiayi with his eyes fixed on him, and he could not bear to be killed by Ding Jiayi before the rescue personnel arrived.
Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that you fantasize about heaven at the first moment and find yourself in hell at the next moment.
One of the students, who was sitting in a classroom two months earlier, fantasized about getting into a major university, while he was working on a construction site in the sun.
Remembering what had happened to him, he spat on the ground, lifted his hands, and rubbed his face with the sweat that was constantly dripping from his face.
A seventeen-year-old boy with an ordinary face, dark skin, a thin figure, and a pair of slightly calm eyes, perhaps a child from a poor family who had become the head of the household, and a young man who looked like a teenager.
The cement truck with the bricks in its hand dropped to the side of the road and sat down in a shady place, when the foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy, and it would be happy to be lazy for a while on a dry and busy construction site.
He sat down on a concrete slab with a bayonet and kept his eyes on the road, his eyes lighting up in a moment; a handsome figure came out across the road and immediately caught his attention.
Despite the distance and the fact that they cannot see each other, the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don & apos; t look only at the woman walking, but there is a lot of learning inside, and the question is to stay on the construction site, across the road and the sidewalk.
He seemed to recall pulling a blue metal disc from his chest, the size of a coin, tied with a small chain of blue, like a strange necklace.
It was also discovered by accident a few days before the demolition of an old house, when he found an old green brick in a wall, which was potholed and dilapidated, and was estimated to be 100 years old.
For example, if you are a hundred-year-old antique, you may be worth a little money, but if you are a green brick, you may not be worth anything.
It is said that he threw the green brick on the ground, but did not want to break it, and dropped a metal ornament from the inside, which was a strange necklace in his hand.
The cyan metal disc was a bit strange, dividing the disc into eight sections, with various strange runes carved on them.
It is not uncommon to see people who are not familiar with the subject, but it is common to see people who are not familiar with the subject, and to see people who are not familiar with the subject, to see that the subject is a small version of a Bagua dish, which is usually hung in the house to avoid bad luck.
Although he is not a superstitious person and does not believe in the power of the Baguban, he knows that the Baguban should be priceless, and that it may be an antique, and if sold to an antique dealer, it may be rich overnight.
His eyes are full of longing, stroking his gossip necklace is like stroking his lover, and once he is rich, the beautiful women who once dared only to peep at him and swallow his mouth in the dark are not at his disposal.
"Something's wrong, something's wrong!"
"Something's wrong! Call an ambulance."
A loud shout was heard from a distance, followed by many people running to the place, and the shout interrupted the dream.
He looked at the other side, hesitated, got up, and ran to where the crowd was gathered.
A middle-aged man, nearly fifty years old, dressed in rags, lay on the ground, twitching, pale and breathing with his hands on his chest, seemingly in pain.
His eyes were filled with deep fear, and he seemed to feel death.
Many of the workers came, but no one dared to step forward, and a group of workers with little education apparently did not know what was happening and did not dare to take action.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
He looked at the twitching old Zhang on the ground, who recognized at a glance that there had been an acute myocardial infarction in the village and who had died within a few minutes, and who had witnessed it.
The village is very remote, there is no professional doctor in the village, and all the illnesses that occur in the village are treated with simple earthworks that have been passed down from ancestors, and there is no specific treatment at all.
His mother, who was sickly and labored, had no doctor in the village, and his greatest dream was to enter the country's most famous medical university, where he would become a doctor for his mother and villagers.
He was able to obtain a degree in medicine from the University of Michigan, but was unable to obtain a degree in medicine, so he was forced to leave the University of Michigan to pursue a career in medicine.
Although he was able to gain admission to other good schools based on his grades, the high tuition fees were beyond his means, and he had to give up his studies and start earning money in order not to burden his mother.
The site belongs to a development zone on the outskirts of the city, far from the city, and the nearest hospital ambulance takes 25 minutes to reach it.
He is known to have lived in the same cottage as him, and is known by the common name of "Chang," who is a good-natured and good-natured man who does not have any special skills, and who works at the lowest level of the worksite.
He is said to have had a son who went to college, and to have worked so hard to make money for his son to go to college.
He has a dream of becoming a doctor, and has some knowledge of simple and common pathologies, but he knows that there are several emergency measures for acute myocardial infarction that can alleviate the condition.
It is a good thing to be able to save nature, but if it is not a good thing, the patient has a long and short life, and the responsibility is likely to be held in his head.
This is the reality of a neo-Nazi society, which may simply take emergency measures to ease the illness and prolong the time it takes to die to save a life, but, like everyone else around it, does not dare to come forward to help.
He takes a deep breath, and after a brief silence, he finally sighs and walks towards the sick old Zhang, who is not a bad guy, but has a good relationship with him, who are poor rural people who come out to work and understand each other's hardships, and who is the mainstay of the whole family.
"Don't move him, I'm a doctor."
A beautiful figure came running from a distance, passing through a lot of messy construction sites, to a small place where the incident occurred.
There was a long pause, and then, with a sigh of relief, the door opened, and he entered.
It was a girl, handsome and tall, only half a head shorter than Mo, with a white frilly dress and a skirt that fell at the bend of her legs, revealing a pair of slender, white legs.
It was the first time he had ever seen such a beautiful girl!!!!!!!!
He found out that the girl in the white dress was the same woman who had been lying on the other side of the street, and who had been secretly having sex with someone who was not only physically fit, but also had an amazingly beautiful face.
The girl squats down to check on the old Chang's condition, and soon the beautiful face changes, as if the situation is a bit serious.
It is also known that the patient suffered from shock at this time, and the situation is not very optimistic.
"Can you help me?"
The girl looked up at him with impatience and asked him if he was the closest person to the patient.
"Yes!"
The girl asks him if he can help her, but he doesn't seem to be able to help her.
"Can you help me level his body and raise his legs slightly?" the girl asks Mo as she carefully compresses his chest.
He knew that the girl was right, and that lifting the patient's legs in order to prevent hypoxia in the brain of the person suffering from the shock was the best solution in the absence of equipment such as oxygen tanks.
He suddenly found that his chest was getting hotter and hotter, as if a burning piece of iron had stuck to his chest, and he changed his face and subconsciously touched his chest to discover that it was the baguette that had been unearthed from the ancient cyan brick.
Anlin stood at the top of the tower, facing the wind.
The wind whistled, and the sense of weightlessness of a precipitous fall, and even though he was no longer in love, he was terrified and screamed. "Save your life!"
The fear of impending death enveloped him and made every part of his body tremble.
At this point, the entire body of Anlin is suddenly covered with a mysterious white cloud.
A terrible feeling of overweight came at this moment, and he felt as if he were riding a roller coaster, rushed to the bottom, then circled an arc and flew into the sky.
Anlin's scream continued, his body flying into the sky and falling back on the roof of the building.
The intense weight loss, as well as the feeling of life and death, made Anlin feel dizzy and then vomited out.
"Hey, boy, are you all right?" Just then, an ethereal voice comes to Anlin's ear.
He looks up and finds an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man has white hair, and the whole body is covered with golden hair, and he looks like a holy man.
At the end of the episode, Annie is awakened by a series of flashbacks.
The story begins in Anlin's mind, and isn't that the beginning of all the fantasy?
Putong!
"Thank you, fairy, for saving me!"
The old man, who had been called a fairy by Anlin, stroking his white beard, smiled and said, "Young man, you are in a good old age, why do you choose to be light?"
"My mother died young, and my father gambled." "After my father gambled on the house, he owed several million more to gamble than he could repay, and then he ran alone!"
"Millions! What shall I give back?"
"Then I was forced to drop out of school to work for my creditors."
Anlin pours out her nose in tears, feeling that her life is a bleak one. A life in which she has paid off her debt all her life is no different from that of a saltwater fish.
"Well, young man," he said slowly, "your life is so hard... well, you and I are bound to meet each other, and I think you have the best qualities, so let Benson send you a 'system' that will change your life."
He thought that he would be able to make a fortune with the Fairy, but he did not expect the Fairy to be so rich that he sent the system as soon as he met him.
"I don't know," he said, "but I don't know what to do."
In the middle of the sky there is a white light, and in the middle of the sky there is a white light, and in the middle of it there is a light.
"Come, young man, hold this ball of light in your hand," the fairy said to Anlin.
As a result, Anlin is agitated and can't wait to grab the ball of light.
In his hands, the ball radiates a warm stream of silk, and the light that shines in the ball is softer than ever.
"I'm sorry," the man said.
Just the Words of a Fairy, the Light on the White Globe Shines!
Just then, the Fairy said to Anlin, "Young man, swear to accept this system of gods of war, and never give up!"
God of War System?
What a name!
But how does this vow resemble a declaration of marriage?
"I swear," he said, "that I will accept the system of the gods of war, and that I will never give up!"
As he is about to leave, he hears a knock on the door, knocking on the door and knocking on it.
Then a voice came to his mind: "Detect the host as a nymph, qualify, and the system begins to merge!"
Annie is excited and wants to cry.
I thought my life was going to be dark, but I didn't think it was going to be a turning point, and now I have a life with an open system!
The fairy was also excited, and so excited that she cried!
"What's wrong with you, Grandpa Fairy, is it all right?"
The wizard returns, wipes his tears, and knows that he has lost his form.
"Young man, when you get the system, you have to cheer up," said the fairy.
"Yes, I will!" he yelled.
"So, do you want to go to school to practice magic?" the wizard asked.
To go to school?
"Oh, I want to be a monk!"
He smiled, took out a golden sheet of paper, and said, "This is my letter of commendation, and with it you can go to Shu Xian United University to study, and officially embark on the path of Shu Xian."
Anlin is shocked to see that the dragon is proud of its path, and all the fairies have paved it for themselves!
He received a letter of commendation from the Fairy and looked at the Fairy with gratitude.
Annie is surprised to learn that she has given birth to a baby boy.
"That's the name... or don't say it." The fairy patted Anrin on the head, with a sympathetic look on her face.
"I have to go," he said.
They bid him farewell, and then they go into the forest.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공 '한끼성공' (종합)."
In the sky, there is the laughter of the fairies, the laughter of the fairies, the laughter of the fairies, as if they had poured out the unhappiness of their lives.
Why is this fairy so happy? How can I be happier than I am?
"I don't know.
Just then, a woman's voice sounded in Anlin's consciousness: "Hello."
The sound of the woman's voice is beautiful, like the sound of heaven, and the whole body of Angrin is witty.
Is that the voice of the system?
Annie hesitates.
At the same time, there was an interplay in Anlin's mind.
The interface is gray, with only a few words on it: The Ares system's functionality will be activated after entering the Atlantean continent.
What Happened to the Continent?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation from the fairy, and spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
He then discovered that there was nothing in the gold paper but a slightly recessed mudra.
It is not clear whether Anlin was aware of this, but he did so by placing his hand on the paper, which coincided with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper was full of gold, and Anlin was surprised to hear a "yell" and was completely engulfed by the gold.
Anlin only feels a whirl of the sky, and the field of vision becomes dark and bright again.
He then finds his body again at high altitude and begins to land freely.
Once again, Anlin experienced the feeling of jumping out of a building, which was so sour that he wanted to shed tears no matter how many times he came.
Anlin looks up at him with some difficulty, and then sees a scene that makes him immortal.
Two tall, white-tipped dragon posts, standing between the horizon, are inscribed on a plaque that he does not understand.
After the gate, the palace was in the millions, with no end in sight.
The sky is filled with clouds, and the sky is filled with clouds, and the sky is filled with clouds.
Annie is standing in the middle of the room, stunned.
This World Is Really Wonderland!
Annie tries to calm down and calm herself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a robe coming up to greet him.
"Hello, fairy sister." Anlin beckons to the woman.
The beautiful woman sees Annie beckoning to her and walks away.
"I don't know," she said, "but I don't know what you mean by that."
Upon hearing Anlin's words, the woman looked odd, and then said, "Kylie Gollum?"
"What are you talking about?" he asked.
The woman, with the same expression on her face as Anlin, opened her mouth and said, "Jiri Guruwah?"
At this moment, a terrible conjecture appears in his mind.
"Do you know how to speak English?," she said.
"'한끼줍쇼' 강호동, 한끼성공... '한끼성공', 한끼성공."
No, I don't understand the language.
What the hell is she talking about? I don't understand it at all!
In the end, Annie cries.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On one platform, hundreds of people screamed and cheered, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most remarkable place is the two cars that are about to start.
The Ferrari 488 was the most expensive, with a cost of over 4 million euros, and the Ford Mustang was the cheapest, with a cost of half a million euros.
This is a list of the most recent and most recent episodes of the New York Times and New York Times.
At the Ford Mustang, Zhang is silently leaning on the door, his clothes are sloppy, his hair is long, Liu Haier's eyes are closed when he looks down, his closed eyes are not visible, his cheeks are cut from the lower part of his mouth, and he can see the unique beauty of Zhang Dao, but now the temperament is full of decadence.
And Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, looks like the stars in the moon, as if he were saying that the world is under his feet.
"Let's go," he said.
He waved his hand and walked away with a smile on his face.
"What is it?"
"Are you asleep?" he asked. "Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
"He's like this now, I think he's a poor beggar!"
"No, I don't think he's as good as begging for food," he said.
On the side of the Ford Mustang stands a man with thick glasses and a little girl of three or four years of age on his leg.
The little girl is dressed in a white dress, and her delicate face is like a lovely princess in a fairy tale, except that her hair is a little messy and everything is perfect, but the tears of grievance are contained in the big eyes of the little girl, listening to the number of people who have fallen to Zhang Han, she seems to be crying.
It is often assumed that the little girl's cute appearance attracts a lot of attention, but now it is time for Liu Feng to perform alone.
There was a knock at the door.
When he opens his eyes, he sees people's behavior in front of him, and his eyes are full of contempt for the world.
"Can an ant bark in front of a Buddha?."
There was a knock at the door.
The whole place was quiet, but at the next moment, a sarcastic laugh rang out.
"What do you think you're doing?"
"It's not going to be easy."
Once again, the people mocked him, but when Zhang saw the picture, he was stunned.
"Isn't it time I raced at Wolverine Mountain and Liu Feng in 2009?"
"How can I be here?"
"Am I not robbing the world?"
"Have I come back?"
"I was born again by the thunder of the Nine Heavens?"
According to Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, Zhang's family was one of the eight major families in Shangjing, and Zhang's father was the owner of the house at that time, so Zhang was not afraid of him, but once when his family was on a plane trip, he was hit by a plane crash halfway, his parents and his sister were killed, and his uncle Zhang Ming was the owner of the house, but he could not prevent the desolation of Zhang's family.
It is revealed that he is the one who killed his father, and that he is the one who killed his father, and that he is the one who killed his father, and that he is the one who killed his father.
It was five years ago, and Zhang refused to leave, always trying to find out what was going on, but the days were tough, but always holding out until this wolf-walking mountain incident.
In the beginning of the series, he is shown to have been in a car accident in which he was seriously injured, lost his arms, and was finally able to jump off a cliff for five years, but he did not expect to be in the real world.
With the help of this supernatural power, for five hundred years, Zhang Han, with all kinds of treasures, will be repaired to the utmost.
"Why not five years ago?"
There was a pause.
It is said that he did not know the truth of the matter, and that he did not know the truth of the matter, and that he did not know the truth of the matter, nor did he know the truth of the matter, nor did he know the truth of the matter.
As a result of this, he was able to gain the respect of his parents, even though he was no longer in love with them.
The tree wants to be quiet and windy, and the child does not want to be cared for.
"Zhang Han!"
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, looked up, and saw Liu Feng looking at himself with a cold look in his eyes.
"Five years ago you kicked me out of the city!
Today, five years later, I am Liu Feng, the car owner of Los Angeles, coming back forcefully, and you, Zhang Han, are no better than a living dog! Remember, today I Liu Summit let you, Zhang Han, walk out of Beijing! "
"Oh, I don't know," he said, "I don't know."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the Ferrari's car key in his hand and said, "As long as you win me, this car is yours."
He opened his eyes.
"Oh, yes.
With a sneer, Liu raised his hand and said, "Raise the screen!"
At the same time, remotely piloted aircraft were raised all over the mountain, and the screens were opened and the cameras from each of the remotely piloted aircraft were transmitted back to show the entire course of the mountain.
"Ready to get started!"
Liu Feng nodded to the back of the Ford Mustang and sat in the Ferrari.
Daddy, Come on, Beat the Bad Guys
"How do you know that?"
He shook his head.
"Hanko, you can win!"
The Fat Man clasps his fist to Zhang Han and gives him a look of encouragement.
"By your good advice, your car will bring me good luck."
He looked up at her and saw her sitting in the car.
"Get ready!"
The engines of both cars roared in anger at the same time.
At the end of the episode, Lou has a smile on his face.
There was a knock on the door.
His eyes were full of fear and anxiety, and his eyes were full of tears.
In the middle of the car, there is a smile on his face.
"Do you want me to be complicit?"
"Alas, I am not what I was then." "Even if nothing is done now, how can an ant provoke?"
CHAPTER I
Rust Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Facility No. 23.
It is also known as the "Great Grave."
With the development of the true civilization, the magic that was once high and could only be driven by the true person came into many households, and became a necessary tool for ordinary people to travel and study at home.
As a result, there is a large amount of waste and scrap metal.
Most of these materials are highly radioactive and can cause severe damage to the environment if left untreated.
As a result, several "special waste disposal sites" have been set up around every major city in the Commonwealth to deal with scrap metal.
No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Plant, located in the southern suburb of the federal cultivation town of Fugo.
Under the yellow sky, a polluted purple swamp gives off a foul smell, a mountain of metal fragments like a hundred dinosaurs protruding from the swamp, a mountain full of broken swords, a rusty hedgehog puppet sitting next to the sword, an empty eye socket already extinguished, and only the eunuchs that feed on the spirit protrude their heads from it, carefully surveying the perilous "Phabol Cemetery."
"Boom!"
As a result, many of the metal components, such as celestial maidens, were scattered and splashed, causing the chain of several garbage mountains around them to collapse, raising the smoke of the sky, like a demon dancing and covering the entire sky.
It seems to be a forbidden zone of life, with only a handful of cockroaches and worms turning it into a paradise.
Li Yao lurched behind a junkyard, licking his cracked lips, and his khaki-yellow windbreaker was covered in dust, blending him with the environment.
At the end of the video, the young man is shown to be in a state of shock, not knowing what to do.
It was only when the earth and metal fragments spattered into the garbage heap where he was hiding that he shrunk slightly into the depths of the heap, while wearing a goggle that covered half of his face.
"Come on!"
At 3: 52: 38 p.m., the daily routine of dumping rubbish is also the time for Li Yao's "rubbish bug" carnival!
His left wrist watch, which he wore, was a special model for hunting that was introduced three years ago by the Buddhist monk Fei-Ling Zong, and it took him two months to repair it after it was picked up in the rubbish mountain.
In addition to timing, it has a very powerful function to record vibrations of a particular frequency, notifying the owner when a specific vibration is heard nearby.
This function was originally intended to warn hunters of the presence of powerful beasts near them.
As a result, he was forced to change his mind when he saw that the ship was approaching.
A few moments later, accompanied by a small buzz, a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke from the explosion did not disperse, and a dozen small black spots were mixed together, making it impossible to distinguish them.
Li Yao shrugged his nose and touched a rungram on the side of the goggle with his finger. The goggle was covered with blood red.
Under the red light scanning, the rubbish boat hidden behind the soot is clearly outlined.
The hunting function of the Ling Zi watch also locks in the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Trash ship 1327, that's you!"
From birth to the age of ten, Lee spent ten years in the tomb of Fa Po, where he knew every inch of land and every garbage boat in the sky, the "1327" which was responsible for collecting garbage in the "Upper East Side" of the city of Fogo.
The Upper East Side was the richest part of the city, inhabited by a large number of reformers, whose discarded treasures were the most valuable.
Many of the magic tricks are even intact, simply because they are a little bit outdated, or because a new generation of products has been introduced, and they have been disregarded by reformers and the rich.
For Lee, this is a garbage ship, a treasure ship full of gold!
"Sing."
Li Yao, with his feet on the ground, shot like a projectile, galloped across the junkyard, rushed towards the soot, towards the "1327"!
It is surrounded by a crumbling garbage mountain, with a poisonous swamp at the foot of which is a gurgling bubble, but Li Yao is like the most skillful monkey in the mountains, and from time to time he uses his strength to protrude somewhere on the garbage mountain, and every time he pedals, he can eject several tens of meters away, and the movement is flowing in the clouds and is pleasing to the eye.
"Lee Yao, you bastard, eat again with the old man!"
At this point, a dozen figures emerged from behind several garbage mountains, similar to Lee Yao's, but not as advanced as his blood-red goggles and wristwatches.
The men clutched shovel and iron bars in their hands and were menacing.
Like Li Yao, they are garbage worms that are fed by the "Special Waste Disposal Plant No. 23."
Where there is an interest, there is a struggle, and the abandonment of a ship's treasure may be garbage for those who are tall, but it is a hope of survival for the poor, and Li Yao is the best garbage worm in the grave of Fa Bao, and is naturally the eye nail of most of the garbage worm and stings in the flesh.
Li Yao, however, did not care, and with a smile, his waist suddenly became strong, and his body turned 90 degrees without any sign, and a fat boy with a big brow in front of him, and he took advantage of the situation and stepped on one foot on the fat face, and while he was on this foot, the whole person was robbed 30 or 40 meters.
"Fat Dragon, come out and eat, faster than anyone else, you should lose weight!"
There is a large red mark on the obese teenager's face, and his nose is about to sink into the fat meat, and he is very angry and screaming, directing his men to chase after him, and the party quickly enters the smoke area.
There was an explosion that just happened, and it was very unstable, and dozens of garbage mountains would collapse at any time, and even a group of ferocious fat dragons could not help but slow down and watch Li Yaofeng's electric power.
It does not have a spatula.
In the meantime, another explosion occurred inside a rubbish mountain not far from Lee Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken treasures were washed down like flash floods!
"That's the spirit!"
But there was a scream in the smoke: "Little black, save your life!"
A black-winged ray, deeper than the night sky, "drips" in a metal flash, and then "drips" in the middle of the sky, but a rusty blade, a notch in the blade, a black flying sword, with a huge guard like a black wing, Li Yao, like a drowning man, clumsily grabbing straw, clumsily lying on a flying sword, circling it, and rushing toward the sky!
In the sky, dozens of garbage boats have been revealed to be huge, each of which is several hundred meters long, and the rolling body is like a turtle that supports the earth in legend, and the "turtle shell" is densely engraved with thousands of runes, flashes of light, and colorful, helping these tens of thousands of tons of weight to resist the invasion of gravity.
"Uh-huh!"
The hatch of each "Great Turtle" opens, spewing out massive metal constructions and broken spells, hitting the ground hard.
For a moment, the spirit of the entire universe was stirred up, and a sea of tumult arose.
Even the tens of thousands of tons of rubbish ships were tossed about in the Spirit Wave, and had to be parted in a desperate effort to ease the disturbance.
It is not easy to get close to them, as they are afraid of being caught.
Li Yao, still riding a black sword, swooped in a wave of spiritual power, looking as if he were a loach.
He does not dare to confront the stormy waves, but he tries to find a relatively calm area between the spiritual tides based on his ten years of survival experience, just to get as close as possible to the point of falling garbage spells.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the ship thunders like a behemoth, turns around, lazily turns back, and the soot dissipates.
Fai Long climbs into the rubbish dump center and sees Li Yao sitting comfortably on a new rubbish mountain, smiling and squinting at him.
"Damn!"
The face is flattened and the heart is flattened.
The junkyard chosen by Lee was ingenious, not the largest junkyard, and did not look like the richest.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around the city, which contain valuable garbage treasures.
If he were to continue to be entangled with Li Yao, he would be profited by other scavenger hunters.
There was a large crowd of people in the area, and there was a lot of shouting and shouting in the streets, which was a good thing.
Fei-long heard that Li Yao was a stinky boy who was also a student at Fugo Town's famous "Second High School Attached to the School of Che Xiao."
It is one of the largest and most powerful organizations in the Southern United States, and is well known for its high standards and high standards.
Li Yao, though he may not have learned anything from the true story, would not have been able to deal with it alone for more than a decade in the tomb of Fa Bao, and would still be alive and well, fighting the "vulture"!
But where is his face?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh; his heart is in a tangle, a strong wind passes by, and the fat dragon reaches out his hand to copy it, and it becomes cold, but it is a fist-sized broken crystal brain.
"Well, I have just found a blue-green dragon 17, the most advanced model, which can calculate more than five thousand thoughts per second, and although it is burned, I estimate that it will be sold for three or four thousand pieces, and when I honor your big brother, and we will fight, how?"
"You..." Fat Long did not expect that Li Yao would come, and was suddenly stunned, and some could not believe it scratched the fat on his face.
"Well, look over there, the wild wolves are coming, they are not like me, they will definitely wipe off dozens of garbage mountains, not even a screw will be left for you!"
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, hurry up!"
A group of rubbish worms scatter and rush towards the rubbish mountains on all sides.
Li Yaochang breathed a sigh of relief, sat down in the rubbish heap, rolled down a bean-sized sweat ball on his forehead, and a smiling face burst into tears.
"'내친구의집은어디인가' 소녀시대, 아이돌아온다!."
"Do you know what I mean by 'The Wolf'?."
One day you will be asked to spit out what I have eaten and return it to me, with interest and usury, so that you may know why everyone calls me 'a vulture who does not want money!' "
"No, we have to speed it up, the Wolf Gang is a mess, but it doesn't make any more sense than a fat dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm saving people, not suicide!"
"Don't deceive your mother, you can't even have a dog, and save people? Besides, there's no one in the river!"
When he came down from the hill, he saw someone fall in the river near the village, jumped down to save people, and after jumping down, he remembered that he could not water at all, and ironically, the person who fell was not a person, but an inflatable doll, and it was very hard.
"Is there anyone in the village who is so fashionable with this thing?!"
This is the last thought before he loses consciousness, and when he wakes up again, he lies on the Ondol next to his parents.
Then, less than a day later, the entire village learned that the idiot had contracted the mountain, and that the university student who had grown the herbs could not think of it, and jumped into the river to commit suicide.
"That child 80% went to school Biao, where did the famous college students go home to farm land?"
"Yes!"
"This medicine, I don't grow it!"
The father, who had always been squatting on the side of the smoking bag, exclaimed, "This is the face of the people in the village," and the old man listened to it, and the old man was troubled, and he planted it again, and he did not have any money to pay for it, and even his son did not get it.
"And now," he said, "this time, stop growing herbs, and let your sister go to the city to help you find a decent job, and the children of your Changmao uncle's house are just graduates of an unknown school, and they have found a job in the city, and now they are all buying a house there!"
After hearing this, Wang Yao stopped talking to his parents and nodded his head in agreement.
After graduating from a prestigious university, he returned to the mountain village, started his own business, contracted a desolate area of the village, and wanted to grow herbs to make his family rich, only to discover that the herbs were far less simple than he had imagined, that they could not be grown with a lot of blood, and that much of what was not in the books depended on practice and experience.
In the first year, the herbs he had grown were infected with insect disease, and the second year, the herbs bloomed and the leaves did not grow root, which was the third year.
But when he came to the mountain, he found that it was a desolate mountain, perhaps because of its soil, and that it did not grow much, but there were a dozen large chestnut trees, date trees, and a large slope on the mountain, and that there were several acres of medicinal fields that he had cultivated with his own efforts, and for this reason he had to pay money to build a hut on the mountain, and he had electricity to take care of these acres of medicinal fields, and in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Looking at a well-grown herb, he reached out and touched it.
Try again for another year?
"Herbs detected, trigger conditions met, system activated?"
A cold mechanical sound suddenly rang out.
"What voice, who?!"
There are mountains, water, and trees all around, but no one is there.
"It's a good thing," he said.
"Is the system activated?"
The sound of the machine sounded again, as if it were just a few steps away.
"There's a ghost!"
There was a pause.
The Pharmacist System?
As he spoke these words, a light curtain appeared in front of him, which resembled a panel of people in the midst of the king's distress.
It is an illusion, an illusion.
He shook his head violently, and the empty light curtain disappeared.
At this point, a dog rushed down the hill and came to him, spitting his tongue and wagging his tail, looking very happy.
"Where are you going?"
This is Wang Yaofei's clay dog, who accompanied him on this mountain for three years; one dog went into a hut on the mountain, and Wang Yaofei went to bed, feeling somewhat dizzy.
"What is that?"
He reappears in the episode's title sequence, as if he was trying to make a name for himself.
"Here we go again!"
After a few tests, Wang Yao determined that the object was not an illusion, but something real, something that could not be explained by science: it had characters, skills, and packages, like in an online game.
Ninja: You're not even a bird, you're just an egg!
Physical fitness 1, strength 0.9, mental strength 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average for normal adult males).
It's true, he's all covered up.
It is said that he is now growing herbs, and what is missing is this! The king who came back to the gods suddenly jumped up in excitement and scared the "Three Fresh" on the side.
There is also a skill panel: Wang Yao thinks a little but does not see it.
"Why can't you open it?" he asked.
"All the herbs are bad, and I want to do something else.
He seems to have heard his doubts, and this line of text pops up on the panel.
Who designed it? Come out, I promise not to kill you! "What is it?"
In the middle of the book, he finds a bottle of wine.
There is a fountain in the centre of the house, with a fountain and a fountain.
How do you use it?
It was a wooden kettle, old and antique, with some weight in it, a slight shake, and a rustle in it.
"Is there really water, old spring?"
He took a bucket from the room and emptied the water from the kettle, a small pot of water, but it kept coming out until the entire bucket was filled.
Wonderful?
The king looked at the water in the bucket, it was very clean, it was very clean, and he held a mouthful in his mouth, it was very sweet.
Good Drink!
He picks up the bowl on the table, scoops it up and drinks it, then stops and drinks the water, feeling that the whole person is much more comfortable and the fatigue is gone.
It is surrounded by water, and three of its walls are covered with water.
"Come on, you have a drink."
Wang Yao put a bowl of water in the bowl he was drinking, and the dog soon drank it all up, then cried out again, wagging his tail, apparently not drinking enough.
"OK, let's get you a drink!"
This man and a dog drank half a bucket of water, and if they did not panic, it was assumed that the bucket would be consumed by them.
I have never seen such a thing in my life.
I Want to Lose Weight!
On a hot summer day, in the eastern part of the federation, the rain forest of the pond clouds, the fog filled, as if surrounded by a veil, a single ancient tree, crisscrossing, luxuriant canopy, sometimes several birds soaring in the sky, hissing and soaring in the sky.
The sun in the sky, as if it could live forever, is no longer remembered, but many years ago it was pierced directly by an ancient bronze sword so large as to be indescribable, revealing half the tip of the sword!
This ancient sword seems to have passed through the ages, coming from the starry sky, passing through unending vicissitudes, and with an even greater power, forming a halo, enveloping the sky, as if it could suppress the earth and make all living beings worship it!
Seen from a distance, the scene of the Kenyan rainforest looks like a picture scroll until it is broken by a buzzing sound in the distance, when a large red hot air balloon is flying slowly over the rainforest.
The balloon cabin was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and many boys and girls could be seen, huddled in groups on the deck, sometimes with laughter.
They were from Phoenix, one of the four major federal convents in the United States, and they were on board an airship that belonged to the Ethereal Seminary, crossing a mile to Ethereal Seminary.
This may be due to the fact that it is not uncommon for girls and boys to be attracted to each other, and it is not uncommon for girls and boys to be attracted to each other.
As a result of this, the ship was equipped with a dining room, a repair room, and a medical room.
At the end of the series, a group of young men sit at a table in the middle of the room.
The young man, about seventeen years old, was dressed in a large blue robe, with a round face that was barely noticeable, and was clapping his stomach, making a crackling sound, looking at seven or eight empty plates in front of him with remorse.
"I can't bear it, and I can't die young if I want to be president of the Union."
The little man, with a grimace on his face, burped in his remorse; the little man, named Wang Bao Le, who had been admitted to an ethereal seminary this time, and whose lifelong dream was to be an officer, to be the President of the Union, was his lifelong pursuit, and the greatness of his ideal was inextricably linked to his childhood.
When he was a child, his father often slapped him in the face.
"Well," he said, "if you want to be an officer, you have to remember that money can solve everything, but you will still be bullied, you will not be bullied, you will only be an officer, you will be a person."
In the beginning, he did not understand, until he was in elementary school, because he did not finish his homework on time, he was reprimanded by the class leader, and after he sent two pieces of sugar, he was named by the class leader and gave a small report to the teacher, all of which left an indelible mark in his young mind.
From that moment on, he wanted to be a captain, not to bully people, but to be able to bully others.
But as he grew up, he found that he could bully a lot more, and he felt that no one really dared to bully himself as the largest official, the President of the Federation.
He is not very good, but he has a good family line, and he still remembers that one night, when his father was in the family shrine, he gave him a look at the family tree.
It was the first time Wang Bao Le had seen the genealogy, and he clearly saw that the ancestors of all generations, who weighed more than 200 kg, died young and did not live more than 35 years.
That night, Wang had a dream... before he became president of the United States, he was reunited with the fat men.
In the following year, he went on to lose weight, but even after the Federation entered the Reiyuan Era, with a strong spirit, and with the revival of Kwu, there were various ways to lose weight, but Wang Bao Le tried almost everything, and the weight remained steady.
In the end, he decides to give up his life and decide to lose weight again tomorrow.
After a few moments of silence, the king began to think that he was too weak, too weak, too strong, too weak, too weak, too weak, too weak, too weak, too weak, too weak, too weak.
"I don't know what to give Dr. Lew, he likes it or not, but it's an antique that I came out of my house, and the old man should like it."
In the end, he was able to convince himself that he was a good doctor, and that he would be able to take care of himself while he was in the hospital.
"I'm not sure, but I think it's going to be a lot of fun," he said, "and I don't know what to do."
As a result, the President of the United States was forced to resign from his position as President.
He was confident that he would become President of the United States, largely because of all the autobiographies of his senior officials, from childhood to adulthood, and even to the point where he concluded that he was the best candidate for the presidency.
The sky is blue, and the sky is blue, and the sky is blue.
In the middle of the night, he sees a dark cloud, a dark cloud, and a thunderbolt, and then a flash of lightning, and then a flash of lightning, and then a flash of lightning.
It was also the first time in the history of the United States that a ship had been able to land on the surface of the ocean, and it was the first time in the history of the United States that a ship had been able to land on the surface of the ocean, and it was the first time in history that a ship had been able to land on the surface of the ocean.
As the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, and the wind blows.
In the midst of this confusion, the door of the dining room was pushed open, as if the wind were roaring, and an old man in a white robe entered the dining room, whose face was wrinkled and wrinkled, but whose face was fair, and whose eyes, especially those of the light, were shining, and whose voice, as soon as it came, was heard throughout the dining room.
"Everyone, report immediately in the room, put on your magnetic suit, and after half a pillar of incense, we will enter the thunder magnetic field!"
When they arrive, they are greeted by a group of schoolchildren, all of whom are terrified.
In the end, the old man, who is the same as the old man, and the old man, who is the same as the old man, look at each other and think that the old man's investment is right, and that the old man is a good man, and that he is a good man himself.
When the old man saw that he was wearing a black mask, he looked up and saw the old man standing in front of him.
"At a young age," said the old doctor, "do not put your mind in a messy place, you have learned to give before you entered the priesthood, and the old man is a man of great knowledge, you can keep the mask, or you can keep it yourself."
In the first chapter, the narrator explains that the narrator is in a state of agitation, and that the narrator is in a state of agitation, and that the narrator is in a state of agitation, and that the narrator is in a state of agitation, and that the narrator is in a state of agitation, and that the narrator is in a state of agitation.
He takes a deep breath and quickly makes a remorse, admitting his mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong!"
The doctor is surprised to find that some of the words he used to reprimand her are not correct because they are so easy to understand.
The old man's face, his face, and the expression of the old man's face are all too familiar to him, and he has a sense of pride.
The old doctor hummed and looked up at all the students in the dining room, with his right hand pointing at them.
"And you, all of you, you are the students of the future of the monastery, and see what you are like these days, and you shall always remember that we, the warriors, should stand up first, speak then speak, and then act!"
In the end, all the people of the world will be saved, and all the people of the world will be saved, and all the people of the world will be saved.
It is said that he took a little book out of his arms, wrote it down, looked up at the old doctor from time to time, showed the expression of listening, and nodded seriously, as if to remember every word that the other person said, this trick is also a killer that he summarized in the autobiography of the senior officer.
The other students look at the scene, as if they are seeing a god looking at the king.
In the first episode of the series, he is shown to be a young man who has never seen anything like it before, but who has never seen anything like it before, and has never seen anything like it before.
"Little man, the old man's farting is not so good, you have to thank the thunderstorm, otherwise the old man can train three days and three nights at a time, I see if you can write all on the little book!"
In the novel, the Doctor is shown to have a strong sense of humour, a sense of humour, a sense of humour, a sense of humour, and a sense of humour, a sense of humour, and a sense of humour.
In the middle of the night, while he was waiting for the door to open, he looked at the clock and saw that the clock was ticking and that the clock was ticking, and that the clock was ticking, and that the clock was ticking.
As a result of this, the old man became very angry and said a few words.
"You must remember to put your mind on cultivation, and to be a person in the future, not to be greedy, not to be unjust, and not to always think about finding a girlfriend, and to know a knife in the first place, these days, you are too much to say!"
Suddenly, a delicate voice comes out of the old doctor's bracelets.
"What are you going to do about it?" he asked. "What are you going to do?"
"Oh, come on, baby, I'm going to come and help you," said the old man, with a sigh of relief.
It was a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, short, and short, and long, long, short, short, and short, long, short, short, short, short, short, long.
"'한끼줍쇼' 이영 X 한끼성공, '한끼성공', '한끼성공', '한끼성공' (종합)."
The more he thought about it, the more angry he became with his classmates, and the more determined he became in his dream of becoming a government official.
As the police arrive, they hear a loud noise, and are immediately taken to the police station.
The airship, which is located in the core area of the airship, is, by definition, a place for students to practice, and is also the place where the airship is most closely protected as it passes through a special area.
At the end of the series, all of the members of the crew of the ship are seen in the same room, wearing the same clothes as the other members of the crew.
As he was about to leave the house, he looked up at her, and saw that she was standing in front of him, and that she was standing in front of him, looking up at him, and he was looking down at her.
In his eyes, there was a girl with slender legs, very touching, but also frowning and disgusting at the moment, apparently familiar and disgusting to each other in their eyes.
"Achilles!"
They both look at each other as if they were looking at each other.
"What is the matter with you?" cried the old man, "what is the matter with you, and what is the matter with you?"
In the meantime, the crew of the ship, who had been on board the ship for some time, had come to the conclusion that the ship was in danger of being sunk, and that the ship was in danger of being sunk.
When they arrive, they find that the ship has been sunk, and the doors of the ship have been sealed, and the lights have been turned off.
As time goes by, the room becomes more and more tense, and no one speaks, falling into complete silence.
In the silence of his heart, which seemed to be heard, even Wang Bao Le, who was still angry, could not help feeling nervous, until after the half-pillar incense, the entire airship burst into a thunderous magnetic area!
From the outside, the entire thunderstorm is majestic, as if it were a large mouth, and compared to it, it is a small hot air balloon airship, directly engulfed.
It is said to be the most powerful of the seven, and the most powerful of the seven, and the most powerful of the seven, and the most powerful of the seven, and the most powerful of the seven.
This is a 37-year period.
In the year 329 A.D., the rapid development of science and technology on the earth, without national borders, realized the unity of the earth and entered the age of the federation, and it was at this time that a large sword flew from the starry sky and pierced the sun, and the world was shocked.
The sword's hilt may have been shattered by the violent shaking, breaking many pieces and sprinkling the stars, some of which fell all over the earth.
With the arrival of the Bronze Sword, and with the fall of the fragments, there suddenly appeared on Earth a new energy that seemed to pervade the heavens and the earth, and was later named... Reiki!
In some cases, such as in the United States, the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," and the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air," and the use of the term "air," the use of the term "air."
As a result, the Earth has been transformed into a place where people not only live, but also live, and the Earth has been transformed into a place where civilization can flourish and flourish.
From this point on, the world began to change, and the world began to change.
The History of the Lordship.
At this time, in the thundercloud, the red hot-air balloon airship, which was traveling slowly, had numerous lightning strikes for four weeks, and was constantly bombarded, so that a soft light curtain spread around and around the airship, so that the airship was extremely stable.
As for the spiritual chamber in the core area of the ship, all the students, including Wang Bao Le, have fallen asleep unknowingly, as if there is a strange force that guides them into their dreams.
Only in the bow of the ship, there are now seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some laughing, talking to each other in a relaxed manner, quite different from the way they scared the students before.
The first was an old man with a wrinkled face, who was holding a gun and was smoking a mouthful, and if Wang Bao was here, he would have recognized the old man, who was the shameless old doctor.
As a middle-aged teacher speaks, the old doctor, who smokes, smiles.
