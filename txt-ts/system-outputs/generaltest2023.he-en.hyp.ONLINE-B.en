Under the threat of extinction: three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The fastest animal in the world falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and fatal road accidents throughout the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asiatic cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the animal, which is in danger of extinction in the country due to forms, hunters and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of cheetahs in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
In the Iranian news agency "IRNA" it was reported that the veterinary team, in charge of the Turan National Park in the northern Samnan district, decided on a cesarean delivery in captivity.
It was also noted that less than 20 cheetahs were recorded in the last period in seven different districts of the country.
Following the danger of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran they hope that the new cubs can lead to an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, the Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs in Iran, Hassan Akbari, said that the population of cheetahs in the country has decreased dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to only 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs fell victim to drought in their living areas, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching a speed of about 100 km/h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the hardware world as well •
After years of development - Car Thing was revealed and launched as a small experiment in the USA •
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
The vision: to make your old vehicles smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual testers in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox - an opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and 4th generation connectivity, which will make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly died down until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new car product simulating a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the vehicle mode - the same one we know today from the app - which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, last April Spotify revealed "Car Thing", its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference that took place, I went to the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the website will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with its build quality.
It is slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a larger, brighter and sharper touch screen on the front than I expected.
You will also find a round button and a dial next to the screen that you can turn to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would have preferred the company to allow changing the activity of the dial so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe this will be enabled in a future version update.
The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings back that feeling with its construction.
All the adapters were connected to the body of the device using a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition to that, along its entire upper part you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to activate different playlists or podcasts.
By long-pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged the Car Thing in.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
Meaning, you will still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the application, since like the smartphone application, it emphasizes the album images and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the application, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.
Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify".
Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, it recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed in the upper part.
It is important to note that currently the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publishing the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering that it is still in an initial release stage.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, every now and then there is a small stutter in the interface, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that have leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it to.
After all, his activity amounts to controlling the application on the smartphone, and not much beyond that.
How is it different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to us while driving?
This question is strengthened when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will give the user much more functionality.
Despite all that, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it can improve the driving experience.
Being able to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.
It hasn't even shared how many testers for the device it's currently running around the world, and how many it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the expected price of 79 dollars (about NIS 255).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first look at a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel stated that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel

Did you recruit talent for the company?
That's how you'll keep your competitors from "hijacking" it from you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents •
Here are some tips to help you maintain it in the workplace
.
Despite the increase registered in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is mostly controlled by the workers and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
As far as those professionals and managers who are centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability are concerned - the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talents as they are called by the employers, still exists in full force.
The meaning of this for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a desirable talent, because as soon as he enters the company's gates - another company will already try to kidnap him.
In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that many, even after being hired, will continue to receive a host of tempting job offers, when 30% of employees actually leave only a month after accepting the position and starting work.
This is the reason why wise employers will immediately move from the phase of recruiting talent to the phase of retaining it, when the path begins first and foremost with preparation in advance and taking creativity already in the process of absorbing it.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent enthusiastic about his new workplace from the very first day and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a correct absorption process that will help in retaining the new talent:
It's not a secret - sharing and organization readiness
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his value, will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on him.
Knowledge is power - coordination of expectations
Already on the first day, have a meeting with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know his professional background and check where he sees himself in the future, so that you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people - personal acquaintance
During the days of absorption, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his role will appreciate it and want to keep it that way.
Curiosity promotes
Already in the absorption phase you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or an interesting technology, since this type of stimulation for creativity leads to increased curiosity and interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear to them that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in your pocket: the cost of not closing the coal stations in June - one billion shekels
Report of the Knesset's Research and Information Center: The failure to close the coal plants on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at about one billion shekels
• The Electric Company: "The fuel usage policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal plants by the date set in June 2022 is estimated at about one billion shekels for the year 2022, according to a report by the Knesset's Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the electricity tariff for the consumer, which, as mentioned, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition to this, in 2023 an additional excess amount of coal use of approximately 900 thousand tons is expected, so that this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity sector for not closing the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that the reduction of approximately one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of approximately 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the home consumer.
That is, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion shekels, and the total discount that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Electric Company, which will build units powered by natural gas, intended to replace the coal-fired units 4-1 at the Orot Rabin site.
Further to this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the activity of the coal-fired production units 4-1 at the Orot Rabin power plant must be stopped.
The decision established timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the coal-fired production units 4-1 will also stop operating at that time.
The electricity company responded: "The fuel usage policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."
Paying the price: everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate hike
Constant decrees: next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to increase by half a percent •
How much more expensive will the mortgage payment be?
And what is recommended to do? •
all the answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
The analysts' estimates speak of an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, it will already stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases the mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens the households.
With the help of Shai Zror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent - how much more expensive will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?
For a mortgage in the amount of NIS 1.2 million, which consists of a 40% prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates on the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just the prime track) have also gone up - in the index-linked track and the fixed interest track.
If the interest rate does go up by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Zror's estimate, to about NIS 620 on a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.
The prime route (40% in this route) will complete a price increase of about NIS 280, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The index-linked variable interest rate (26.7% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about NIS 120.
The fixed interest track - not linked to an index (33.3% in this track) will become more expensive by NIS 220.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have an index-linked rifle mortgage, Saror recommends considering recycling to routes that are not index-linked.
For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments - he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So also in the future when the interest rates will drop, they will be able to recycle a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding apartment buyers from a contractor - Seror recommends making payments to the contractor in advance and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6% in the last year.
Against the background of the increase in the price of this index, on Tuesday the supervision of the banks announced that it is considering mandating the creation of a mechanism that would allow the linkages to be included in the mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08 •
At the same time, the reduction of half a NIS per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022
A record of a decade: the price of gasoline will jump by 36 shekels per liter - and will be more than NIS 8 per liter as of July 1.
The new price per liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay another 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel fuel tax will be extended until the end of 2022 - the Tax Authority said.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued increase in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the increase in the dollar exchange rate.
If it weren't for the half-shekel discount that the government has been subsidizing since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded the all-time high - 8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting the publication for public comments of a decree extending the tax reduction on gasoline, which is half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting on August 10, another reduction of half a shekel will be established, so that only from this date the price of a liter of gasoline will be reduced by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a situation where I don't remember five months in a row of excess in state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on the extension of the excise, gasoline and diesel tax by four months - instead of half a shekel per shekel.
It is good for the industry and the citizen.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, lower production and lower the cost of living.
As Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus on this first," said Minister Lieberman at the Israel Democracy Institute's Horvitz Conference on Economy and Society.
As of today, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high rate of taxation compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic effect on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household expenses and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Petah Tikva came in second place in the ranking of doing business by the Ministry of Economy •
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion •
Minister Barbiei: "The corona has emphasized the importance of local government in business development"
.
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium businesses.
This is the third year in a row - this is what the index of doing business in the local authorities found of the Agency for Small and Medium Businesses in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked the local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
After them are placed in order: Ashkelon, Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the index of local authorities.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a working tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are tested in each authority, which examine the level of "friendliness" of the authority to the businesses in its area.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of inhabitants, since a local authority of up to 50 thousand inhabitants is not similar to a local authority of more than 150 thousand inhabitants.
Tel Aviv jumped this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A drop in rating does not mean that the authority's service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it results from the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have gone up in rating, while the authority that has dropped in rating has improved its services to businesses less.
Among the newcomers in the ranking can be found Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business - engine of growth"
The ranking shows that Nof HaGilil is a leader in local authorities that include between 50 and 150 thousand residents.
After it are located Kiryat Motzkin, Meta Binyamin, Modi'in-Maccabim-Reot, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In the 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the time the business opens and throughout its activity with the authorities," says the Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbibai.
"The businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business output and about 60% of the employed in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses located there.
The corona virus emphasized the importance of local government and we saw that authorities that acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them."
Ran Kuiti, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential part in the ability of businesses in their field to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, when we are dealing with the corona crisis, the authorities have a greater weight in helping businesses survive in their field and survive in general."
2021 by mail: 20 packages per household - and a jump in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - this is according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The amount of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 - when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% per year in the weight of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products from abroad arrived in Israel, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The jump in package weight is mainly influenced by two major trends, both from the seller's and the buyer's side: the major shopping sites abroad combine items into one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the fast delivery of the shipments, within a few days from the moment of the order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which those buyers wish to receive close to making the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the most packages arrived from abroad with the highest weight and the highest number of items is the month of December, with 4.2 million packages with a total weight of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, apparently following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders start arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are not aware that they can receive tax refunds
Many employees receive money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels •
Have you changed jobs?
Did you go out to Halat?
Did you move from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a significant amount in a simple procedure •
All the details are inside
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to high amounts.
The State Comptroller stated in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds in the amount of 3.6 billion shekels, which means that you should also check whether you are entitled to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, since four out of five employees are entitled to tax refunds.
In practice, on the other hand, they serve several tens of thousands of employees per year.
If you think that these funds have gone down the drain anyway, think again: employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for six years back.
The Tax:On company conducted an in-depth study among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax refunds during the year 2020.
The company has over 30 thousand customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of groups in the population and in terms of gender, ages and geography.
The data shows that during the year 2020, due to the outbreak of the Corona crisis and the spending of hundreds of thousands of workers on unemployment benefits, there were a number of significant changes, the center of which was a 15% increase in the amount of the average reimbursement to a single family, which amounted to NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the tax dues are lower than the salaries, so there is a gap between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a client of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons to receive tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of the people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund in the average amount of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of the women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a refund in the average amount of NIS 3,538 for that year
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people donating and paying taxes got a refund.
Another factor for reimbursement is not registering credit points for alimony. 63%
For the divorced, we did not update a credit point for alimony, therefore the tax refund for each year that such a credit point was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - spending on unemployment benefits: 93% of those who were sick or unemployed and who earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: refund for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, refund for a qualifying return, refund for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for a man for giving birth and distribution of tax refunds according to geographic location.
- 94% of the people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were entitled to a tax refund.
In an inspection conducted on every million shekels of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over 20,000 shekels for the entire mortgage period
100% of those who move to a qualifying settlement received a tax refund for the year of the move since confirmation of residency in a qualifying settlement is given only after 12 months from the day the resident became a qualifying resident, thus effectively the first year full tax is paid.
79% of the customers holding securities were entitled to a tax refund for the aforementioned years.
However, it is important for those who hold securities to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only through the submission of a report.
56% of the men who had a child do not register credit points in the year of birth on the payslip.
The repayment rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
CEO of tax:on, Tal Carmon: "The corona crisis has meant that the salaried public in Israel has become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he deserves in returns from the income tax.
It turns out that hundreds of thousands of Israelis sitting at home, on unemployment benefits or after layoffs, for many months, caused many employees to take a deep look at what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today all procedures for receiving tax refunds can be carried out digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past.'
The job market: fewer job applicants, more pay
AllJobs 2021 summary report: at the top of the demand - jobs without experience •
The scope of jobs offered increased by 50% •
"Looking for a job, but not storming the market"
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and for each position only 23 candidates competed on average, compared to 41 candidates the previous year - according to a report by the AllJobs website summarizing the year 2021, on the corona crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel
According to the report, the job seekers were mainly interested in areas saturated with jobs such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 CVs were sent.
However, the jobs without experience led the demand with more than 38 thousand searches - probably due to the return of young people without professional experience to look for immediate work, at the end of the Halat payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and maintenance had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the corona crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The monthly salary in the software field was NIS 17,915 on average, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000: in the center of the country it was NIS 12,500 on average, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours, remained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to women's wages of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back into the groove
On the business side, horizontal growth was recorded in almost all branches of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the offer of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40 thousand jobs in AllJobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them testified that they intend to increase the total number of hires, but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest offer was for jobs without experience - and there were more than 58 thousand of them on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with approximately 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouse workers still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, director of research and content at AllJobs: "The job seekers are trying to get back into the groove but are not attacking the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work circle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living."

"Not obvious": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that "we can live the way we want", gets excited about meeting the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children •
The weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"The weekends are the most important moments in life, as far as I'm concerned.
The sanctification and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to the children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for Kiddush, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play with cars on a sign.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood - and there is always another excuse.
When we return home with the multitude of gifts, the smells of cooking greet us."
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I was blessed by the cooking around me.
On my side there is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, comes the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law's, already from the lobby of the building, amazing smells are coming from her apartment.
I usually do the Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflatable."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Channel C and the skits of The Pale Tracker, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud in his heart.
He died three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the holiest of holies, especially from the point of view that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Shomer eliket', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son."
Soon we will celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As an avid Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is privileged to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day I would already climb trees and tie strings with Israeli flags to the house.
Today, my days of independence are full of performances, and I always meet an insanely happy crowd, celebrating the fact that we can live as we please.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted."
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim blesses Shabbat
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": the Friday dinner Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband observes Shabbat?
Tell me about your preparations for Shabbat
.
"Preparations start already on Thursday night, when I return from a show or a workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as golash, roasts and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate the time to myself, meeting friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just watch a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Verda, who celebrated her 89th birthday, and also friends."
Can you share more about cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting them and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I prepare most of the dishes, and of course they heat up on the stove on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, prepares chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious person and you come from a secular home.
How It Works?
"Living with a Shabbat observant is an endless compromise.
'Love your neighbor as yourself', practically.
He can't go on family trips, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the driver on duty for the children, the one who brings them back on Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because usually I don't perform on Shabbat and get a sort of 'forced vacation' - and that's a good thing."
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite 'my dead'.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother, the late Daniel, was alive, or if my father, the late Shneor, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have argued about football and politics and were proud of each other."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family.
On Friday at noon, my mother would prepare a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pitas from the market and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hana's Yad Eliyahu, or as she used to say, 'Yad Alyike', and she would prepare linches.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and worried about me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the port of Jaffa, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, arrived in Israel with nothing."

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged
Almost two decades after their love story that ended in separation, Lopez and Affleck return to each other's arms •
Lopez split from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: almost two decades after their first love story that ended in separation and a year after the publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and are engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news with her fans yesterday evening (Friday) on her official website onthejlo.com
.
News of the engagement comes after Lopez was spotted walking around this week with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and proposed to Lopez (52) to be his forever it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-popping ring with a huge pink diamond of six carats, with an estimated value of about 2.5 million dollars.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of excessive obsession and incessant prying into their lives.
Since then, Affleck managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as we know, has already been married 3 times in the past, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she split in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians speak: "You can't make up what's happening to us"
"The chaos never ends", mother Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the first family of the reality show, and receives backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In the article that will be published in "Shishab" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR mill, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the one who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie I should post"
It may surprise many, but the most in-demand brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, which also includes the Marvel movies and "Star Wars," is the Kardashian family.
The details of the contract of the first family of the reality show and the social networks with Disney were not disclosed, but the estimates claim a minimum amount of one hundred million dollars that was transferred to the daughters of the family, who now also function as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each of them accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of make-up touch-ups, hair and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the daughters of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not about reality, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't make up what's happening to us," the mother of the family, Kris Jenner, says firmly, "the chaos is never-ending."
"We show how much we've grown since that series that came out in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started we were scared, a lot happens to us in life and you can't simply limit everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
Many plots were rushed through the editing, wrapped in a ticking colorful film and forgotten to the side.
This is not what life looks like in reality.
Now we are more exposed, facing the camera directly, naturally, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series."
When you compare them with their new involvement in the production of the series, which in fact gives them total control over the content that is received on the screen, Chloe claims: "We are involved behind the scenes, we see segments during editing and give comments, but not from a defensive position but simply to give our opinion about what will make the series for the better
It is a mirror of our lives and I personally feel that I have undergone emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they are more boundary-setting."
"I grew up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from cheap reality trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up," she claims, "I am raising four black children, meaning from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
This is my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie I should upload," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A person must be loyal to who he really is and take everything in stride."
About the reasons for the producer's dismissals discovered by Ryan Seacrest and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the meaning of the move to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its effect on the brand's profitability and more, in the full article that will be published in "Shishab" magazine.

Aviv Gefen and Sharit Hadad: The creative outdoor festival in Jerusalem with new surprises
The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will be held in several centers, will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus shows and innovative and surprising artistic performances
.
Like every summer over the years, along with the heat, humidity and boredom of the students, comes the International Outdoor Festival that creates Jerusalem, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will be held in several locations (including the Mitchell Garden, the Sultan's Pool, in front of the Tower of David and at the foot of the Old City walls) - between the dates 15 August 27th.
As part of the festival, there will be musical performances every day by many artists, including Sharit Haddad, Kobi Peretz, Aviv Gefen and Atoyot who will host Natasha's friends, Shlomi Shabat, Idan Habib, Natan Goshen, Nasrin Kadri, Danny Sanderson who will host Tissalem and Amir Dadon, Nega Erez and more.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on the relationship with his father
The winner of "The Next Star" finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
"The song tells about the way to maintain the relationship from a distance," he says
Tamir Greenberg in a second single called Into The Night after conquering the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg continues to perform many concerts: the Tel Aviv Cultural Center, the Tel Aviv Opera House, the Shoni Amphitheatre, the Yehoshua Gardens Amphitheatre, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song Into The Night was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with the producer Stav Begar.
The clip, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the USA and the way to maintain the relationship from a distance," says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in blue and white: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenomenon climbed Mount Madurayama in 26 seconds and won the title "The First Israeli Ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the Ninja title.
God
There is a winner: Yuval Shamla conquered Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been participating in the show since its first season, when he finished in first place, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
Tonight he climbed Mt. Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating the contestants Yogev Malka Vichy Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, only one ninja who managed to climb Midoriyama in time can be crowned in each season.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, because Yuval Shamla, the season's winner, climbed Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the world ninja title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Well, we understand, that full of superheroes, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sports event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat on the finale of a reality show and acted as if it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect female ideal, that it is distorted to present it like this on television.
She earns more from campaigns than Wonder Woman, she is too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary - also defend her business partner.
She is a mother as well as a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads reality series and shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rutam Sela is too perfect, because in the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is larger than life, and guides first.
After all, Assi Ezer got involved in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a certain period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being - he got out of it even before the first set of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who in his life broadcast European Cup wins and world records, but is excited by a megawall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on earth.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Yordan Jarbi and Linui Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entry into the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons are.
"Ninja Israel" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and a full Yuval who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
An almost impassable route led there, which brought down one by one all the superhuman characters whose egos the show made sure to inflate throughout the year.
Want to be a ninja turtle?
Not with us.
Looking for superheroes here.
The emphasis was on the search for a successor to Shmla, who is known as "the king of kings and one of a kind", and other nicknames intended to clarify how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season's courses crashed, and the boys competed among themselves to see who had more squares in their stomachs and the charisma of Diket in order to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamla HaForesh.
It will be said that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and shows overcoming difficulties and challenges, but from the point of view of the absolute majority of viewers - mediocre couch potatoes like us - "Ninja Israel" cultivates for us an unattainable sports-achievement model.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sasover moves between punches and talks about sanctity
It's strange to see the comedian, ex "Comedy Store", hosting the show "Kabbalat Shabbat" on Channel 14, where he tastes the spices and gives a platform mainly to men
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the term 'preparations for Shabbat' remind you of?".
Say: sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sasover".
Because Gil Sessover in the middle of the sponge and cooking is the most unrelated that television can offer.
And really, "Kabbalat Shabbat", the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the time it is broadcast.
Along half of it - Sassober stands.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense it will be said that the scarcity of the budget is noticeable, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was still felt in the premiere program, which was broadcast the other day from Mata Binyamin, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play music, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women contented themselves with a small item, in which they excitedly talked about running a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Kabbalt Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now 14
The sheltered housing union against Ruthie Russo: "To say 'it has the taste of sheltered housing' harms our activity"
Chairman Yuli Gat sent a letter, in which she expressed the union's complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show •
Ruthie Russo responded: "I'm glad there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Sheltered Housing in Israel against the "next restaurant": In a letter sent by its chairman Yuli Gat and reached by Israel Hayom, it reads as follows: "In the pre-broadcast trailer, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said, 'The food has the taste of Sheltered housing', that is, food in a closed institution with low-level food.'
"The tone chosen by the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant served instantly cancels our many years of activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, this is because the shelters operate restaurants in the various houses for the benefit of the residents with the highest level chef's dishes."
It also reads: "The service teams and the managers of the homes are fighting for the image of the sheltered housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more."
In recent years in Israel, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serve the tenants the finest food.
Most of the shelters use professional chefs to create a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the team of judges to be impressed by the winning dishes that are served every day to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and the restaurant staff at the shelters, we would like your apology and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly.'
Ruthie Russo said in response: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks everywhere, even in sheltered housing."
"Double standards: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed the criticism hurled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards •
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Earlier this week, Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia due to the war and declared that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon".
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet slammed the singer as a hypocrite, since in 2017 Kyiv refused to cancel two concerts that took place in Israel, despite the heavy criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Kiev told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Akhmat remembered very well Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine," Akhmet wrote. "The fact that you did not support the Palestinians like that, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the factor responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It saddens me a lot, as you represent a double standard here," the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of Europe as a whole.
The second situation is a complex friction between two nations.
The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a lot of sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who it is."
Kiev added that although he is not interested in detailing his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly also supports the Palestinians, noting that in the last 20 years he has often participated in fundraising events on their behalf.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet," the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their land.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them - I would."
In light of the decrease in morbidity: the Corona Projector will return to manage Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treating Corona in the third wave and the fourth wave •
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitzan Horowitz, will simultaneously continue in his position as a projector •
Prof. Zarka: "I'm glad that the Umicron wave continues to fade, and it's still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the background of the decrease in the incidence of the corona virus, the projector of the corona virus, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage the Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz, he will simultaneously continue his position as a projector.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the micron wave continues to fade and that we got our normal way of life back," said Prof. Zarka, adding: "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the corona treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave.
As of May 1st, Israel returned to a "between waves" situation, which includes reducing most of the Corona arrays, while maintaining the ability to perform sequence tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Occult morbidity
In the report of the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona Campaign, which was published this morning, it was stated that "there is a decrease in the average of newly confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients and those hospitalized in serious condition."
However, they emphasized that "there is a hidden morbidity on a significant scale and in practice the number of infected people is much higher.
The number of institutional tests that are carried out in the community (without considering the tests of the returnees from abroad, MI) - is low, and stands at less than 20 thousand tests on a weekly average only.
The low scope of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends."
The State Comptroller's report: the actual budget in most years of activity of the Medicines Basket Committee is smaller than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of activity of the Basket - the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activity of the committee •
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published with a significant delay, if at all •
Also, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activity - and updating the procedures for the work of the basket •
Another deficiency that was found relates to the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have allowed for the analysis and control of the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medicines that will be given to the public free of charge through the health insurance funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without any control reports being made on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervise and review its activities.
"Israel Hayom" correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing revelations in "Israel Hayom" about the failures of the medicine basket.
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "to carry out corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health services basket budget that the public is entitled to".
Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism of the addition to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998-2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget - with the addition varying annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add approximately 800 new medicines and technologies to the basket of health services, with a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
In most of the years of the commission's operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor points out that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket work is lacking".
Thus, for example, the working procedure of the basket committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; because of this, the ability of the bidders - patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeated applications as soon as possible and relevant, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and carried out A renewed assessment regarding the possibility of accepting them in the next round," the auditor noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules established in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions - only one financial comment was submitted
Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of the evaluation of the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.
Another shortcoming concerns the activity of the sub-committee of the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The auditor recommends adding a public representative or exploring the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
In the procedure according to which the health services basket committee operates, it is established that "an economic evaluation must be submitted" for a request to add a medicine to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation was submitted out of thousands of submissions - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.
For example, for the discussions of the basket committee for the years 2019-2021, requests were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
From the report it emerged that the requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including an assessment of the amount that could be saved due to reducing the damage caused by obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health insurance funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccinations, provided by the Ministry of Health ("the third supplement") have also been included in the medicine basket.
This, when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.
In the last six years, NIS 74 million from the addition to the medicine basket was used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the work of the basket and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is necessary for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as "drugs without additional cost", the use of which does not cost the health insurance funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened route, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision of the use of particularly expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the basket committee's work began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health did not ask the health funds to report and did not monitor the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006-2009, and these were also published considerably late (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting the data and analyzing it, to the irrelevance of the conclusions emerging from the test after such a long period of time, to suboptimal pricing by the subcommittee and to making decisions based on inconclusive findings," the report states.
Also, the ministry does not audit and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned lessons.
These are 10 medicines that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2016-2021).
On this, the auditor wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the sub-committee, and about how the estimates are prepared when pricing the drugs and technologies and improve them."
"Horrifying and unimaginable": a stormy discussion in the health committee about the poisoning in Beit Dafna
The parameters of the first Jose who passed away were normal ten minutes before her death •
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: "If the people there cared about the kitchen being like at home - it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old Jose from the "Beit Dafna" daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, her medical parameters were taken which were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed today (Tuesday) at the hearing of the health committee.
"We have night nurses who check during the night and there is a nurse who makes rounds.
There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same tenant actually last time her measurements were taken 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other daycare workers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to get a baby to help transfer her and then the same resident did not respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse," the director of the daycare center described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and in total about a quarter of the residents of the daycare center (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated golesh meat.
The director of the daycare center said these things against the background of the claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, stated that "We cannot determine unequivocally what caused the three deaths.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
It was also brought up in the discussion that even from the tenants admitted to the hospital it was no longer possible to collect a stool sample because it was not his diarrhea and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also stated that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or at the request of a license renewal".
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for the previous case of defrauding the housekeepers that happened three months ago at the "Bnei Zion" institution in Sharon.
The chairman of the health committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: "If people there cared that the kitchen was like at home - it wouldn't look like this."
The residents in the welfare dormitories need more.
They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.
It is shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The horrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health was coming to check.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the offices?
How come in such a discussion the ministers and the CEOs of the ministries are not present to give an explanation of what is happening here?"
Yigal Nathumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein who manages the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire organization stand up with only one goal: to do good to people.
The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.
I anesthetized one of the tenants on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us."
Samdar Ona, a former resident of a residence the same age as her, burst out at him and said that "enough of the lies and nice words.
I was there".
Gali Barmi, parent representative at Akim Israel: "We have already complained about the food in the past and they did not accept the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of an equal opportunity initiative for the integration of people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased guardians were not published: "We don't know their names at all.
Are they worth less?
We underestimate the lives of our children."
Suspicion of an omission in Wolfson: the surgeon caused a tear in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as the director of the thoracic surgery unit at the hospital •
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment •
Hospital: "He is valued and experienced"
First publication: A horrifying mistake occurred at the Wolfson government hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor ruptured the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akhar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the board of doctors, Dr. Ronan Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he sent to the director of the hospital, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he made very serious allegations about the conduct of Dr. Engel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, this after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, in which the heart muscle is located, was discovered.
Also, the surgeon Dr. Abu Akhar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekal, director of the heart and thoracic surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the adjacent room, "was hurriedly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition to that, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekal contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar is not professionally and personally suitable for managing the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings, and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu Akhar for the position.
He further stated: "This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasts a few minutes", and added: "It is impossible not to refer to the poor process of accepting Dr. Abu Akhar for the position.
The question arises whether there is direct responsibility of Engel for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient."
An experienced surgeon
Information and claims of other senior doctors were presented to "Israel Today" that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronan Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon."
He also added that he was selected in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "disassociate" himself from the chest unit.
He also stated: "I was not a party to the procedure either, and it is possible that I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Fras Abu Akhar started working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 grace days, "All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in an unfortunate way.
The Wolfson Hospital responded: "We share in the family's grief.
This is a patient of the oncologist Dr. Ronan Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekal, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who unfortunately was in a very serious condition.
The hospital checks the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health knows the details of the case."

A model for healing: three senior doctors tell about their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the days of the plague •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Soknik •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with the patients •
Three key people in the hospitals write about those who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as people.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and the profession: on the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the figures who accompanied them at the beginning - and helped them become who they are today .
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I hadn't met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, sometime in the 80s of the last century.
For a moment I didn't think I would leave internal medicine, as I liked the patient care itself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in internal medicine, and basically in every field.
I thank him for bringing me to this field.
Throughout, I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a real and honest person, without ego, qualities that I really liked about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both of them, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day - for example "tissue is de personio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ makes it possible to know which drugs should be given; or "Once You Use It, You Lose It", which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at Sheva I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for anything.
He never complained, not even during his severe illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed at this time.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he was one of the leaders of the team for dealing with epidemics.

About the late Prof. Shaul Soknik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I did a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal medicine department that he managed.
Later I returned to the department also in the sixth year rotation, and I did the final thesis of the medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also - and above all - from a personal and human point of view.
During the internship I was debating between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted him about the choice of specialization.
In the end I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I was not persistent enough), in communication with patients, working in a multi-professional team - an area in which the department excelled - and basically, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from a question.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a training period abroad, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement I am not sure that this would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, Shaul was once again the one who supported and helped.
Later we managed complex periods together in the internal medicine division.
Shaul knew how to combine in a wonderful way the teacher, the manager, the friend and the partner of the team, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are today throughout the medical system in Israel, and perpetuate his memory and his work with their excellent work.
I am honored to be among this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, director of the Schneider Pediatrics Center
About Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at the Schneider Pediatric Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.
The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it goes without saying.
But I learned significant and even deeper things from him.
Looking back, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, the connection between the worlds is clear to me today; The education I received from Dr. Scheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Scheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nursing nurses, to the nursing teams both young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All this should be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and conversation stimulate a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a complete system.
The more in-depth and more rigorous understanding that takes place, integrating all the treating factors in the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and above all - early enough in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.
This is why Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure for me.
He is a person who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think quickly and accurately, listen - and then apply.

Medical negligence in the various stages of childbirth
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence
A birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
However, unfortunately, births sometimes end in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even consider applying for legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It must be emphasized that not every error in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that the management was negligent.
When then is it negligence?
When the doctor's mistake resulted from a lack of skill or a deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused damage to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, we will explain the complications that may occur in each of the stages and when they amount to medical negligence.
Stage the contractions
The labor phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix is gradually opened (to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most of the cases of medical negligence during the labor stage deal with the failure to recognize fetal distress before birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even manifesting itself in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by failure to recognize or delay in recognizing perinatal asphyxia, which is manifested in the failure of oxygen supply to the brain tissue of the fetus.
In general, monitoring the condition of the mother and correct interpretation of the monitor that follows the activity of the fetal heart should lead to early detection of the development of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases where the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of it and in particular the fetal monitor or reacts late to the distress expressed on the monitor - may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by prolapse of the umbilical cord, as well as by a uterine rupture that was not detected in time.
Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Raif Liganza, from the office of Caspi Seror & Co., which specializes in representing victims of medical negligence, says that her office handled the claim of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus's head was too high, thus causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and damage to the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and to be born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, a lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to the serious medical negligence of the staff of the maternity department at a large hospital who, during the birth, did not recognize clear signs at the time that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar from her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejected through the tear in his mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until he was rescued at a late stage when he was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by said negligence and not by any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators which, according to the medical literature, only in their existence is there a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.
the death of the fetus
The active labor stage
The active labor stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of caesarean section
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, that is, a lack of progress in the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a caesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in delivery.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus," attorney Raif-Liganza explained to us.
"For example, we managed a medical malpractice claim for the death of a newborn child caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.
Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff did not know how to recognize the fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused a lot of systemic damage to the woman, which finally led to her death shortly after her birth."
Malpractice in vacuum delivery
In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an extremely quick termination of the birth, a vacuum birth (empty vagina) is sometimes performed.
In this process, using a vacuum, a "cap" is attached to the embryo's head and the embryo is pulled out by force.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.
In these cases, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than allowed or when, despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more of the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases, if the negligent operation of the vacuum caused damage to the newborn - among other things, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause the development of brain damage - there is room for filing a tort claim.
Paralysis in the name of ERB
Paralysis named after Erv, here is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetrician.
The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'dislocated shoulders' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the shoulders of the fetus are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the evaluation of the weight of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms and according to the guidelines it is better to give birth to the mother by caesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a caesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores the abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and paralysis due to ERB materializes, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in AA 2694/90, the Supreme Court stated that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with one or another degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a fear of its occurrence, is to perform a caesarean section."
Placental exit stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it came out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the well-known complications resulting from placental remnants remaining in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome", the scarring of the uterine wall is the result of inflammation caused by placental remnants remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the endometrium in a way that does not allow the pregnancy to root.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not recognize that there were placenta remnants or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placenta remnants in the uterus, it is possible that this is medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
The death of the mother
Maternal death during childbirth is quite rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the woman giving birth on time or reacts late to said bleeding.
"For example...", Attorney Reif-Liganza told us, "our office filed a claim concerning the death of a woman giving birth, when in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the worrisome vital signs of the woman giving birth, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a complication It is known of the underlying disease from which she suffered."
"In another case...", said Attorney Reif-Liganza, "our office represented the relatives of a mother who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from the caesarean section that was not properly sutured.
In that case, the woman in labor complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death."
uterine loss
In serious cases, medical negligence during childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Raif Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after the birth.
In that case, the woman giving birth, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and despite this, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time."
What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence in childbirth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing care and paid treatment, wage losses and pension for the victim and even his parents and additional damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances," says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that "today, most lawsuits on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chances and risks that each party has in managing the procedure," but the attorney added and said that "There are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, so if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels" .
In conclusion
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic result, by an attorney skilled in managing medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye disease keratoconus in the south
A study revealed that there is a connection between the development of the disease and close marriages •
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease."
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a research basis for the suspicion that the eye disease keratoconus is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with changing the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, discovered that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and the distortion of its shape is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which the free radicals may damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the department of optometric sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "in a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2% was found.
The highest incidence was in students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but it was a relatively small sample."
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a high prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus.
Thus in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of keratoconus disease, all family members must undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, "there are ten times more visits to the clinic from distant peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center."
Fruchter adds that "In the last decade, I noticed that most of the patients apply from the outskirts, especially from the Beer Sheva area.
This is mainly due to a high incidence of marriages within the family (mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of how to properly treat the problem."
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops during adolescence or in the late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease includes a decrease in vision, at the same time as an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients show distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid pace and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients even testify to increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza - the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Khorfish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis •
Head of Amn: "The publication deserves him, his family and his children" •
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from a patrol of the General Staff will be examined
About three and a half years after the operation that became entangled in Khan Yunis, the IDF is today giving permission to publish that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Khorfish in the north.
41 years old was in Naples.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Younis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country.
"The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations unit.
An Israeli hero who was posthumously decorated with the Chief of Staff's Bezalesh.
He also said: "I paid tribute to him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir al-Din, openly.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the intelligence division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Horfish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmed and Nazira, and he had seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the special operations unit of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
Until the 9th grade he studied at the school in Kfar Horfish, after which he transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in the paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from officers' school.
In 2002, he was located by the special operations unit in the Amman and moved to serve there.
While serving, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they got married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Achrei" association and started guiding a group in Kfar Horfish, after making sure that the association started operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of AMN, Major General Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "We have been turning for some time on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security obstacle to publish his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children," he noted.
"Extraordinary educator and leader"
"Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes," said General Haliva.
"He has a significant contribution, which includes courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to be given the place he deserves."
And he added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an educator, an educator and an exceptional leader - not only on the operational side, but also in values."
Major Haliva stated that later he will also consider whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from the Defense Forces patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.
The action in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command squad of the operation sat the Chief of Staff at the time, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the head of the AMN at the time, Major General Tamir Heyman and the head of the Shin Bet at the time, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been released, and the IDF stressed that it was an operation whose intelligence value was invaluable.
But the Arab media retrospectively presented communication equipment that the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at burying listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas personnel, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The investigation in the field lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became more and more aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in that split second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed by the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Salvage Committee and award the Chief of Staff's Salvage to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - among them the late Lt. Col. Khair al-Din .
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter in the team also received a TLS.
In the army's statement at the time it was stated that Lt. Col. M received the TLS for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades.
Later he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a front role in taking over the enemy and worked resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to an extensive operation
Israel should ask itself, once again, if it is wrong to change policy towards the Jenin sector •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but Jenin's militants may not leave it a choice.
The stormy weekend we just had shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more explosive than ever.
It will take a lot of effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming commemoration dates: the "Nakba" day that falls today (Sunday), and the Jerusalem Day that will be celebrated in two weeks.
Quite a few parties will come forward in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
At their head, as always, are the elements of terrorism, who concentrate a special effort in trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of the last few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the late IMM fighter, Sergeant Major Noam Raz was killed the other day.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scale of shooting and violence - evidence not only of the enormous amount of IEDs on the ground, but also of the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, if it is not correct to change its policy towards the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to an extensive, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake; Even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid arson, but the Jenin militants may not leave it a choice.
draw lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have intentionally killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present in the arena.
The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of soldiers.
This indicates high morality, but it also has an operational-intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive - as happened the other day in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about IML, terrorist attacks and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through which it is possible foil the next attacks.
The IDF did the right thing when it released yesterday the interim investigation it conducted into the case of Abu Aqla's death, and clarified that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the case.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original reason for which the IDF continues to operate in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is to die out.
World public opinion is busy and moving on, certainly when an intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the case of Abu Aqla's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Aqla's family did not live up to the early summaries, one should have expected a little more panic from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excited by the Palestinian flags that were flown in it.
The responsibility requires: act to calm the situation.
The Minister of Internal Security and the Commissioner of Police did well to order the investigation of the incident.
It seems that he lacked sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but the fact that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts, is troubling.
Even in the Dizengoff attack, the police failed in managing the incident, isolating the scene and handling the media.
The investigative committee would do well if it not only analyzed the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also drew lessons and conclusions that would enable a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Along with the internal handling of the police, it is also required to give consideration to the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
In the Knesset of Israel there are currently several members who are seen as a danger to democracy.
They are found on the left and right, and take advantage of their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to take his actions even more extreme.
Such moves, which are considered a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political needs.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of these, and act to calm the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation against external enemies, and worse - against domestic rivals.
A senior police officer: "Government policy and setting goals are required here"
The Israel Police has indeed launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but the road is still long •
Today in the State of Israel there is no single factor that encompasses this whole issue."
"If you want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today, in the State of Israel, there is no single agency that covers this whole issue," a senior police officer told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon manifested itself in about 20 to 30 thousand Sheba'im who enter every day through the loopholes in the fence.
On top of that, between 100 and 110 thousand Palestinians with work permits enter to work in Israel every day through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six Day War, and the number of permits in each branch is limited by the quota set by the political rank according to the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, Sheba is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered Shabahim, but were not monitored, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required the security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, their entry through the loopholes in the fence is meaningless," says a senior security official, "those who want to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have already been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 Shebaim were arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are carried out only against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivists).
An illegal resident who is arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated a second time as well, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and charged with illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from each side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data received by Israel Hayom shows that in 2021, the police handled 40,010 illegal residents, drivers and squatters.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and a criminal case was opened against 19,533.
The number of employers, transporters and shippers handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and criminal cases were opened against 5,640.
"The foundations of the Shabaim phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society, not on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors," says a senior member of the law enforcement system.
"In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side, a price must be charged to prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the issue claim that the failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to a lack of prison places and the fact that arrests are only made when there are related offenses or it is a recidivist.
Legal sources claim that the decision to collect a price from Shabah only starting with his third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Whoever examines the punishment as well, will find that it is not a deterrent."
There is great complexity
Sheba," says a police official, "is a complex person."
He can be a father of a family who entered Israel to work to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and it is used by many types of Shebaim who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks."
Sheba can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents were caught by the police and even 8- and 10-year-old children were sent by their parents to road junctions, to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"It also makes the matter complex, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and file an indictment against them for neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical works or advanced construction works.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed Shebaim in garbage removal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major passes.
There are passages for vehicles and goods, there are passages through which only people pass, and there are passages which are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the crossings authority.
The Sheba'im are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living, and there are gangs whose main business is transporting Shebaim," says a senior police official, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can reach NIS 100 to NIS 300 per person.
Registered companies do not engage in this, because if the company is caught, it must be closed."
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, driving a Sheba can be considered a crime.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including a regular order, is not breaking the law," says a senior police officer, "whoever knows he is a Sheva driver, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hiding spots, including dropping them off in hidden spots.
For the most part, these guys drive with a car from Chokmak because they know that their car will be stolen, so they prefer to drive in an old car."

"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": the Haifa city auditor makes serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The City Comptroller's report shows apparent concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political opponents: surveillance of employees and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations •
"The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation" •
No response was given from the Haifa municipality.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations, "at the expense of the public purse".
The Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal's report published yesterday (Tuesday) presents an alleged fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials of the municipality, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accountant's office Barlev & Co. and asked to perform an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to council member Sofi Nakash, and it was checked whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family are strictly kosher.
The auditor's report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control after the work of the accountant with whom Klish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.
This meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation arose in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.
At the conclusion of the report, the audit recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material is received detailing his work in each of the issues he reviewed.
In addition to this, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers", information shop, fish shop, investigative audit for the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.
A short time later, the spokesperson for the municipality, lawyer Yamit Klein, stated that the mayor herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.
"It was not commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what it is about," she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
The former municipal treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: "These despicable actions that were done to tarnish my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayers are a criminal offense."
City Council member Sophie Nakash in her response: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
The response of lawyer Sharit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: the evidence and the difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the use of the investigative audit consultant to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the council's company From the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Detz's response from the "Shomeri HaShef" association: "It seems that all the red lines have been crossed when a public authority sends private investigators to collect information against lawyers who represent an association that exposes corruption and at a time when the association is conducting public proceedings against the administration of the Haifa municipality."
Haifa municipality did not comment.
The Yehuda Barlev CPA office does not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm the activities of UNIFL in Lebanon"
The Minister of Defense participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation" •
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of al-Sayed in the captivity of Hamas: "A video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue" •
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the international cyber conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "Another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, the captive of Hamas in Gaza, which was released by the military wing of the terrorist organization: "Yesterday, a video was published with the purpose of extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas."
He also added that "the State of Israel is working in a variety of ways, and continues to turn over every stone in order to return the boys home.
As we said before - this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Blackmail attempts and consciousness exercises will not affect our position and conduct.'
He later revealed the joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran also operates its agents in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently the activity of the Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah was detected, in order to harm the activities of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This is by carrying out a cyber operation whose purpose was to steal materials on the deployment of UNIFL in the area, and use them by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon, and on the stability of Lebanon."
"Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, which operate against Israel and other countries," Gantz continued and said.
"The 'new couriers' are terrorists with a keyboard who are condemned like fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our crosshairs - and not only in the cyber dimension.
No attack against Israeli citizens will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the country that finances and sends them.
A cyber attack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and in other spaces."
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran leads cyber terrorism - and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Actions such as that of the Shahid Kawah unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations."
He also added that "in recent years we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility', and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines."
Gantz went on to indicate Israel's next goals in the face of the threats: "Our highest mission, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have made this issue one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We examine the building of the force all the time - both in terms of manpower, both in terms of training and in terms of tasks.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire defense system."
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded and called for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world against Iran is of great importance, also in the cyber dimension.
The same cooperations we are building in the region with Iran in aspects of defense against various threats - we are also expanding in the cyber dimension."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We foiled the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at this type of conference, he revealed that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
"Defending cyber threats is a central part of our activity.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to act to negate his capabilities," said the deputy commander of 8200 and added "this is how we sometimes also find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed."
As mentioned, this is how a threat to Israel's water systems and the attempts to poison Israel's citizens was revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and in the process we identified that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the USA.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We managed to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners."
Watch: This is how the police prepares to eliminate terrorists in a civilian population
The Jerusalem Police inaugurates a new facility "Assaf" that simulates a shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months •
Anti-terrorist guide of the Mageb surrounding Jerusalem: "The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground" •
A look at the "Assaf" facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists in a civilian population and shoot in motion.
"Israel Hayom" exposure: a glimpse of the "Assaf" facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The severe wave of attacks that occurred this year, with attacks in Beer Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that occurred at the beginning of April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a mob, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that would be used Train fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the training division of the police and the border guard.
These were entered into a competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders leading learning", in which each district is required to develop measures that will help improve the policing and fighting skills of the fighters, policemen and commanders.
As part of the competition, and as a response to the need for the MagB fighters to practice combat in shooting training on the move and in this type of descriptions, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor of the MagB surrounding Jerusalem, developed the "Assaf facility", which consists of a dynamic target, which is connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to guide
As their servant who guides the bearer to his death, he can practice the warrior standing before him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Guard soldiers have faced many attacks in which the perpetrator, a shooting operation, poses a threat while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
"Collection facility", in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the facility, was taken from the maintenance and cleaning area.
Using the facility, it is possible to simulate shooting on the move within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, dealing with a traffic stop, choosing a path of progress, carrying out selective shooting, including practicing preventing harm to those not involved.
Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in the learning and training of soldiers and policemen.
The development provides a relevant answer to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit in development compared to the relatively cheap production cost is a significant advantage for us in the competition."
The State Comptroller warns: "The Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats"
Matanyahu Engelman warned during the International Cyber Week about Israel's unpreparedness for hacker attacks •
"World War III will be a war of hackers, but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Mattaniho Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits his office conducts, significant deficiencies were found: "Last year, we performed penetration tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, hospitals and the Tax Authority's systems.
In the audits we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were performed by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the Central Election Commission's preparedness for cyber threats."
"We at the State Comptroller's Office undertake to continue to address this significant issue even more strongly, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
Aiming high: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
The choice of the Reds: "From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I am built to lead a big team" •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I want to be on the roster for EuroBasket" •
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what was under my control" •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the players of the Israeli team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the qualifiers for the 2023 World Championship (Thursday, 9:30 p.m. Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Hall.
At the same time as the intense training with the national team, Blazer was also dealing with his future last week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have peace of mind now that I have found a team," he tells Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with my family after we settled in the central area and it's not easy, but there are no more phones and from a professional point of view I'm much calmer."
You haven't been in the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to have fun in the team and I come with the attitude of contributing in whatever way I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the field.
Of course I would love to play, but when you get to the team, everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything for the team to succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need from me."
Now you are 14 players, and Dani Avdia will join the European Championship, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and maybe there will be other changes.
Have you set your goal to be on the roster for the championship?
"I would love to be on the field and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) played for the last two years in Maccabi Tel Aviv.
When the season ended it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites over Hapoel Holon.
Did you have other offers, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed a great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and suitable to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the group.
I talked to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I bring.
I have always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even with the crowd being against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of that."
Expand a little on your conversation with coach Džikić.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and attack and with the audience in the arena it can be successful."
I looked at your career and saw that you stay in each team for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can also stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Everywhere I go I like to connect and give my all, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem my phone never stopped ringing and beeping.
I received many messages that are already waiting for me.
So I believe that a good time awaits us."
Do you think in Jerusalem you could be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you summarize the two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional the whole way, and no matter how much I got - I always gave it my all.
I'm proud of the path I've taken in the last year, and now everyone goes their own way."
If it was up to you, would you want to stay at Maccabi?
"After the last year it was clear to both parties that we were going in the direction of separation, but that is part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was hurt a bit in minutes and my status dropped, although in the middle of the year I had a great time, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that it was less of a place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it."
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"They talked a lot about what happened in the semi-finals of the cup last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv - YM) 'That's what I'm here for,' so that's what I came to Jerusalem for - to win titles."

Now it turns out that if he does not continue in the capital, Hapoel Tel Aviv will try to sign him in its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club leaders decided not to exercise the option in Ratin Obasohn's contract for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
In the meantime, guard Raz Adam may be loaned to Ness Ziona City after he asked to leave the Reds in order to get more playing minutes.

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but was able to make amends with an equalizer 10 minutes later •
Later, the contact was sent off with a questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained with ten players following a red for the duty of Ido Levy (87)
Hapoel Jerusalem's professional staff counted the number of foreigners on the field in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their happiness, everything was fine, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the association's court.
Before the red that Hadida received, he managed to score an own goal and equalize to arrange a precious point for Ziv Arie.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkushchenko charged into the box, and the midfielder rose and hit back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0:1 to Hadhra who benefited from an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to correct and in a big way - Levkovic caught air and this time the midfielder hit the correct and exposed net.
1:1 at Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding in the direction of Marmentini.
Daniel Bar Natan decided on a dubious red and sent the midfielder straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the balance of power on the grass as well.
Recovery department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Lahemi's team scored a third victory in a row, this time particularly impressive •
Huber and Shuchman (15 21) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continues tonight (night) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 0:3 season balance in meetings between the two.
Since dropping to the last place, the team of Ariel Beit Lahemi already has three consecutive victories, and in fact it is a surprise only for those who did not see the game.
We haven't seen Holon this bad in a long time.
All this before the opening of the series against Besiktas in the play-in in the Champions Cup: only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for three-pointers in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening for all the team's players (with the exception of Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3 three-pointers), including the safe share Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in much better shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Shuchman (15 points 21).
The first came back to himself in the last period and the second came back to bloom and also amazed with a basket from three quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: the Israelis of Maccabi Tel Aviv saved Spropoulos
After a loss in the derby and the eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in the Clasico against Jerusalem - apparently, would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Yanis have to send a bouquet of flowers tonight?
to his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in the Arena •
And also: why the Yellow Club should change the 'Americanization strategy', and take a living example from the model of Ariel Beit HaLhami in Eilat
It's hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Yannis Spropoulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, and especially in front of the tight hug and the exchange of secrets with John DiBartholmau, who with his own hands saved the Greek coach his job, and possibly the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, to also lose in the Clasico to Jerusalem and walk away from it to three wins in the table?
This would have already ended the Israeli-Greek romance tonight.
So in the meantime, he is with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and in fact mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in their attack and ball movement habits.
The ball moved with passing, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbkin, demonstrably, left the work of concentration to Evans, dribbling very little, and mostly going over blocks and going for shots.
Although he scored very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilvkin contributed in defense, and above all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
Nevertheless, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to the old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 lead and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled himself to half a corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the the game
The trick is to continue playing drills and passing movements precisely in the clutch moments, and this must enter into the nature and DNA of the team.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water-suckers and towel-wavers at European games.
Tonight they scored more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi's top five scorers were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, the section has been screaming for a month that he must play more.
Scorer, morale, fighter under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
it is not enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Zezic's injury, and especially John Dee, who changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points in a 70:63 situation for Jerusalem.
Yanis has a complex relationship with Yeftah Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of risking a loss.
It also happens in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be the club's, regarding its Americanization strategy.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Debrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe was rejected by Maccabi.
And it happens because there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis in Maccabi, because of the club's informed and deep-rooted choice to base itself on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and will pressure the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax reduction.
It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star and eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (a star center and a super forward) next to Scotty and Zizic.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generate identification.
It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receive a tax break from the state for its quasi-representation in Europe.
The basketball association/league administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 in form, maximum three on the field at the same time.
Is it because of the continuous failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players' organization, what about you?
Is that what you sat for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain for less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so well.
With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only second in the junior teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Royna and Shuchman the warrior), she dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three foreigners, because there was such a run in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit HaLhami, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their best, everyone plays together, and all Israelis learn and improve their game.
The foreigners only supplement.
With Ben Carter and Casey Prather back from their knee injuries, this will be a formidable team.
A song I dreamed of Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after the 78:83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
About Ami Beaton's conversation in the dressing room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Žižić's injury and the management's approval of the purchase.
A great sense of relief is registered this morning (Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78:83 yesterday at the Arena against Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management personnel hugged coach Yanis Spropoulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Yeftah Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the other members of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last series of losses.
They too were afraid of defeat against the great rival that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Yanis in the dressing room," said Oz Blazer.
"We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We were really looking forward to it, also in the way we played.
We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us."
Before the game, the team manager Ami Biton entered the dressing room and gave exciting words to the players.
"His words had a great impact on how we went out and how we played on the floor," Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to interrupt the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Yannis told us that if we are free we will win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
Many eyes were on us and it was a feeling that the whole world was against us, I am proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around us and only look at ourselves."
Ante Zizic who injured his right knee during the last quarter was examined by the medical team in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will be clear how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
Apart from the firm support given by the management to Spropoulos and the professional team, at the meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager Nikola Vycic was given the green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add a quality acquisition soon.
Anthony Bennett was released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward who was selected first in the NBA draft was not able to acclimatize in a team from the capital •
At the club they said goodbye: "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us, we thank him for his time in Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was selected first in the NBA draft in 2013 by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and the player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on the release of the player's contract at the club," the club said, "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him only good and success."
Research states: Zoom meetings harm creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics in the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings •
The result: a virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box •
The leader of the research at Columbia University: "The visual focus on the screen harms the process of generating ideas" •
Nechama Forta: There is no harm to work productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the effect of meetings through video software on the creativity of the participants in them, compared to meetings held face to face.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity does suffer in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, assistant professor from Columbia University - was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The research itself began already in 2016 but received a big boost in the two years of the Corona, during which many employees moved to work from home.
"People in an in-person meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking," says Brooks.
"In a computer meeting, on the other hand, the concentration on maintaining eye contact with the others comes at the expense of the creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which hurts the broad and expansive idea generation process."
The space is shrinking.
In order to examine the results of the experiment and ascertain whether they would repeat themselves, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and once again in real life - on engineers who knew each other from a prior acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty members and students into two parts - in one, the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the second, they were asked to do this via a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide themselves in a similar way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who works on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help them create ideas, whereas in a video meeting, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When the people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, the research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outside.
There is no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush the employees back to the offices, the researchers point out that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor the people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the damage is focused only on creativity and not on the other forms of working in front of a computer."
Prof. Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
According to her, "There is a difference between mere creativity, such as new uses for frisbees (one of the research questions; AG) and work solutions.
It is also possible that when the employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or that they work from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also suggested future research in which such meetings would be interrupted for thinking and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, only for brainstorming meetings would employees return to work and as a general rule he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and not be happy, that's a bigger injury," he says.

"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday that he intends to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after the loss In the elections against the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.

By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decrease in the next 25 years •
The solution: proper management of the water reservoirs
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In a study, in which scientists from all science agencies in the world participated, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and fresh water sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The dismal research conclusions show that currently the rate of water consumption is doubling repeatedly in the last 10 years, while at the same time global warming causes a decrease in the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the completeness of the research data, 84% of the lands intended for agriculture in the world will experience a severe lack of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls for farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate changes and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the water evaporation process that will lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies in order to prevent their flow into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University was leaked online
Hackers who attacked the database of Bar Ilan University a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a financial ransom •
The threat was carried out and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information was published across the web by a network attacker known as Darkrypt who published a ransom demand from the university staff a few weeks ago and threatened that if he was not paid an unspecified amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
The estimates regarding the amount of money that the attacker demanded are that it is an amount that started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it increased and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty members are full of angry messages and the mess is celebrated there, when students are unable to log into their personal information systems and cannot perform routine student assignments.
The university sent out a message via e-mail in which it was reported about the attack that the academic institution underwent and that they are working intensively to reduce the damage, while detailing some of the information that was leaked to the network.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked and it was said there that the university carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.

We checked: What do the side effects after the corona vaccine say?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weak, feverish and tired after receiving the shot, while others do not •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is this a baseless rumor?
While more and more people are getting vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are not true.
Are the immune systems of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their systems are unable to fight a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of reactions to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of the primary medicine department at Moheded and a member of the advisory committee for the Epidemic Treatment Team, and reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, local pain, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system .
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign body into the system."
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies that are developed and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50-60% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong reactions were more protected."
"In the medical literature, there is no correlation between an immediate reaction and the level of the vaccine.
In some trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but since the public is vaccinated, they attribute the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see regarding vaccines in general - the attribution of phenomena that happen near the vaccine and are attributed to it."
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions differ.
"There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it is a strong reaction of the immune system."
Is it even possible to assess the strength of the immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who didn't sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from this, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People catch many viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone walks around with a weak immune system and isn't aware of it.
These are people who come for inquiries because of repeated incidents of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
Soon MRNA vaccines will appear in additional contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge that has been accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that an opening will be paved for other vaccines of this type.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for the treatment of oncological diseases, for example.
Their efficiency is that the substance stays in the body for a very short time - enters, does its action, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it received a serious boost following the very great need for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that an interval of three weeks between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that it is possible that after the third dose we will not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to a situation of vaccination every six months or that the third dose will give an interval bigger".
Thousands were injured: a serious breach of privacy on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
It is possible that your private information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and complete details about the trips you have made, has been disclosed •
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report submitted by Derech Eretz, operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred at the company, the Authority for the Protection of Privacy began an enforcement procedure.
As part of the event, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment site, which allowed the disclosure of a lot of information from the invoices of the member's customers, which were exposed for all to see.
Among other things, the customers' payment invoices were exposed over a considerable period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, the location of the vehicle, the dates of the trips and at what times.
On top of that, since Derech Eretz did not document the access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know precisely for what period of time unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the violation letter, which the Authority for the Protection of Privacy sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization has an obligation to carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update of the security measures accepted in the circumstances of the case, in accordance to the nature of the reservoir and its nature.
As a result, companies and organizations have the obligation to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to examine the changing risks and prepare for them.
Also, there is an obligation for companies and organizations to use an automatic documentation mechanism and training must be conducted for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the privacy protection (information security) regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the inspection, the authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations and also demanded that the company perform several corrective actions.
The Derech Eretz company, operator of Route 6 stated: "The matter was handled in accordance with the strictest requirements"
Travel warning to Istanbul: surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or date of flight
Good news for Israelis who ordered tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: the airlines will allow changing the flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and means "high threat level: do not come to this country and in the case of a stay you must leave the country as soon as possible".
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus stated that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning, i.e. before the date 13.6.22, to change the destination or the date of the flight they have.
This is by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: "Citizens of Israel should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am happy that major airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus responded to our request and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey due to the severe travel warning."

The skies of Saudi Arabia are approaching: the Israeli companies are preparing to increase lines to the east
The emerging conclusion for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: the airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
The largest airline in Israel is planning significant changes ahead of the arrival of US President Joe Biden in Israel.
As we published in "Israel Today", it is estimated that Biden will announce the granting of permission to Al Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to other destinations besides the United Arab Emirates.
The meaning of the emerging agreement is that you will be able to fly on shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To this end, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, and this in order to clear planes in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which the flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is a sizable Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be made: the Dreamliner planes that fly to Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 planes that fly to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using the Dreamliner planes.
So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to more destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that the Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exemption from isolation for the vaccinated and those recovering from non-red countries, the foreign tourists are returning.
Landers in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the obligation to isolate upon receiving a negative answer to the corona test •
Only after that did the ministry issue an official announcement stating that only travelers from orange countries were involved, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the announcement •
In addition: tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter Israel, and it is expected that many red destinations will be removed from the list.
At the peak of an epidemic - the end of isolation for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices this morning (Monday) to returnees to Israel, according to which they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative answer to the corona test they performed after landing in Israel.
These are also returnees from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
Only then did an official announcement come out from the Ministry of Health stating that starting tonight at midnight, January 4, 2022, whether vaccinated or recovering, the returnees from orange countries will undergo a PCR test in Israel and enter isolation for 24 hours or until receiving a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be enshrined in the decree of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for approval to the Health Committee of the Knesset.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or convalescents who have already returned to Israel from an orange state and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel, will end the isolation tonight at midnight and are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, travelers from red states reported that they also received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country, will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed starting on the 7th day after landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to remove most of the restrictions on flights and especially on those who are vaccinated comes a day before the High Court hearing submitted by the Association of Travel Ministries, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association.
At the hearing that will take place tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, while the one who backs them up in his opinion is Professor Itamar Grotto.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, the Interior, Tourism and Transportation agreed that starting Sunday, January 9, 2022, the entry of vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed - subject to filling out an online form ahead of time, performing a PCR or antigen test before immigration to the plane, performing a PCR test upon entering Israel followed by entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Foreigners who are not vaccinated/not recovering (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, with the exception of those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group schedule will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red states?
The committee for the classification of countries in the Ministry of Health recommends to the government that the following countries be removed from the list of red countries and transferred to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this point in the list of red countries: the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option that the Ministry of Health is considering is to exempt from isolation the vaccinated returning from red countries.
At the moment it is not clear if there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the instructions that may be received from the Ministry of Health on this issue.
No response has yet been received from the Ministry of Health.
The skies are beginning to open: the Ministry of Health is changing the restrictions on the gates of the country
Vaccinated persons returning from orange countries will be charged with 24-hour isolation
The countries USA, Turkey, Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates will be defined as red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were ordered to quarantine, along with a ban on the entry of tourists into Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Israel.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the obligation of isolation for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, anyone vaccinated or recovering according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange state - was required to be isolated for three days, subject to two corona tests.
Now, the isolation that the vaccinated and the convalescents returning from orange countries will have to go into is for 24 hours at most, or until the results of the corona tests are received after landing in Israel (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two corona tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country and if they returned from a red country.
A vaccinated or convalescing person who has returned from a red state must also be in full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to go through the government's approval, includes the USA, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average number of positives who entered the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of the total number of entrants, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among the patients from Turkey is fast, the rate of positive returns from Turkey is a little over 4%, so it was decided to include it also in the list of red countries.
The most prominent countries that will be removed from the list of red countries: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange state.
Even in this case, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Agencies, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court to cancel the restrictions on flights.
The country removed most of the restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
At the hearing that will be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The one who will support the position of the petitioners is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported the easing of everything related to the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: "Abolishing isolation for those who have been vaccinated returning from abroad and the return of tourism to those who have been vaccinated are the right and just thing at this time.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
Vaccination is the best answer to an epidemic, and as such - the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling lifestyle alongside the corona."

Almost every person these days has an "old" tablet or smartphone lying in a closet unused.
Only because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model was released, any device can be a Spotify player instead of a hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote control to operate devices at home and many other uses.
You don't have to be victims of consumer culture and you don't always have to be at the forefront of technology, with yet another truly useless gadget.
Data collection without analysis.
Too bad
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the centers of the requested cities) is worth, and how much the wages of the employees (minimum).
It is forbidden to privatize the Israel Post
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because how blind they are
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modiin...
There should be a NIS 5 package tax so that they don't just order nonsense for NIS and charge the mail
This mainly indicates the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to King Pakim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to go near the post office and hope that no letters will arrive from them and the hatred for the post office has led us to give up everything related to the possibility of mail.
good week.
Fire all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office - by a private company.
Arrogant employers and some of them are racist!
They talk differently on the phone and when they get to the interview their true face is revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Slave jobs
Everyone is invited to get to know real Judaism

It's amazing that she's still getting job offers, in her profession it's not obvious...
There is nothing like walking on the high road♥
Amazing family♥
A few years ago I had a dream to chain Esti Zakheim the cow on the head with her red boras.
Beautiful and talented!!
How did you win Shomer Shabbat?
A man devoted to his wife and children.
Insanely talented.
Looking forward to her performances
perfection :-))
You are a world champion!
Amazingly talented Inbal, good luck
You are stunning!!! :-)
Mazel Tov
Well done!!!!!
Love won!!!!
Mazel Tov!!!!
Not to worry is not for long.
It is currently useless
How do you know it's true love?
Back to each other after 20 years!!
And she is even older than him
And he is a rich and famous hunk
And in a few months he reported on the separation of powers.
There are women who can wake up every morning with a new husband.
It's a shame he didn't participate in Eurovision
Let's hope that maybe next year he will participate in his original song
That's where the big break will come
Instead of the arrogant egotist from the writer they brought and only shamelessly did
Where is this Timoni Greenberg from hahahaha!
Who is?!
Why does he appear on a news site??
This is not Guy Pines or the Zion of Nonsense Moses
Smells like a well-oiled and invited PR under the guise of an article by Kahl2 in a yard in the shekel that hides behind the name of the newspaper editor.
The joke is on us readers, the captive audience that escaped from the clutches of the poisonous Moses and is looking for an alternative
The song is not to my taste and the music video is also casual
lovely lovely lovely
What a talent!!!!
Want more and more from him
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small for him.
He will still break out abroad in a big way.
A clinical optometrist?!
Well, really, her "degree" does not hold in the country of origin....
Which sector is next in line?
Bibiists?
And corneal mapping the main thing they didn't mention.
Alec Clinical Optometrist.
Clinically on her own behalf.
Where will there be sirens?
War is coming, we are being prepared
And what will the Luomi battle do, what cruelty
Bennett Lapid and Gantz at the behest of Biden: get ready friends get ready....
Because they are the champions of champions!!
hahahahaha but don't worry, even when managers are screwed up and stupid, we have abilities above and beyond what is expected!!
True, and besides, our dimensions, like most, are screwed up.
The Home Front Command plays "pretend" games, because in amen time - that we don't know...
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everything else is right-wing.
Despite the nice talk - we haven't heard about the arrest of hackers, you prosecuted them
And in the last four election systems, was the election committee prepared for an attack?
Why not specify for example...
How many infiltration and disruption attempts were made and how many succeeded in penetrating the Election Commission in the last 3 years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of the more bizarre signings of Hapoel Jerusalem.
Good luck Oz.
You will always be part of Maccabi's dynasty...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
You all see blackness, only claims and tortures, classic armchair yams.
Baldwin is a social attack in the dressing room, so say players who played with him in both Greece and Spain!
Hollins was injured and did not play in the last games of the Red Star...
Hilliard was also injured and did not play for the last six months...
Heavy bets.
Maccabi lacks a star
What is it really about with Brown?
If he doesn't sign, Maccabi may be in trouble
What about Lorenzo Brown?
hahahahaha how does a loser fit like a glove for a group of......
Adam is a great player, the coach must give him more minutes, don't give him up, Hapoel needs a big squad, you must not give him up
No.
Bring in Andrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on the staff.
Those who really play
Much more suitable than Vilbkin for Maccabi Shanbanat.
You see there are professionals in Maccabi - Blatt and Ketch.
Perhaps Lar's personal abilities are still comparable to Scotty's, but he is a team player, and especially his game intelligence is much higher
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, so they will not be successful with all the stars that have been plucked from around the world
Who cares???
If you're already watching a game where 6 American players and 3 Israelis are for decoration, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game????
Puzzle until it connects, the league will be over
Good luck
Good column.
I liked.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he cannot be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and his use may also be incorrect, and he A result of the coach's fixations and templates.
A non-scoring blazer with all due respect...
Yeftah Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he ruins it too much
There used to be a bad game, but Sorkin and Blazer Dodi and Cohen today, well done.
Ido Ashad is a bum Holon fan who was given 500 NIS so he writes nonsense.
Not Federman in the picture.
Blazer, Sorkin and Gek Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor in Europe who play for about twenty minutes and are unable to score a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, it is much better for the Israelis to play.
It's good that there is a good spirit for everyone, coach players and management in the momentum pull
Depends on increasing the internal buffering...
and disciplinary and required strengthening of a coordinator and guard
And that is the management part.
Not true.
The immediate human interaction is important in many ways.
The answer to this research is that social isolation is a bad thing from the professional aspect as well and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the zoom camera and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in another 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail
The scientists are not interested in warming or rainwater
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They are working on more and more vaccines and crappy methods to destroy the world's population so they tell us foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they invent
There is no problem with drinking water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the leftists are against their countries, and in all religions that believe in gods - among the stupid, the ignorant, the lame, the blind, or in short - among the herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living things (including sesmolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon.
The solution: Sesmolans, commit suicide!
it's green
good for the world
It will be better for you, and for sure the earth and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they conduct the research?
I don't believe any research that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist
He tends to control us and rob us of our liberty and freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as he did during the Corona virus.
I have never heard from him a presentation of facts from both sides, he always brings the side that serves the globalists.
We are being bullied.
Just burning money on academic "engraving" studies.
As usual, another carving from the land of the carvings of the psychopathic Sesmolans.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For hundreds of years the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, started a huge war project in the Gobi desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis are doing the same and they are also successful (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the Sesmolans' stupid "climate crisis" (emissions of carbon dioxide, which is needed by plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the Sesmolans' agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists don't care.
With them, the urine rises straight to the head and thus they do not dry out.
Does proper management of the water reservoirs mean a cut of at least 70% of the world's population?
It's surprising that COVID came and it's surprising that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose consequences for a period of 5-25 years on those who are injected are not known at all.
It's also surprising that Agenda 2030 is being launched and now this?
The whole story is really puzzling!!!
Hahaha what bullshit.
Tales of a thousand and one nights, all intimidation and of course nonsense of the left that tries to control the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said that it didn't rain anymore in Israel and the drought is permanent and here it is raining.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altlana and that Peres did not know that the children of Yemen were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan of course did not loot antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not mess with his female soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting bullshit.
Let them also take care of reception in the hubs, handling the power outages and voltage drops and we are on the wave
"This is real Zionism" just as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the swindler Bennett, the other crooked politicians will draw a line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not going anywhere near El Al, rather "Nel Al"
It was very pleasant, hello and goodbye.
You won't see us in your dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are held captive by the Elal company, all direct flights are in the hands of price pigs, it's better that you go bankrupt already, it's time for truly open skies. 4
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Elel to fly over its territory, then it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from Ashdod and Haifa ports through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, tourism, allowing Israeli beverage companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than 30 planes a week that will save an hour each.
It is more important that they let the Air Force squadrons be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and that they organize the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another air force squadron to be stationed in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less dense area.
After we finish with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoro Islands into a peace agreement with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries that joined the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the government in Qatar and finally eliminate this country's subversion, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these shared interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more Elel flights if at all Elel survives until then.
El Al should be closed.
Selling tickets for flights that do not take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
"No customer service".
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel forgets about it, a sure loss.
you have been warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, they prefer to fly abroad
Arkake turned from a hell of a company into a hell of a company
El Al also dropped in level.
The best thing is to order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you claimed by train to the field
40 Euros for a suitcase in Ryanair is much cheaper than Wiz.
You can carry an 8 kg backpack.
Why are you misleading?
Wiz Air charges much more for cargo and landing!!!
One big rant
Just for example, I just came back if I had to
The allowed weight is 30 kg
and a 7 kg trolley
And every additional 1 kg is $30
Go get updated
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it is a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
Lucky that the companies don't ask us to come to the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there is no weight on the plane.
In El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using a successful method.
A land eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this must be added genetic avarice.
Shame also on our country that allows foreign airlines to harass the Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as they please
So what did you learn today that it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket..
Prepared a surprise for all of us..
You will pay extras for the wheels of the plane, for the windows, for the luggage that does not arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and they will surely add on the toilets
In short, leave it at home and the prices will drop..
Or big, you will go out in ships
A journey will take several days
Pick up and you will probably arrive
Bennett wants to test how much he can attack and hurt Israel, and still win the recognition and support of his new fans.
open now?
It's not by chance.
Precisely when the rush starts there is an exemption, it's just crazy what's happening here...
This is not the peak of the epidemic
Shimon, it doesn't suit you
The number of confirmed cases increases does not mean that the number of patients increases
Stop being tested for any nonsense, stay at home if you don't feel well
The story is over
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennet are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And mostly stupidity
and public confusion score 0
Just more harm than good
I suggest you open a new corner: "The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and pictures behind the default."
Your ratings will soar.
You do not understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers
They bring another infection
They are not interested in the people
8500 have died so far
Does anyone talk about it?
They bury us, especially the elderly
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state coffers to make the ministers grow their stomachs and buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the Omicron stay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a nation, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange state, he is statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I see logical steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone really sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all sections).
The dream government at its best:
Minister of Finance telling the road guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, rushing to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education Machishasha tweets at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and sets her own policy, which puts all the schools into complete chaos!
A foreign minister, a clown who comes sick with corona to a government meeting.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we have had in the country, does not control the situation and loses his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership and without direction, in which the entire people of Israel have lost confidence
Go home and be nice one hour earlier!!!
My opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place but from a place of loss of control
Now the apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the forecasters?
Build a bus station and believe that it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for sponsorship fees after.
If they discover the exorbitant property tax prices of Arad, the hotel will once again be a white elephant like its predecessor
looks amazing.
Best of luck.
I feel like.
What about the art of posing completely naked?
Gives up the garbage
A serious fight for Sde Berir
Mashesthet Harvant Why are benefits not given to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of Mashesht Harbant
Everyone is a joker
In the current reality, is the south still ours?!
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the members of the Knesset will be there too!!
What about a popular hotel for a popular person?
All the best for investments in the [flourishing] South
Arad is developing and prospering, and kudos to the mayor who, since the beginning of his term, has experienced an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more on the height
Just an excellent mayor who improved the city!
Well done
I wonder how much sponsorship fees for the Bedouin will be paid by the resort owner.
Have you prepared money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Those who can only afford Al Super-a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When would it be possible to fly to Dubai, do you know????
El Al Pah Company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, informed the passengers to leave a message on W.App or Messenger and we will return, come back after a day or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to land planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there other suckers flying to Alal?
Didn't fly with them even for free.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took captive?
easyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
El on one way 560 dollars.
From the religious cheater who controls the company together with his screwed up son I don't buy even for 10 dollars, non-stop cheaters...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be plus the price change.
Those who buy tickets at Elel put their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin company.
Low cost company exercises.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all the members of the "Goelicia"...Ali!
Nature dilutes fools!!
