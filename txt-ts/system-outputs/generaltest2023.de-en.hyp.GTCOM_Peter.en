Diego Cocca becomes new Mexico coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after Qatar's early World Cup exit. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blooms on" also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Fishing. "Geesthacht blooms" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthach urban area flower islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out in January to seek food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He has hives on the property himself.
So that the endeavor not only remains an action of conservationists and the specialist service environment of the city, but draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels are repeatedly placed to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way, which blooms so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhazel
More recently, shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball are found in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first tender flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been considered with further signs. "The winter-scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can become between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there under further information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that but not only the bedding plants now show flowers. In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lush on the directional path at the slope, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 pm for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102. Birthday.
For the native Munich (15. January 1921) von der Schwanthaler Höh "is the Monday THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, I can't imagine without it."
With Ernestine Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs.
The 97-year-old is recovered in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today you would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the round of tap dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: The tap dance was performed in the 19th century. Century developed in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during dancing, which fit the optical impression and the music. The dancer also becomes a percussionist musician. The English expression is Tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco might have influenced the tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, with us big and small, old and young welcome."
And what's the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sports, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalization progresses, the desire for analog is growing again for so many
The speed with which our everyday life became digital hardly allowed us time to set rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one was one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or one was one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and there for a bottle of Radeberger with the relatives on the phone. Or you looked up a telephone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the Plastehörer and the click of the change coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
How to continue in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisers.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure., as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "tremendous sacrifice."
Moldova is a neighbour of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau parliament, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with Kremlin support - have become more popular.
These were the celebs' costumes

Oberhof: Bold eighth in World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on the ground as a TV pundit, is still an undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it had already been enough with Norway's mixed season for the successful title defense.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the chase, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate shooting errors to a certain extent frighteningly easily.
Meanwhile, nothing went together again with Doll. After the veteran had given away all chances of a medal in the opener with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things did not go better three days later. Three penalties already in lying down shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in 2017 in this discipline.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with 0.7 seconds advantage razor-thin over Bö. It was one of only three career successes in total Dolls, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic Eighth of Beijing pulled away without a word after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is all about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
Us President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been tested," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the heart of our strength." Lula responded with regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On 1. In January, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital, Brasília, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is reminiscent of the storm on the US Capitol more than two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his predecessor, Trump.
Short note on the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? They saw the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, such a public mood was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's call it late capitalist society. (Here nothing to the really dangerous in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise rather after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is ill-informed, because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) If Ms. Wagenknecht stands, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this sheet anymore. If it does, it would be high time now. We've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below it anymore.
And at least now, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, ie peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This confirmed Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: 'I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has made an application to the competent court to have his civil partnership revoked. I don't comment on details. "
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke on the RTL show about marital problems.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial centre was set up in 1999 in the ruined village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for German-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, sometimes 300 motorcycles per day roar the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup long - and some also right back.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate increases in the fight against the high inflation rate "absolutely" necessary. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and even China's opening-up can give prices a temporary boost, "Sewing told the" Welt am Sonntag. "
The European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth year in a row in early February and another 0.5 percentage point increase for the 16th meeting. March in prospect. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high rates of inflation. At the same time, higher lending rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro states, such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep this in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
In the medium term, the ECB aims for price stability in the euro area at an inflation rate of two percent. That target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of ​ ​ the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply higher energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federation of German Banks (BdB). "In this I currently see the greatest danger for the German economy. But I'm optimistic that we can avoid that scenario. "
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And he may also be a bit more controversial, "he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to some extent because of the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany tempo." In addition, the Federal Government had recently brought an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines on the way.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and put the neighbor against his will a wind wheel in the garden, "said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, which one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and did not make it. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was right. Maybe we've overdone it with the rulebook and made it too complicated. "
However, given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of Bayer group smashing
The chemical union IG BCE warns after an announced change of boss at Bayer before a smashing of the group. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three legs is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk spreading and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced on Thursday change of chief at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals company. Controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has long been criticized. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen had brought expensive lawsuits over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate in the house. The Bayer share was in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to grant discharge to the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which should actually run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on them. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also joined in. Bluebell insists, according to a media report on a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to go back against the planned pension reform on the street.
To a government project, the unions oppose the concentrated protest on the street. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected nationwide on Saturday to demonstrate against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the centre-government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in Parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France work longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a no-deductible pension when they reach the age limit. In many exhausting jobs, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-earned pension and not completely wear out their health in the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population must work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations, calling for the state to find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But not only at the retirement age, the government wants to screw. The increase in the necessary deposit period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, should be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was canceled, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were all certain.
With Macron's camp no longer having an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of conservative Républicains, which have announced support. However, some of the Members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's worry about crippling strikes at the moment. Before Saturday's renewed demonstrations, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they went quietly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful area of high pressure lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does that mean there is likely to be plenty of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches the eye over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high is shifting a bit eastward over the course of the next week. But it continues to determine the weather in Germany. "
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands for days dreary high fog gray, while in the highlands of the low mountains there is pure sun."
So the Sunday starts in most regions foggy-cloudy. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can also rain a bit, according to DWD. Above all on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun comes out more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily overcast or highly mist-like. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually stronger sun nibbles again at the high fog and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist. At the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere she must first fight through the high fog cover. The maximum values ​ ​ are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, however, only 3 degrees are expected. In addition, weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, there can be in some lowlands again only tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, according to forecasts, the sun shines all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator quarrels: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
Beaten top favourite Sofia Goggia has revealed her deep disappointment following her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not bring the performance I can," said the Italian on ZDF, after threading at a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old could just prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races of the season so far in this discipline. After gold 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, must continue to wait for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She was absent from her home game at Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
'I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second, "said Goggia after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel now. 'I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life. " Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the expected and ultimately missed medal of all experts: "But they are not."

Selenskyj and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With calls for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed on a joint conference call to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, said the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinenė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. 'and I've made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now make a joint statement on this subject. "
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He posted his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not portable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because it provides military bases for attacks to Russian troops. Selenskyj called on the officials to work for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "sadly lost its honesty."
The occasion of the conference was the IOC's announcement that athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, said afterwards that it had also confirmed in the discussions to reject a start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "There is no reason, in our view, to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competition. Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's ambition to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way to go, "said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry on dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "The sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against Ukrainian civilians. Big sporting events don't take place in a vacuum. " Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly subscribe to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.

Half of vehicles lost?: Us sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? Us sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
The Pentagon reckons Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. We are talking about "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Presumably half of the main stockpile of tanks" of the Russian army was "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, secretary of state for international security issues at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed by the US assessment at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks for March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, your delivery will take much longer in all likelihood.
Russia wants to refill
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has begged abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now vice-chief of the Russian Security Council, on a visit to an armored factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "Clearly, in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a greater alignment of the economy to the needs of the army. Thus, for example, individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Vortex for post occupation at Heer
Because the post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously unfilled job, said the minister. "Speculation of a liberal staff representative" she did not want to comment. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. These are cleared out from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability for content. This is an expert for the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands information from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." At the decision is the "appearance of Postenschacher," says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, among other things, for security in Wasungen are difficult to cope with, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, there are no carnival parades. The "train of happy people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. Also at the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht no moves were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are going through our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the previous more contributed, reserves would have to be touched - "that does not work every year." The deficit currently: About 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: In the confectionery there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Luck in misfortune had ordered too much in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. Nevertheless, it is already clear for the move that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as much staff is needed as in 2020.
Anyone who stands by the wayside on the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have that much with them. Camels or not, the influx of visitors should be great: "I believe that if it should not rain from pots on the day, then we can certainly expect an increased influx of people," says the Cologne train conductor Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that two years just did not take place a regular Rosenmontagszug. There's nothing to replace the train, of course. "
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. The train is generally "loss-making," that's no secret.
Ukraine Diary: Dreams and self-baked vodka
Ukrainians are not considered safe to drink for nothing. There is local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same goes for the vodka, which is widespread. They burn here above all on the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here just how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that one should be careful as a tourist with it. But that's only true if he goes into mass sales. There is probably also adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer after work, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweeper master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint of Oberhof. But there were two glimpses of light in the fog.
As much as the Federal President also made an effort, from the VIP stand on Saturday was not to recognize whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely affected the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he revealed and praised Oberhof also for its modernized sports facilities: "The retreaded arena is great and offers ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded. " Also in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades."
Athletically, once again the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö escaped the competition. Despite a penalty after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23: 21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1 / 43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the battle for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1: 04.8 minutes as best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1: 14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed use on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five discs this time and disappeared as 55th deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However: In his last two standing shots he had the luck of the good guy; they each landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year older brother: "It is the best feeling to stand with him here," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the finest athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. For the women, on the other hand, the German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. 'if you start at number one, the goal isn't to come in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one, "took sports director Felix Bitterling his" locomotive "in the duty. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 clock / ZDF and Eurosport live) an almost sold out arena.
Brych dislikes'swarm of bees' on court
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on refereeing ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanship. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in togetherness on the pitch. "I think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to that again - and we will sanction it. "
Recently, two coaches had been considered with place references. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "Even the coaching behavior falls into the area of ​ ​ unsportsmanship. We noticed that unsportsmanship has increased in this area as well, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. Even such unsportsmanship we want to punish consistently, "said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a basically good togetherness of coaches and impartial. "Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlash. That's what the person concerned has to live with. That should not be anything earth-shattering, "said Fröhlich the German Press Agency.
"From the emotionality can arise in the course of the game quite conflicts. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal vilification, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by referees, "said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the participants would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a rethinking process were to start altogether that such a behavior just does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always color off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviors, "said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent rule interpretation in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combine Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country race of the Norwegians Jens Luraas Oftebro before the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves of Estonia.
The German combined drivers do not compete in the Black Forest in best numbers. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not included. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from the 21st. February to 5. March in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that, "said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.

Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about building defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible building defects after building collapses during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused should be responsible for building defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor in Adana also investigates, according to Anadolu, because of possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
By early Monday morning, a magnitude-7.7 quake had shaken the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude-7.6 quake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing group in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old had died in the night of Saturday. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing group in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses "a significant personality," said the group leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first. Secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on the 13th. November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammerwahlen on 18. In March 1990, the SED / PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He followed as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
"Until old age he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was just a special merit of him. That will remain his political legacy, "Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It also states:
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS was always to represent also that part of the former GDR population, which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly injured."
After reunification Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As it says in a report of the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow has seen the new state "quite critical." German unity had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had sunk too unconditionally, and too one-sided it had been condemned as an "injustice state," Modrow criticized according to dpa in many interviews.
What happened at night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian rocket attacks. However, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy network. But Ukraine, too, is attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, said the head of the utility Ukrererho, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. It looks particularly bad with the power supply in the Kharkiv area. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at Khmelnytsky nuclear power station had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was cut back.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj doesn't want to abandon small town of Bachmut
On 24. February will rule war for a year. Us President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine backer Poland just before the anniversary. The danger of Russian rocket attacks, however, also lasted in the night to Saturday. In the capital Kiev, air alarms were triggered late on Friday evening for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," said the military administration of Kiev area. Fighting drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas of the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects consultant for network company
Demands, among others, the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them, failed at the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be in the future public interest. This means that it does not need to generate and pay off profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The rehabilitation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this maladministration with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments needed to achieve this have so far been estimated at EUR 50 billion. According to recent calculations of the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
World Biathlon Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She would have slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited," the pulse did not come down when running in. "Such a race," and that at the home World Cup, "you can not describe that in words," she said. 11,000 spectators whooped to the booming pop music with Germany flags, caregivers and team fell in the arms.
"Enjoy biathlon," that's what she had planned to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started as the biggest, if not the only German medal hope away from the squadrons in the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick has become the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And even if the power density in the women in the top is significantly higher than in the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, they had for this sprint victory but rather others on the slip.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators calling for Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. The protests killed more than 350 people in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry demands more orders from special assets
First armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, other projects threaten the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. Which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms, but can not yet be said. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at the present time," it says in a response of the Federal Government to a request of the Bundestag MP Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
Background of the falling investment amount are the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans themselves. If these rise, so less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the currently high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1: 40 clock, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left at the highway entrance Kupperzell in the direction Heilbronn on the highway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, police said. During the turn-off process of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both accident participants said that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A review of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be hospitalized. The two cars were damaged by a total of about 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates victims of earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of Feuerbach's Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Stuttgart's Schlossplatz, more than 200 people commemorated and prayed for the victims on Friday evening.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam Allah asked for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. Speakers expressed sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already come together in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat plant - Ebersberg
"After the meal you shall rest or take a thousand steps." The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because who thanks to home office not in the middle of a stone desert, but rather only a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk to the fresh air. At least one could gain this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 14 clock not only dog owners frolic.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature from the long-unseen neighbor news from the settlement? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It was also possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with tax advisor, lawyer or investment adviser can not take place outdoors? Unless there are foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done well is the acquisition of natural materials. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to cheese on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you do not think about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voice. "Too bad, we have unfortunately forgotten the money."
The disappointment can be felt, because you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you let the sympathetic chance acquaintance also know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You certainly have a bag with you! " He points to the hood of the jacket, which has been thrown over quickly before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat inlay and on this midday short trip has become richer not only by a lamb back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk is due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road in the direction of Hailfingen and came from a previously unexplained cause in a left turn to the right of the road, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a control post, crashed into a tree at the side and stopped a few meters away. The collision caused the driver to become trapped in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. Emergency services took the seriously injured man to a hospital. As there was a suspicion of driving incompetence, a blood sample was ordered. At the Audi, according to police report total damage in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the US
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the Ministry said in the decision on Friday.
Contrary to political practice in the US, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought back to the high court against a release. A prosecutor in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The issue to Congress is arguably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of access rights is slightly larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be released in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is constantly coming out of Parliament.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and about their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi stated.

British felon caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug criminal has been caught in Thailand. As the British Criminal Police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled, according to authorities in early 2018 before the start of a court case, in which he had been sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. This fits in with the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again." Whether this fits in well in the generally prevailing domestic science skepticism here is an open question. In any case, his humor fits very well with Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian in 2019 for a year. But now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it knows - and above all what not. Of course, Corona also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many are pushing ahead: What really matters? All this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so are not only well entertained, but can also learn something.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device Battlezone is equipped with a vector or X / Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of an armored driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock cuboids, which provide temporary protection to the player, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. These can't attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score with a UFO hit. The Battlezone device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the Attraction Procedure, the Game Introduction Procedure, Play Abl on, the Initial Input for Maximum Results and the Self-Test Procedure. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the pressure switch START is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the sound of the game becomes audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by observing the text displayed in the upper left corner of his cockpit. For example, a hint may be: Opponent OF THE RIGHT. In addition, a point representing the enemy position is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The top, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he must be well targeted on the screen. In addition, the upper left display shows simultaneously the EGNER IN the fire area.
Temporarily, UFO's that fly over the battlefield become visible on the screen. These are safe missiles that observe combat and can eliminate neither the opponent nor the player tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the fighting and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the opponent tank. A shot down by the player brings that 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: 1,000 for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 for a rocket and 3,000 for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the player the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. In addition, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket can be varied. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option are shown in the figure.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of maximum scores, HE or YOU can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, batifying the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are received with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Each score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his / her pder initials within 60 seconds, strokes are automatically written by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. Assembly
1. New Parts
The Battlezone device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer casing part, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper function of the switch contacts. Another change is the rubber centring bellows, which, like a centring spring, brings the control lever back and forth to the center position. The microshawls are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. Atari'S X / Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and calm image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the extension of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. In addition, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players, so as to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Equipment inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Still, you should do some checking to round out the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be made: Note: Device not yet connected to the 220 V mains. A. Check the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wire harness connectors for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs with each other.
Note: Never forcibly establish plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A plug connection twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and fixed fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the unit. Check that the die-in production number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC PCB, Controller / Audio II PC board and TV monitor. A picture of the location of the production number can be found on the back of the cover page of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your specialist dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as power supply, control console and TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. A view through the player's sight glass shall be taken to check that the radar screen is also located in the bright orange circled opening of the cover. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cladding, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector connector on the PSU 1 (s. Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
Any PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Using the DirectX Diagnostic Program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX diagnostic program, please do the following: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text box. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound work properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are started automatically when the system starts up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called "background applications." In some cases, they may cause your program to hang or crash. This is why we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If your system is running antivirus or crash guard programs, you should close or disable them before starting your game. To do this, locate the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close," or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also quit general background applications, as these sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to exit all unnecessary background applications." Cleaning up the system
Before you install software, you need to make sure that your hard drive works optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to make it all work properly. Then the chances are great that current games on your PC run largely without problems. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus also other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to access the ScanDisk and ScanDisk tools. To inform error checking, defragmentation and disk cleaning. Using the Windows Help
1. Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or. "Help and Support") to call the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. B. "Scandisk" (Win 98 / ME), "Error Checking" (win 2000 / XP) and "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup." You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. So you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturer:

Introductory WORDS ON DRIVING
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I came like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century. On the one hand, although I struggled with the still immature technique, on the other hand, I was aware that everything still needed to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years couldn't quench my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games exploited only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience world: The sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expressing feelings. Although this could, of course, have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting vile monsters in dark corridors and balling on boxes to get ammunition, but has far more sophisticated and deeper content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer a game content without sacrificing the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. Should you be more skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your attitude toward that. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled much of our lives, representing an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, which has forced us time and again to challenge many of the principles previously deemed incontrovertible. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass by without a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. Try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering Sparx. The game is set so that a minimum required area must be occupied before you can start the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed Sparx are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional Sparx are released. In case of alarm, the Sparx become SUPER-Spartix and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marker goes into a spiral of death, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross or return your own path. If you hesitate and don't complete your area, a fuse will be plugged in and your mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are available.
The QIX game is able to self-check, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work properly. For more information, see "Service Program." The volume can be made at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data / Sound PC board.

Service-PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set with the help of the "Sub-Test" button. If the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment-Programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can set a "maximum number of credits," which may be before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" button. By multiple pressure on the "sub-test" switch, the factory or If the lowest line (RESET line) is green, press the "Up" button. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate until now." This value determines the required number of points / hits that a player needs to enter his / her own initials (names) and the hit points on the screen. The "maximum number of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, - if coin lock exists - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be placed so close to 99, so by throwing in a coin the credits cannot become zero if added over 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Loans" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of marks per credit
"Threshold": Height of the% number that must be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty of the game process
"Tightening tone": At "0" no sound at stationary operation
For "1" sound even when stationary (animating sound) "table model": For "0" stand-up device
At "1" table equipment
The credits per coin are set on the "throw-in slot programming" display. High score program display (maximum hit rate so far "). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the 10 next scores. The values are used to set the highscore that was selected on the previous display (setting from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX Standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation." By pressing the "Up" button you can set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts over. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or plug connection W1 is removed, if the device is turned off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (Not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of loans given for eigwerfene (umgwertete Münzen). Loans granted: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Spins: Loans granted (Paid + Loans granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, for extended or won play. % free time: Minutes won / minutes played per 100. Average playing time in sec: Minutes played / credits paid + credits granted
High score: Number where a player had enough high scores to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming / normal money setting. With the help of this display, the selector can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If you want a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After a single pressure, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not suitable. Once the setting is done, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting will appear. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switches. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus loan is issued. "Min coin" means a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0." CMOS MEMORY (Memory) CALL
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, which stores all programming, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably indicates battery failure or failure.
Troubleshooting and SETTINGS
Start of test method. Print the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test 'button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can start. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed. If a permanent test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 plug is removed, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checktotal stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the ROM checksum is incorrect, U 10 will be displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. Led value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the above mentioned. Display holds, an error has been discovered. If the communication RAM fails during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Failure in U 3, U 4 or connected circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations will be set to their previous value. Led value: 00 0011 If the device with the above mentioned. Display holds, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits and decoding respectively.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy when read back. Led value: 00 0100 There is an error when this value is displayed. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrolments are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, notice the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), the next check will be started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor shall be in place and it shall be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for star No 1. The 2nd for the right jacket to arrive without any visible seam defects. But I guess I was looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented me on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in my bust in an S or M. In the end, she would have fit in length and at the hip. In the rest, I could swim. In addition, the feed material already met when opening the package and distributed everywhere. Just a pity. It will be returned: /
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my mistake. Have then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and you do not damage the edges anymore. You can use the groove or the whole area. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy again right away.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I'm okay, but not under a year. Because the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We brought him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him for greatness. Now at 12 months old we've been looking for him back out and he can use him. Has also not been able to bite on anything with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / unfortunately goes back
I have let myself be dazzled here by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can not say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at far higher prices. Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it would be, but there can be no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not provide such protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more laborious. Overall, the haptics of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro. Also the rice closures and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. So I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Quality seems to come at a price. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that I've had a hard time making the decision either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked a lot is the color inside. Here you will certainly find his things much faster than with a gray inner life. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the electric series of E. L. Todd best liked, however, my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and had really been looking forward to the third part. The part goes all the time around the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and is then in every dispute like a little child and warps?! At the same time there were disagreements, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand on him and try to convince the ex that Taylor could not without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that was the last part of the series and I think that part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that finally comes out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more tension back to history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do so! First of all, the film is not sooo bad now, as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and conceptualized again and again according to the same schema F. When you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn to do so! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I thought about the film (and although I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot you tears in the eyes. That's why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already really neat. It's just a pity that humans just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We consistently destroy the animal and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves to do so. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: No indication. 4 stars, because the film is well done, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - besides, it is quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and do not expect anything from it that he does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that does not matter. 5 Days every morning a parcel: Nothing has moved, but nothing is pure. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times daily. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate weaning, diarrhoea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5? That is very strange!
Terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February / March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed directly that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a roughly chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the manual even with not satisfied result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first try. Worst of all, it still stung weeks after application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't disappear.
Highly Recommended
I now take the tablets for a long time and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of my work, too little exercise and even a longer additional illness. Since I wanted to help my immune system not only by healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 something on the jumps. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and substantially more comfortable. I better sleep and get out of bed. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not quite perfect!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems over time to "connect" to the mobile phone. This means that the "Power On / Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new deficiency. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it loosens itself from the cover, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore, for the cost of 30 €, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I do not know how all this good evaluation comes about. In the end, it is actually an eyeglass cleaning cloth, which you get with every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is really very thin. Since I have used it I can not exchange it unfortunately I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far exceeded more than 2 euros one should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I shcon fell into the shower), gives bass as bass again, Bluetooth works great. Of course, you have to water suction cup, otherwise it will loose. it can play sound very loudly. Yes. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played back very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the song are already almost hurting in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are grade enough audible. My old speaker didn't play bass well as bass, but the frequencies were pretty natural in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to pull off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
At a few places the color was chipped off and if you just went over it with your hand, the color went off to some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we did not want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our cost. they would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did it all for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Supplied are individual parts which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't fault it as I desperately needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not get hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything is glued together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closing + beautiful optics + stable when set up + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors pop through magnets (you may be able to compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no other and did not have them since there was no cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the mounts for the inlay shelf shake something (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If he would not look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give less stars, since you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. In addition, I find him a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes me.but
.There are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have forgiven 5 *. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed s.photo) means for me a star trigger. I hope the manufacturer changes this and will soon collect full points.
Go to the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: The natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't turn them down, either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me too, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time comes and the sunrise simulation started, it was too bright for me immediately. The colors and also the color change I found nice, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that he has a battery so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the wake-up time do not have to be re-entered. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, processing insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a board laughs at me at this point. There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled that coolly and quickly, but I did not realize that until after the return deadline. So I see that as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light in itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very bright and evenly. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry etc. For living rooms, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too and maybe I get there also intact copies according to the order. If my evaluation is helpful, I am happy about a positive evaluation. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I thought for a long time whether I order this set, or not. * * The material is stable and it lies well in the hand. * * All the utensils have a hole on the handle to hang them * * The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. * * They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. * * You also do not forward the heat and thus can be touched directly. * * However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe and they're gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, tap unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have had to detect considerable scratches, abrasions. The fittings / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chromed faucet itself scratch marks / streaks can be seen. This part has probably been delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it does not matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather spend something more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. Just find it sad that customers are so screwed up!!!
Product in itself top, outside sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, there are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values ​ ​ outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, here plausible values are still displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because there are always completely astronomical values ​ ​ of the outside air humidity displayed. This is a pity, because the device was placed on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt of delivery stand today still blithely drives Hermes through the republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived at me quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cut picture. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a big shortcoming. For one thing, it's only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, and fabric in between. If you drop it off completely only briefly, then of course it is compressed and parts of the content fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows already at half full catch basket on red. That would not be so bad if the mower did not lose large parts of the cutting material from then on. Always emptying the basket with a large lawn area when it is half full can not be the solution now. So I cleaned the device as well as I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, which is unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the fishing basket.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly constructed. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save the battery. For the following reasons I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed quite fiddly again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened nevertheless the hotbed is still too high and in the front right the screw falls almost out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hot bed is nevertheless still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight as well as the table too. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because that makes it impossible to print something out. To set up: The setup was quite trouble-free you could only show how to lay the cables because you otherwise have to reinstall them several times, which is very hard. I have already written support but after a week of waiting I still did not get an answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. Had expected me a little more.
Robust and precise I am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to come here. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so that you can start right away. The packing of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for it and believe he will last at least as long as the old caliper. From mit there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, durable smell
Bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being as it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it was constantly "aired." After return no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Rate from purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so it seems quite massive. The larger sphere is freely movable, which I find quite beautiful. However, the chain as a whole is very easy to work with, so I have already torn open the closure two times. So far I have been able to fix it again and again, but I think that will not last long. But for the cheap price you simply can not expect anything really high-quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't work out, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more cuddly. Only: If you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after a few players. if you stick to the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and had re-inserted, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all for me so not to use! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase anyway, brings only trouble!
Transport Damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I only bought them again for one reason, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft at the previous pump had a production failure and the current pump performs its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing cracked and the vents broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than using just a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
You could have thought better. Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first, everything went pretty well. However, the paint went off quite quickly and the screws always had to be pulled back. Nice that this also goes with a penny coin, but also only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: Attaching the keys. Nice is that you can use the different parts, the screw on different sizes respectively. Can set lengths, but if you have screwed the whole then first, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread is broken off during the third time mounting and thus the whole thing is useless. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks robust and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to assess the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can not really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag two smaller bags / bags were included. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and consists of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. The price - performance ratio I see as a tasting price and that's ok.
So Lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas too. Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't. Battery? Exchanged. But he still does not work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can as well.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. Battery life is long enough. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The earlobes are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price category.
Chic dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions. Price-performance is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would only have liked the neckline not to be so deep, and the sleeves could do with a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger away. It does not get any worse. I really and seriously didn't expect such a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It can be assumed that the USB connections provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are detected as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, then Rödel makes sounds like you have not heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because there is nothing left or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or just anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, there is of course no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it should, but is not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually eye candy, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge any devices and thus relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and had I just needed a grubby extension I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump of gold plugs. But apart from optics and my misjudgment, the extension performs its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So no real bad buy, but my euphoria is limited: -).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I had to send back unfortunately could not. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is supplied via HDMI. For what else do I use my PlayStation: P There was a small adapter with which can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, that doesn't fit with the adapter. Well keeps so safe and has contact from that. All in all somewhat expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and made stable in an aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
A lot of performance
Top device. Has been running without problems for months. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings neat performance. I find the central position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and am therefore always on stage 2 on the way. Has also fallen several times on the tile floor and has survived well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the tracking is felt to be accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump once by a few meters, which is not disturbing. Would buy me him again any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently he lasts about 1,5h days. Here a solution would be great which would create 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us and change daily we find also impractical. You should deal with the dog not with his collar: -). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education, the sole breaks after a few weeks and the shoes can not be used anymore. With the last couple it was also in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lesson it will be enough. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. Comfortably, they are just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly made and that the strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them for good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included. To the mattress: I have tested them in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that this one does not show up again. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It fits well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Before that, we took out the seats at the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The Air Pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters, which can also be found at the pump. The pump is put into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was broken (something at the soldering point). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in zero comma nix. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then curious about the endurance test at the festival. I hope that she will not lose any air and will last a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test, I can definitely recommend it before. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than €10. Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me.: (1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ludicrous processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On 21. There were no doors left at all and I had to allow more or less my son to take out the remaining parts because they almost already liked him. The parts often get mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car to install the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windshield. This can also be very badly reattached.) In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and make it better.:\
A real drone
I'm thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually enough. The hair gets jammed in it and the drone breaks very quickly, I did not expect anything else with the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. Nice contact if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but only a code with which to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impudence. Since then, the computer is constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's running time
I had been really looking forward to the clock. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed easily. Service worked well. and yet I send them back. DRR big hook: The battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, only on the closet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of news during the day, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore for, me not usable. Very bad.
Noble shell with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 + you should definitely get a cover. I recently liked cases in which you can also plug the credit card. This is what the case offers here. If you plug in all 3 compartments of cards, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. The mobile phone is embedded in contrast to many other cases around, only at the connections are recesses. Otherwise you can use on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the cover. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the cover. Even on the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO it does not work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be loaded when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well processed!
High quality shell with bulletproof glass foil
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily reared. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some hold. It's not too bulky and is firmly on the phone. Overall, a good buy.

Persistent cellular microchimerism could play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in maternal circulation and fetal cells in infested skin tissue in the form of Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences has been demonstrated.
The persistent microchimerism could trigger SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft versus host-like reaction.

Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not start until adulthood, then one speaks of Still's disease with the onset of adulthood ("adult onset still's disease").
Diagnostic criteria include a characteristic rash, joint discomfort, flare-ups and leucocytosis as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat with no detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen and missing titre for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a long time, whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.

The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnosis in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria should be required for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or a melanocytic nevus that is susceptible to differential diagnosis.
In the case of malignant melanoma, the prognostic relevant tumour parameters which are important for therapeutic treatment must be fully and uniformly recorded in the histopathological report.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in defenceless children pose a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Causally, infections with a variety of pathogens are possible, in the foreground are in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses.
In 25-30% of cases, however, respiratory symptoms are based on non-infectious causes.
Medical history, lung X-rays and blood tests are often of little help in finding a diagnosis.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the airways leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lava fluidity.
The flexible bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage results in a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%, the remaining cases must be diagnosed - with the appropriate clinic - by a mostly open lung biopsy.
The majority of women affected are younger to middle-aged.

We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical image of an imDe (type I).
The special interest of this case study is that there is no light dependence, which has also been shown by the fact that no deterioration has occurred during PUVA therapy.
It is likely that imDe is a special disease in the form of elastolytic diseases in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Using the pre- and postoperative computed tomograms (CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures supplied by USS (universal spine system), we conducted a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to verify the efficiency of direct reposition of posterior stenosing fragments under intraoperative, sonographic control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is further than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates a greater constriction.
In fractures without neurological signs of failure, fragment reposition promises to avoid late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there is evidence of ultrasound analgesia in patients with non-radicular back pain under serial administration depending on the prescribed power density (LD).
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult to replicate mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal part of the mandibula can also be successfully supplied by means of monocortical mini-plate osteo-synthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters describing the character of a mandibular fracture and additively forming a ranking value for the classification of trauma seems to be pioneering for a suitable differential indication between the two treatment concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations to describe mandible trauma that all previously applied studies with their low case numbers can at best enable a rough differential indication.
In the absence of a prospective multicentre study, which could provide a decision-making aid in the choice of the osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to functionally stable compression sosteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid range between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over and under-representation of DNA sections.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about genetic aberrations, a software was developed which enables the objective detection of the location and type of changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these studies is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms, thus achieving a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical procedures can be precisely planned and simulated by means of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures, created from the tomography data of a patient.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance with the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned as well as with the spatial orientation in the operating site.
After more than 30 years of successful centralization of laboratory analysis, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction of laboratory analyses lead to a renewed re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed close to the patient outside of central or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of the POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small amounts of samples.
While these benefits are often highlighted, they are not accompanied by a clear clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and / or maintenance of analytical equipment by untrained station personnel, lack of calibration or lack of quality control, costs of supplying multiple devices and more expensive reagents, inadequate documentation and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also evident.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes should be:
Haemoglobin or haematocrit, activated whole blood clotting time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionised calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive-diagnostic and minimally-invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
The prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermal stability of contrast agents and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still at the very beginning of development.
It is possible that MR tomography can gain considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Characteristic skeletal changes occur in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely detect the bone mass changes of the spine during long-term haemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spinal columns were completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimension structure can be analyzed directly.
The vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV / TV) and intertrabecular linkage (TBPf) were evaluated quantitatively.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite trabecular bone volume (BV / TV) in the normal range.
BV / TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletal healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve decreasing from HWS to LWS is 5% lower for ROP.
The BV / TV of the 2. LVC is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding pelvic comb biopsy.
The cases with prolonged hemodialysis have higher BV / TV values regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV / TV is not synonymous with physiological networking of Spongiasa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP results in a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be deduced on the 2-D section planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of groin hernia, which did not correspond to what had previously been known due to the course of the disease and the findings of the section by Littre himself.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this sagging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall fracture in a scientific paper on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré-Hernie" in German-speaking countries.
On the basis of a case report, the historical processing of this hernia form takes place.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described by Hans Aspergers in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the disease received increasing attention and was only accepted as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disorder is unexplained.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger syndrome, in which epilepsy and internal abnormalities existed at the same time, is presented.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsy are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections usually manifest in childhood as febrile gastro-enteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
A child is reported in which the Yersinia infection manifested as tumour-like lymphadenitis localised in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was made by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various external yersiniamembrane proteins.
Only after treatment with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings return to normal.
The application of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively studied among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
Questions were investigated as to what conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained under the resuscitation and what consequences arise from these findings.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a reasonable monitoring measure under resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the last 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
A wealth of scientific data was presented at this workshop, highlighting the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old patient, signs of disseminated intravasal coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative period after vaginal hysterectomy and, subsequently, the image of septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis, in the second propionibacterium acnes, could also be detected in this natural blood reserve.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It appears that autologous haemotherapy also carries a not to be underestimated risk of infection and that the retransfusion of own blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a severe infection by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association that developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis following candidasepsis leading to hydronephrosis with incipient postrenal failure.
Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine, and direct flushing with amphotericine B after percutaneous nephrostomy resulted in normalization of excretion function.
With increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, differential diagnosis to nephrolithiasis should also consider the possibility of bezoar formation in order to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy, or only insufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and Non-responders compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the following parameters:
Skin type, minimal erythema dose, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, peripheral blood eosinophils.
On the other hand, non-responders showed a significantly increased atopy score, increased titre of total IgE and specific IgE compared to responders.
In addition, strong germ colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestine with Candida albicans was found comparatively more frequently in the non-responders.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopy syndrome and on the other hand by complicated superinfections.
The latter finding indicates that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antimycotic treatment may be useful for these patients.
The lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupu erythemosus.
On the basis of two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupu erythemosus is shown as well as systemic lup erythematode.
Clinically, subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates are present, which can lead to ulceration and scarring collection.
Histologically, there is lobular panniculitis.
Another diagnostic indication is a positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal boundary and vessels.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology are of particular importance, as the lupus erythematosus profundus can precede the systemic lupu erythemosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-standing chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis older than 45 years.
The patient died under clinical signs of low-output cardiac syndrome as a result of an autoptically and toxicologically confirmed vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy.
The pathogenesis and morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are introduced.
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation formation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new treatments is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies on the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse forms for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific advances in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, in old age, with a single cardiac pumping function, after previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are operated on.
This requires risk stratification, with which the operational risk is divided into "low," "medium" and "high."
It is possible to distinguish pr ‰, intra- and postoperative patient, structural and treatment-related factors.
On the basis of this prediction, the perioperative course is optimized by individually tailored, pr ‰ -, intra- and postoperative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary ‰ r organized management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumours, including Spinaliomas and basaliomas.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, a spinalioma and a lymph node metastasis of malignancy melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complement analysis, which gave assignment to complement group D.
Occasionally, patients with breast, thoracic wall and / or abdominal wall malignancies that have been untreated for years and have been exulcerated in the meantime confront the plastic surgeon with the need for large defectives following tumor resection.
The use of silver-containing activated carbon fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer pads (Allevyn) prevented infection after flank replacement by an omentumplasty as part of the resection of an extensive basalioma.
After secondary meshgraft coverage, fibrosation and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable torso wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The 2000 health care reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health system.
The monopolies of the hospitals for inpatient care and of the contracted doctors for outpatient care are not affected.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be set for outpatient operations that may not be provided in-patient settings.
The obligation to provide quality assurance is clarified and strengthened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for the hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to failure of several organs represents a complex immunological process, which is influenced by local and systemic proinflammatory stimuli, occurs throughout the system and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and antiinflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis includes the upreregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces synthesis of mRNA encoding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibit activation of NF-B and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and system-wide.
If one characterizes this immunoreactivity, one may ultimately also better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are mostly non-specific.
Radiographically, often only brightening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities are recognizable.
Root tip resorptions can be another important finding.
After a short historical analysis, based on the currently valid WHO classification, the current state of knowledge of each individual type is briefly reported.
From this, the current therapy concept is developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
Malignant, locally aggressive, relapsing and non-recurrent tumours.
Generalised Healing Disorder (GHKS) is an often late-recognised mental illness that is characterised by a uniformity of emotional experience in circumstances that are usually the cause of depressive mood, despair, great fear, self-complaint or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person concerned and prevent adverse individual and social long-term effects.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapy regime that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and preserve the life of the patient.
This paper presents the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special consideration of molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of CNS.
Multi-planar jaw reconstruction CT (Dental CT / Denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of mandibula and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in the demarcation of bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the complicated details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows an accurate characterisation of pathologies including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), a causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of the currently available oral IC therapy studies have not been randomised, double-blind or placebo-controlled and thus do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, therefore, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of the IC.
We report about a 39-year-old Turk who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical image of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin changes and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratosis or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and faulty cornification.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin changes and must be distinguished from severe congenital cornification disorders showing the same histological phenomenon of epiderolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic agents are often used in procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in cardioanesthesia.
At the same time, however, there are concerns about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECC should be compared in this case.
Imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
The co-involvement of the Manubriosteranl joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal cintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnosis and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized at the University Eye Hospital Leipzig due to endophthalmitis.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the "endophthalmitis VITRECTOMY study."
In this retrospective work, the functional results of operative treatment should be examined.
Heinrich Heine experienced in his childhood the episode of a pseudologia phantastica.
The condition factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this paper.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the characteristic HLA B27 should be examined.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with a Age of existing severe compulsive symptomatic.
This is not an independent compulsive disease, but a schizophrenia masked by compulsive symptoms.
Under the therapy of the in the 31. Year-old exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms with clozapine are found in the one-year catamnesis neither psychotic symptoms nor significant compulsive symptoms.
While the literature increasingly points to forced symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychosis, here - as far as the author is aware - the rare case of forced symptomatics improved by clozaphrenia is described.
The importance of differential diagnosis of forced phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of the individual case.
Isomorphic irritant effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to unspecific skin irritants.
The initiation of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing with strengths greater than 0.055 J / cm2 is reported.
In addition, the case of a 28-year-old patient who developed new psoriasis foci after varicella infection in the viral fluorescence is described.
Since the person concerned planned to spend several months abroad in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory chemical examinations were carried out.
The presentation was made on the exclusion of oligo-symptomatic rheumatic disease, on the question of genetic risk factors to develop such a disease, and on whether rheumatic factors can occur as a vaccine reaction;
Initial experience and results are reported with 13 one-time reconstructions of large complex defects in the head and neck area with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major island lobes.
Complete lobe losses were in no case.
Better functional and aesthetic results were obtained with the free forearm graft, but the operation times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of pectoralis major flap are mainly poor modelability and limited rotation radius.
It was used in those cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in endothelial cell activation in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
Whereas until now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been regarded primarily as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there has recently been evidence that exogenous factors can, even without cytokine intermediation, transfer endothelial cells to an inflammatory state.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of tissue mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin stimuli.
Treatment-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract / glaucoma surgery, are an indication for local administration of rTPA.
We report on our results.
A case of benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node, first described 5 years ago and not yet documented in German-language literature, is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node swelling occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
Her diagnostic criteria include the construction of sections of palisade-like arranged myofibroblastreen cells (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) to the periphery accentuated haemorrhage zones as well as the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is significant for differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasia.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel inner rails obstruction and kinking could be reduced and a regression of the stowage of the proximal cavity system could be achieved.
Furthermore, in addition to urine flow within the rails, this technique allows for an increased flow between the rails which is considered to be the decisive mechanism of urine passage in lying ureteral splints.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression where the insertion of a single inner splint cannot achieve a sufficient regression of the ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double J ureter splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative that may save some patients from inserting a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy / APLD / laser decompression / chemonucleolysis), the intradiskal application of chymopapain represents the method with the longest clinical duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy, which closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
A prospective study should examine the value of diuresesonography compared to diuresenephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorder.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basaliomas.
The method has been further developed and modified in the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same objective:
Radical tumor removal with protection of the non-infested tissue of the environment.
However, there are significant differences in the technique of tumour excision, the strengthening of histological incisions and the histological assessment of preparations.
A methodological inventory is made and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The "Marjolin Ulcus" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In one case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the right back of the hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedicled radial artery flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with epidural administration of local anaesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is presented, also in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA).
The intrathecal application mode has several advantages over the epidural.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
There is no clinical benefit of thoracic versus lumbar injection in terms of quality of analgesia, serious adverse reactions, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative lung function.
There is evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant impact on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics and / or opioids is the first-choice method for patients at high preoperative risk, while being cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Informationsverbund Dermatologischer Kliniken (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests at the participating centers are centrally recorded in Germany.
For the present study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, perubalsam and thiomersal were most likely to show reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema location, geographical region, occupation, sensitisation) and specific questions were also established.
The percentage of positive reactions for nickel, fragrance mix and perubalsam in men was significantly lower than in women.
Younger patients were more likely to respond to thiomersal, older ones to medical externals.
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, while more occupational allergens have been found in hand eczematicians.
Nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers found higher percentages of positive responses to unrelated allergens compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of the diagnosis and prevention of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all persons infected with M. leprae (in contact), the disease does not occur openly.
The clinical appearance is not so much determined by the direct effects of bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
In this review article current aspects of epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy are considered.
Recently, a variety of studies on the quantitative study of tyndal phenomenon in aqueous humor (KW) by laser tyndallometry have been presented.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison to the tyndal intensity in the KW for uveitids of different locations, it should be investigated by way of example to what extent the Tyndal increase is actually caused by a BKS disturbance.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator and lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-1033E, on the neurological deficit following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to prevent nerve defects with so-called Bridging nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal experimental results do not stand up to a clinical review, because in the animal experiment inferior regeneration performances can occur despite impaired regeneration path.
Morbidity from acute and chronic genital infections and their late effects is the biggest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, one-third developed cervical dysplasia.
A quarter experienced chronic discomfort and late effects of ascendant genital infections over the course of time.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been incorporated into the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but it usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Disorders of menstruation such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhoea have been observed more frequently.
The main complications in pregnancy are premature labour (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth.
Progression of maternal HIV infection from pregnancy has not been observed.
Risks for peripartum transmission to the fetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4 + cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as premature birth, premature labor, amniotic infection, duration of bladder jump and labor, and amniocentesis contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternal HIV-1 transmission rates can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), primary low-contamination C-section delivery (4-6%) and most successfully by primary sectio and concurrent prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells occupy a central position in the initialization of the immune response, because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system, which can activate T lymphocytes via MHC receptors.
Initial clinical studies in patients with treatment-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that sensitized dendritic cells with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Due to the lack of basic data on the presence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function for laryngeal carcinoma, the present study immunohistologically investigated the location of dandritic cell and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinoma of supraglottis and glottis.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with clinical parameters, patients with low dendritic cell counts in carcinoma (< 100 / cells / mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favourable prognostic factor of the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered to be a major factor in the increased incidence of arteriosclerosis in patients with chronic renal impairment.
In the present study, in patients with renal insufficiency, the metabolites of its two breakdown pathways, transulfurization (cystathionine, cysteine formation) and remethylation (methionine formation, methylmalonate and 2-methylcitrate formation) were determined in addition to homocysteine.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis relies on a history of cat scratches and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients in the years 1984-94 cared for in a university polyclinic or a dermatologist's practice was made on the basis of patient records and partly also by follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was 0.05% thereafter.
Out of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 + / - 15.6 years, the mean duration of the disease was 7.9 + / -5.8 years.
Atopia existed in 46.4% of patients and 23.2% had other forms of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic, and fluid-induced urticarias).
Laboratory tests were only positive in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly moderate symptomatic improvement.
During antibiotic treatment (penicillin 1-2 mio IU / d for 2-4 weeks, n = 18 and Tetracycline 2 g / d for 2 weeks, n = 10) was fully remitted in 13 patients and improved in 8.
In 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) spontaneous remission occurred over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment results with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further information on the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old female patient presenting primarily with lumbalgia is reported.
Both laboratory, radiological and histopathological findings primarily supported the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Dorsoventral stabilization was performed due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebral body.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excisions histologically the image of non-specific inflammation was found.
It was only with the biopsy carried out as part of the implant removal that a high-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma was detected histologically.
Chemotherapy followed the CHOP regimen and radiotherapy treatment.
Spinal lymphomas should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive progression.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with mid-face fractures and / or fronto-base fractures in over 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures pass through the roof of ethmoid cells or lamina cribrosa in up to 70% of cases.
Different concepts exist for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and cranial base fractures in middle face fractures.
During the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial Surgery of the Canton Hospital Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and mid-face fractures without skull base involvement, the reposition and care was performed via a subcranial access route.
47 patients could be monitored for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extracranial and transcranial care of fractures of the ethmoidal os with involvement of the base of the skull and the middle face is presented.
However, it carries a high risk of bleeding both intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V. A. Phlebothrombosis should be surgically supplied to a femoral neck fracture.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden decrease in endtidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in PaCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Immediate resuscitation with cardiac pressure massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenalin were initiated.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
Systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed in pulmonary embolism with continued cardiac pressure massage.
After 21 / 4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11 / 2 hours after onset of lysis, moderately stable haemodynamics were achieved with continuous, highest dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
Massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy.
On 28. The day after resuscitation, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis "pulmonary embolism" was made by clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Because of the emergency situation with continuous resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were waived.
In anaesthesia with the new inhalation anaesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total intake is metabolised.
The extent of the resulting peak serum levels of inorganic fluoride determines, in particular, the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anaesthetic administered and the solubility of the anaesthetic gas expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficient.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, there was no evidence of increased renal hazard potential for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane either in animal experiments, routine clinical use or during protracted anaesthesia, or in renal insufficiency patients.
The recent low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enfluran and, above all, methoxyflurine - is considered to be an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of Sevoflurans.
The threshold for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol / l, which has so far been used in the literature, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anaesthesia gases sevofluran, but also enflurana and isofluranic.
Fluoride levels, such as those found following anaesthesia with sevoflurane, are therefore considered clinically safe.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence of direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of macroscopic preparation method is fundamental.
The best results are obtained by basisparallele lamination of the heart ventricles after fixation and transverse lamellation of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if postmortem coronary angiography cannot precede.
In this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference and transmural extension of infarcts, their age and sequelae can be better recorded and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than in the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood stream.
The degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque haemorrhages, parietal and occluding thrombosis can be assessed in the coronary arteries as well as therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in the case of acute cardiac death and only briefly survived territorial ischemia.
By systematically collecting transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be recorded in correlation with coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
However, recent prospective randomised studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after R0 resection does not provide an additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both squamous and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, oesophagogastral junction and stomach are not conclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumours, no convincing prognostic gain from preoperative radiatio, chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy / chemotherapy has been demonstrated in several phase III studies compared to single resection.
However, a survival benefit with this multimodal approach is only expected in response to pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radiotherapy / chemotherapy improves response rates, at least for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be conducted in prospective studies in strictly selected patients in specialised centres with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual in childhood, is usually associated only with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or "hysterical" symptoms can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and youth experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after traumatic experience.
Non-assimilable memories of trauma have a retraumatizing effect and must be resisted by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behavior or social "acting."
On this psychodynamic background we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, in the imagination resource-oriented, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created.
The actual trauma work consists in a dosed, stable confronting, but as little as possible retraumatizing approach to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and behind-yourself.
The final phase is again about the resource-oriented turn to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record developments at a national school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years in terms of diagnoses and the proportion of multiple disabled people.
Chronic benign intracranial hypertension can have multiple causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained appearance in obese young women ("Pseudotumor cerebri"), a venous discharge obstruction is possible as a cause.
The extent to which visual acuity remains stable in diabetic retinopathy in the long-term course after vitrectomy was investigated, and which causes and risk factors can be identified for deterioration of visual acidity.
HIV is easy to inactivate by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entrance gate.
After inoculation, HIV multiplication may have started after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can detect the onset of HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, while under therapy, the antibody response is weakened;
With zero acid tests, the detection succeeds from about the eleventh day.
In almost 100 years of development, countless endogenous, foreign and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadrupled tendon graft of the Pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus / M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon transplant have the greatest clinical significance.
With some limitations, the use of corpse transplants is also justified.
The individual grafts have specific differences in biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of these grafts could not be verified.
Graft selection must take into account the different anatomical and functional requirements of anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
In the treatment of complex ligament injuries and revision cases, careful, preoperative planning with, if necessary, modified graft selection is required.
The rare course of formation of myoepithelial carcinoma in pleomorphic adenoma of small salivary glands of oral mucosa is presented.
In the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrence tumor developed 2 times in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological treatment showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnosis, therapy and histological characteristics considering the literature are discussed.
Coronary lime is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance varies depending on whether the lime screening is performed in patients with already known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant partial aspect of coronary heart disease.
In this paper, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects with regard to ergometry are presented, as well as indications for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice are given.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immunothrombocytopenic pura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and Prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
On the other hand, among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM, we have not observed any case of ITP.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immunothrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, further diseases should be excluded from the form of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
Securing the airways after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
Care should therefore be taken to ensure a safe re-intubation in case of need.
Two patients have been reported with significant intubation difficulties due to papillary thyroid cancer recurrence or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma, resulting in high risk factors for intubing and, where appropriate, Had reintubation in general anesthesia.
A fiberoptically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and stage classification of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucous tumor propagation pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for stage management and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive investigations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of preepiglottic space, paraglottic room, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity is less than initially expected with both methods, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two sectional imaging methods is important from a clinical point of view, as it makes it possible to exclude neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucous tumours, both CT and MRI provide valuable evidence of possible etiology, the extent of sub-mucous growth, and the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters / defibrillators (ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
Patients with end-stage renal disease have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only small cases of myocardial revascularization by PTCA in patients on chronic dialysis, suggesting a high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We examined the restenosis rate in 23 patients with end-stage renal disease (17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52,5 + / - 18,3 years).
After primary successful PTCA, all patients underwent recoronary angiography within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic control, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginal discomfort.
In laboratory chemistry, patients had hypertriglyceridaemia (265 + / - 160 mg / dl) and hypercholesterolaemia (258 + / -53 mg / dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 + /-14 mg / dsl), with a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 + / ‑ 114 mg / ddl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient who experienced complete pelvic instability within one year due to increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings is described.
As a triggering event, minor trauma for the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed.
Due to the x-ray morphology of multiple pseudoarthrosis, differential diagnosis initially focused on the suspicion of malignant events.
For hip pain in childhood, a wide range of different diseases are considered as causative.
Emphasis is placed on non-traumatic causes in differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand, and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
By exemplary examples, some common but also rarer disease patterns are demonstrated.
Iatrogenic demolition of Trochanter major in prosthetic care of femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthetic implantation from the so-called "posterior approach" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated and here used for comparison traumatic trochanter blasting, even with significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care remains controversial.
The present paper presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in detail using data from quality assurance.
The zuf-8 examines relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, the further use behavior of the patients and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This shows that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
In the further utilization behavior dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is clear in part for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are relatively large, but in absolute terms these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in man's aging process resemble changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels decrease on average with age, correlations between middle and older age complaints and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, inter alia, to methodological limitations in existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference levels for older men and a variety of influences (health status and behaviour) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with five-day dyspnoea underwent ultrasonography prior to planned lysis therapy following nuclear medicine evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
There was a right atrial, floaty thrombus.
In the presence of acute vital hazard, ultra-high-dose short-term streptokinase analysis (UHSK) was initiated with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely dissolved and the thrombosis of the leg had largely dissolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
50% of patients were found to have a single fracture and the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
The hospitalization duration was on average 17 days and the use of crutches on average 21 weeks, which speaks for a relatively fast healing process.
In the majority (85%), treatment was without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) open fracture patients and only 2 (0.4%) closed fracture patients, which is within normal standards.
On the basis of our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of femoral diaphyse with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared with other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnosis in head and neck tumors is still controversial.
In the present retrospective study, based on the course of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract, the factors influencing the frequency and location of distant metastasis were investigated.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The remote metastasis rate was positively correlated with the initial tumor stage (p < 0.00001) as well as with the manifestation of a local and / or regional recurrence (P < 0000001) or second tumor outside the ENT area (p > 0.0005).
The parameters'primary tumor localization 'and'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, did not have an independent predictive value, but reflected essentially different frequencies of tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, remote metastasis searches in T1-3 N0 tumours may be limited to a chest X-ray.
Further diagnosis, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy and / or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated in locoregionally advanced tumours, in relapses and in secondary tumours outside the ENT area.
However, in individual cases, one should always ask the question of the therapeutic consequences.
This paper presents a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the 19th century. Century given to our time.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who worked with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytical principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of a first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and of the first psychoanalytical hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in Germany in 1927.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions of professional societies.
He is a credible career political figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine."
Nevertheless, Simmel's emphasis should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who had to forcibly leave Germany because of their Jewish descent, are no longer properly thought of.
Basically, 4 post-traumatic states of proximal femur can be affected by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocation and subluxation, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computertomographic / sonographic analysis of the leg geometry plays a central role here.
With the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a completely individual problem.
The aim of the study was to provide a meta-analytical review of all available randomised, controlled studies in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other anti-emetics for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase (PONV).
Scleritis and epicleritis can occur in the context of numerous system diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and visual-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term through systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs in more than 80% of cases on the side of compression, a causal relationship can be assumed.
Since this disturbance also reduces the foramen intervertebral, the space shortage in the herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for the malignant changes in the pancreatic head area, is very extensive and burdened with high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the organ-saving duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection was also a sufficiently radical procedure in benign tumours of the pancreas head.
This operation could be performed in the patients in a blood-saving manner and almost without complications.
At a median follow-up time of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, and in one patient who underwent gastrinoma surgery, increased gastric values were observed late postoperatively.
Compared with preoperative function testing, the endocrine and exocrine function were only slightly affected by the operation.
If strictly indicated, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can thus be treated adequately, sufficiently radical, with little complications and without permanent restriction of exo- and endocrine functions by means of a duodenum-preserving pancreatic Fresection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and / or prognostic bradycardial cardiac arrhythmias.
Approximately one in six patients dies in the following period after pacemaker implantation of a sudden cardiac death, which is largely attributable to the progression of the pre-existing cardiac underlying disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrostimulation of the heart may involve the risk of triggering and / or aggraviating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.
Especially in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transitory myocardischemia, can trigger stimulation-induced secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythms.
Given that such pacemaker-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding and awareness of the pathomechanisms involved should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but, above all, safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with a curative purpose, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from a chirurgical intervention and are fed alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), ultrasonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal cintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, e.g. after thoracic wall infiltration, and in patients with a contrast agent allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition or alternatively to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F] 2-FLouro-2-Desoxy-D-Glucose (FDG-PET) for the assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, in-111-octreotide / somatostatin scans for staging / diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical value is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly used for staging lung tumours.
Methods that are currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor resoptor, could play an important role in the staging of bronchus carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdomen, the retroperitoneum and the small pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs can occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, particular importance is attached to the prevention of such side effects in tumor therapy.
Impairment of erection or dysfunction of ejaculation may occur after operative, radiotherapy or drug therapy of various tumors.
Through in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now preventable in a high percentage.
If damage to the corresponding nerve tracts cannot be avoided due to the necessary radicality of the surgical procedure in order to cure the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunction is a clear limitation of the quality of life for these patients in sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated in almost all cases through a number of treatment modalities.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the cervical vessels in different cannulation locations.
A truck driver is reported to have developed atypical heparinduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under drug thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin after crushing trauma to both legs;
In addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with positive evidence of antibodies against Heparin:
At our first patient contact on 6. Day after the accident, deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and threatening compartment syndrome was also surgically cleaved on the lower left leg.
After the exclusion of possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin (Heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction that could be immediately broken by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, otherwise described as characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin that occurs on the cell surface of the thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the different forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Types I and II correspond to the previous HIT 1 and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte decay and type IV is the anti-body reaction with general allergic symptoms.
The basal cell adenocarcinoma is 1991 as an entity in the 2. Edition of the "histological typification of salivary gland tumors" of the World Health Organization (WHO) has been included.
The first description goes to Ellis u. Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
The gl. parotis is located in 90% of the cases of this tumor.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here relates to a middle-aged woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of an operative tumor extirpation with a sufficient safety margin and histologically controlled tumor freedom of all resection margins.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma is known to have a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastatic rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
A modified animal experimental model of renal xenotransplantation was developed in the present paper, within which the course of hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs on wistarrats as recipient animals, with end-to-end vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or V. cava and ureteral drainage by splinting were used for diuretic monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation on renal xenografts by using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1).
A total of 24 xenotransplants were performed and randomised to 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) and 50 mg / kg sCR1 as 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in increasing graft survival time (from 10.5 + / - 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity in the sCR1 group was observed, which is due to a modulatory effect of the sCR 1.
Histologically, platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates were found on a massive scale in the control group as early as 10 min after the onset of reperfusion.
The renal grafts treated with sCR1, on the other hand, showed significantly reduced intravasal thrombosis and less interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and interstitium in the treatment group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic procedures have been carried out in our house on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and hernia with the robotic arm for optical guidance controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of vision is directly determined by commands of the operator.
In all the interventions, the control of the robot arm was precise, the speech recognition was accurate and without any technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by an surgeon alone as "solo surgery."
In another 20 interventions, only one assistant was used in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications by DSA in renal and pancreatic transplants requires invasive intervention in mostly diabetic damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents may show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of a coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in collaboration with the accident surgical clinic of the Klinikum Minden.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the therapy result and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both in the local rehabilitation of the infection, as well as in the functional result regarding.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment of atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials by means of modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favour interruption of the wave fronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether the mechanisms of cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation are different from those in acute AF.
Neurological complications in clavicular fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more commonly secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with constriction of the kostoclavicular space.
Casuistically, late lesion of the brachial plexus due to a clavicular fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is observed.
Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The object of our investigations was the determination of the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patient's property of the Diabetes Ambulance of the Children's Hospital of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of absorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement plastic is reported, resulting in a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with detection of foreign body giant cells.
Prim ‰ re plasmocytomas of the kidney represent a large rarite ‰ t.
To date, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64 ‰ -year-old patient is presented in which an operated renal tumor was histologically shown to be plasmacytoma.
On the basis of this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only in renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement by the plasmacytoma is unclear.
Within the framework of a multicentre, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radial fractures of the adult were treated according to the fracture type and / or a suitable therapy procedure.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
So far, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known, which follow the pattern of the Blashko lines.
In 1992 Moulin et al described.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired stripe-shaped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he highlighted as a new entity.
We report another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are stripe-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without inflammatory preliminary stage and without subsequent sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of blashko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and, in order to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise programme, which can also be carried out safely as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint conservation are trained by practicing simple movements and basic knowledge of anatomy, arthrosis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors is taught.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was demonstrated in a prospective randomized examination.
For the successful and permanent replacement of knee joints, the correct alignment and size of the implants is of outstanding importance.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are presented.
As part of the Erlanger Glaucoma Study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has been shown to be suitable for the separation of secured diseased patients from secured controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital primary care of 274 children was either acutely injured (58%) or sick (42%) by 14 years of age. According to the emergency medical documentation, the patient is examined with regard to the temporal occurrence of the interventions, the observance of the auxiliary period, the age and gender distribution, the severity, the causes of trauma and injury patterns, the type of acute pediatric disease, the prehospital emergency diagnosis and therapy, the means of transport and the target clinic.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the Orthopedic University Hospital Mainz has been examining in which diseases low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be used sensibly.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with increasing age, but also in pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations for diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow area were analyzed in the context of the present study in volunteers.
Therapy control is currently not possible in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and condition after cardioversion due to atrial flaring.
Therefore, patients without a real tendency to relapse are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic regimen and thus to the risk of proarrythmic side effects.
The imperative requirement of P wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must be performed, the filtering of the P-wave must be carried out bidirectional or with a FIR filter.
Standardisation of the method is highly desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P wave duration from patients without this rhythm disorder.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P wave is significantly different.
In summary, P wave signal averaging after optimization of the method allows identification of patients with high recurrence probability of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
Chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
Knowledge of pain genesis is a prerequisite for efficient pain therapy.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the noziceptive afferences are routed through an intact nervous system.
Neuropathic pain, by contrast, underlies injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitivity mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to a chronization of such pain.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented by means of treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, coanalgestics and opioid analgetics have a firm place, especially in chronic pain.
The regulation of these substances must respect defined standards of pain therapy.
Blockages with local anesthetics as monotherapy of chronic pain are now obsolete.
In post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations may make sense as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages have a special significance in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic entertained pain (SMP).
The significance of radiation of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in lymphnode-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or methodically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3 / 4 carcinoma, the additional irradiation of the paraortic lymphatic pathways does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumour-specific survival compared to exposure to the pelvic lymph nodes alone and is obsolete.
Data on long-term adverse reactions are only available from studies with outdated irradiation techniques.
Radiotherapy of the lymphatic pathways in lymphnode-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be used in studies (e.g. B. Aro 95-3).
Due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, however, only pathomorphological examination permits a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as their special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumohorax caused by acute puncture of the pleura can usually be definitely supplied by a thin-caliber drainage.
On the other hand, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated in a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in respiratory patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
Haematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be rapidly treated with Bülau drainage due to the risk of severe blood loss and, if necessary, treated surgically.
A spontaneous hematothorax also requires drainage and internal clarification.
The doctor in an intensive care unit must master the diagnosis and therapy of pneumo- and hematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive-care patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology and radiology.
Similarly, the lethality, the overall severity of injury, the likelihood of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic concurrent injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. the pelvic injury with accompanying peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvis injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the care of organ lesions is at the forefront of interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabulum fractures pose a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Operative therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long - term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term result deteriorates.
Primary accident-related cartilage damage appears to have a significant effect on the long-term outcome after acetabulum fractures.
Isolated calcifying atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old patient, such as aortenisthmus stenosis.
Remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of calcification.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax gave differential diagnostic indications of calcifying aortic tumor, secondary calcified wall dissection, or expired aortitis.
Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalysis of external segments and is exposed to regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since cholesterol and phospholipids are absorbed via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
With reference to the changes in educational and social structures, medical habilitation as an academic qualification has recently been called into question.
In the discourse on the application and development of reproductive techniques, the experience aspects of those affected take a back seat.
Assistance outside medical treatment is only requested by many at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is among the most common metastatic localizations in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial cancers.
The decision on systemic therapy procedures depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
Hormone therapy is the first choice for receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or detection of liver metastases.
In the case of small cell bronchial carcinoma, chemotherapy should in principle be performed.
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma are accessible to radioiodine therapy.
In metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is rather restrained and is mainly limited to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging bone metastasis response to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for determining bone breakdown products in urine could prove valuable.
Differential diagnosis and treatment of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve strain pain should be investigated.
The risk of contracting HIV professionally is often perceived subjectively as high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, there are e.g. B. a clear recommendation on hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In the case of injuries with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-positionally.
There is no medicated post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon in detection of HCV RNA appears to have a high success rate.
In preparations of a videothoracoscopic lung biopsy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong-positive reactions both in the muscularly differentiated tissues of angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation of up to 5 cm in diameter in the left frontal brain.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidney, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion on euthanasia as well as the developments in Australia and Oregon point to an increasing tendency to give preference to medical assistance for suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 1994 on the suicide allowance of a psychiatrist provides an opportunity to examine this issue from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitrogen oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
Histochemically and immunohistochemically, this study investigated the location and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
A differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, stroma and vessels was demonstrated both by the NADPH diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemically.
In the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there appears to be a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although due to the small number of preparations, no quantitative evaluation has yet been made.
In the endothelial region, differentiated expression of NOS as a function of the vascular section was also demonstrated by the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the glandular epithelium region with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases indicates a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional circulation and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Because of heterogeneous patient groups and diverse ileus causes, the surgical indication and the surgical procedure choice in the small intestine ileus is difficult to standardize.
A uniform procedure for the intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of a intestinal splint) and the abdominal occlusion (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small bowel implantation continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble's surgery largely replaced by Child-Phillips's plicature and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no confirmed indications or contraindications for plicatures, long probes and other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socio-economic importance of the small intestine ileus, changing this remains an important task for the future.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results obtained by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can make it possible to increase their social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, while at the same time preventing misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for providing reliable advice to the couples concerned.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle power of depressive persons have often been described in the clinical literature, but so far hardly empirically investigated.
We measured various gait and force parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework based essentially on classical clinical observations of depression.
Twenty hospitalized depressive subjects were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which detect stride length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace and 3-min walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The course of examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were demonstrated, especially in knee and elbow extension and in all gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the context of this pilot study are suitable for the reliable and less stressful investigation of relationships between depression and motor function and can thus be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxed lens.
This can lead to an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or a chronic glaucom exists.
YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We report the results after cataract surgery in subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the effect of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x + / - s):
PS patients 7.1 + / - 3.2 pmol / l, N 1.6 + / -1.6 pmoL / l).
VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences from the normal values except for point deviations (x + / - s):
PS patients 10.7 + / - 7.1 pmol / l, N 12.0 + / -5.3 pmoL / l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years of progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex and memory phenomena in lymphocytes.
The -L-fucosi- dase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly decreased (< 3% of normal).
So far, the mutation G401X has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventricular atrial shunt systems.
We report about a 4.6-year-old girl who came to the stationary intake with the signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase negative staphylococci and elevated liquor protein were detected in cerebrospinal fluid.
The thrombus had to be cardiosurgically removed.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine.
With this routine test, at the post-mortem examination of three were clearly as a result of freezing or Hypothermia of deceased persons obtained strong positive results for ketones without at the same time increasing glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography revealed excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg / L in all three urine samples.
A highly positive Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 with normal glucose findings in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid for the detection of death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study in 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can make statements about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide indications for the therapeutic procedure.
Infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, papules and papulovesicles appeared eruptively symmetrically at the extremities.
Viral serology indicated fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, while serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
Temporomandibular joint cluxations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the chewing muscles.
The previous classifications are primarily based on the anatomical position relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation and discus dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
In a number of neurological diseases, temporomandibular joint cluxations have been described as a complication.
On the basis of the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint clusions as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the concept of neurogenic maxillofacial joint clustering.
Fire marks can lead to considerable psychosocial stress.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, quality of life and body experience of patients with refractory paints and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
As part of the therapy with the flash-lamp-pulsed dye laser, a test psychological examination was carried out on 70 patients with refractory paints in the areas of disease management, quality of life and body experience.
Clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the fire mal in the course of therapy.
Patients with Feuermalen had similar levels of stress in terms of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the firemark.
In terms of helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients with firemarks were significantly less stressed.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
Body experience is affected differently by disease management.
Since the lightening in the course of laser therapy is significantly correlated with reduced psychosocial stress, flashlight pulsed dye laser therapy can also be considered effective with respect to psychosocial factors in firepainting.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is a distinct disease, as biological behavior, prognosis, and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and stage layout of the PGIL.
The gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological manifestations and a wide spectrum in imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic possibilities.
A 43-year-old man had a nevus sebaceus in the right temple area since birth.
At the histopathological examination, 2 lesion-associated adnexneoplasia showed:
A syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the history (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q-jags, new occlusion of the left leg block) and increased values of the "classic cardiac enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementia.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia in a patient over 80 years of age within a few months.
At present, not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the course of treatment of the disease allows differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with concomitant hypothyroidism and secondary dementia caused by hypothyreosis.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalised atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and renal artery stenosis, a near-terminal anurysm of the subclavian left artery was successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable Jostent © -Peripheral Stent graft.
The course observation over one year showed a very good long-term result with free perfused stentlumen and completely switched off aneurysm.
In a control computed tomography there was a completely thrombosed aneurysm bag.
There was no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent in intravascular ultrasound.
The pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a separate entity by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary in 1930.
Nevertheless, the first half of the 19th century saw the. Century illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost necessarily suggest a pyoderma gangraenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains casuistics of various forms of syphilitic affects of the skin as well as individual images of gangrenous ulcers, which occurred completely unexpectedly under the then common mercury therapy.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this burgeoning mercury therapy, as they spontaneously healed after discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of the pyoderma gangraenosum can be found more than 100 years before the first designation.
However, the etiology of this disease is still not sufficiently clear to this day.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangraenosum remained in several publications until well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study addresses the question of whether recovery of cognitive functions after TIVA with remifentanil / propofol (P / R) occurs faster than after balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane / fentanyl (S / F).
Uniform oestradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicle phase.
In oral oestrogen replacement therapy, oestradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly fluctuating levels of active substances with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high oral oestrogen doses are necessary because there is a pronounced oestrogenic metabolism during liver passage.
What significance does the ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn have in the diagnosis and therapy planning of a meconium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small intestine matresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation who has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
Measuring the physical resilience of patients with cystic fibrosis and detecting stress-related changes in oxygen saturation were objectives of the present study.
Reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions and Tumors of the urinary bladder was to better meet the biology of the different lesions as well as to perform a sharper separation between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The significance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically considered.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary Urothelial Neoplasia low malignant potentials, as well as papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia and the carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
The present study attempts to establish relationships between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
One then speaks of a sympathetic maintained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflexdystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndrome and the acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant relationship between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back problems.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdomen spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindication to non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients with compensated renal failure (not yet undergoing dialysis) and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multiline) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood are corrosion, burn, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign body, eyeball bruise, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants / year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Age (< 5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care are known as risk factors for eye injury in childhood.
The prognosis regarding visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced not only by rapid and adequate therapy but also by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or adhesion of the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis).
Deficits and dysbalances of the vertebral column stabilizing musculature are considered as important somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back problems.
The aim of prevention and rehabilitation must therefore be to maintain and restore the full performance of the muscles stabilising the spine, along with the training of coordination skills and the learning of vertebral column-appropriate behaviour.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including neurophysiological procedures, physical-balneological measures and supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important procedure for the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training teaching and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In their phase structure, different therapy goals are presented, but especially the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation course.
Indication and supervision of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation with physiotherapists and treating physicians.
Surgery on vertebral gliding results from pain, progressive gliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, from radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and spondyloptosis may result in plastic deformation of the osseous spondylidesis mass with further progression of gliding.
With the external fixator as a reposition instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, the reposition of heavy sliding processes and the restoration of a normal spinal and hull form with a reasonable neurological risk is also possible today.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, the anatomical reposition of the gliding vertebra is in any case the goal.
Depending on the degree of gliding, reposition and stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
Dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for Grade 1 dislocations.
At grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this article, is to investigate the effects of a gerontopsychiatric center (GZ:
To subject a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and elderly counseling) for the first time to an empirical examination of the transformation process from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extra-mural" (day-clinic and clinical-outpatient, i. w. home-supported) regional care structures, as demanded by the Federal Government's expert commission.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional care sub-structures of gerontopsychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (sub-system B) and old people's help (Subsystem C) are analyzed by comparing the supply region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ.
With regard to subsystem A, the study shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selecting its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the system of assistance for the elderly (subsystem C) may be reflected in the fact that in the Gütersloh care region the home referral rate after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leucocytosis) and massive movement restriction in the right shoulder joint.
Sonographically and computertomographically, in addition to edema of skin and fat tissue, extensive fluid accumulations around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitia and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint have been detected.
With systemic corticoid therapy, the skin lesions quickly healed, and subsequently also the mobility in the shoulder joint was restored.
In the case described, the involvement of articular structures in eosinophilic cellulitis has been demonstrated for the first time with modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin / cyclophosphamide enables breast-preserving treatment in larger tumours that are primarily unsuitable for breast-sustaining treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be followed with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The good reproducibility and availability speaks for mammography.
Tumours that cannot be demarcated by mammography can usually be represented by sonography.
In MRI, tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mamma parenchyma.
The determination of the extent of tumor residuals after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially non-invasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even when the invasive tumor regresses and typically show intraductal, non-invasive tumor residuals.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents itself clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for moving a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
Using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, this report discusses the treatment of the pronounced GBS in the intensive care unit.
In morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be capable of immediately applying and thus preventing an emerging dissection.
Neurosurgical therapy methods of Parkinson's disease (PK) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, based on advances in basic research.
Thus, for the first time, a two-track functional model clarifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets of neurosurgical procedures.
Its pathological disinhibition is caused by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - In the clinic both lesional and restorative and stimulative procedures are currently used.
The pallidotomy and thalamotomy techniques used earlier have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological targeting.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigor, hypokinesia and medically induced dyskinesia, the latter method has proven to be effective in treating the tremor.
Only in the case of fetal cell transplantation is there documented re-emergence of dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine secretion;
However, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
The high-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamus kernels to treat the tremor;
Xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells are part of the animal experimental approach.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic Al-koholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol sequelae disease in addition to more common diseases such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal cramp, Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), relapsing focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic side-stressed steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abusus was admitted after several secondary generalised focal seizures of the right side of the body under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed increased levels of Gamma-GT and MCV.
There was microangiopathy and brain atrophy in CCT and cerebral MRI.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-fold anticonvulsive therapy, seizures and worsening of the general condition have continued to be observed.
Several EEG investigations revealed periodic steep left parietookzipital stressed waves.
Three months after the onset of the symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basaliomas in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell naevus syndrome (BCNS), a xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (so far 86 cases in world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of the BCNS or the consequence of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodular basalioma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the history nor the clinical examination indicated any genetic disposition to basalioma formation.
In 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was conducted using pelvic crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to mitigate the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
On the basis of the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61 + megacaryocytes, including their vorl ‰ bank cells, could be calculated with the fiber density.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megacaryopoiesis and fibroblasts in view of the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis genesis.
This was observed in about 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68 + macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f + nucleated erythropoietic vorl ‰ ufer cells, which can be related to the inclusion of this cell line in the iron metabolism, H ‰ moglobin synthesis and the degradation of the emitted normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl-expressing) pseudo-gauche cells were detected in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibration could be calculated with clinical parameters such as H ‰ moglobin levels, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood and the spleen size.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
Corresponding h ‰ matological data had to be assigned to this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies in 173 patients receiving IFN, Hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) monotherapy showed fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main ‰ cial cell lines during treatment are best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences between the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the associated time differences.
In patients with complete h ‰ matological remission after IFN administration, erythropoiesis regeneration was observed along with an increase in the number of CD68 + macrophages including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups showed a transition from both a (non-fibrous) granulocyte ‰ and megakaryocyte ‰ ren subtype to a myelofibrotic group in approximately 40% of the patients during ongoing investigations.
This Ph ‰ nomen was in contrast to a numerous ‰ ﬂigen reduction of the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients treated with HU in 17 F ‰ llen (36%).
Together, the remarkable heterogeneity ‰ t of bone marrow findings in CML requires a careful morphological evaluation of biopsies with appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 consecutive patients admitted to a medical-geriatric unit should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination as well as the values in the mini-mental-state examination (2), 51 patients were considered unexaminable.
The remaining 74 patients were clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia may have been detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.
In 41 patients mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, in more than half of them the disorder was relevant for the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used have proved reliable and can therefore be recommended for further use.
But remains open, as after this result at every 5th to 6th Patients required therapy of mental disorder can be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnosis of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
The magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are study dependence, the lack of standardisation so far and the still relatively high costs.
For this reason, the "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatic Center Berlin," which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal tradiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which technical details are carried out in addition to the clinical background and radiation exposure and cost effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Hiob syndrome, Buckley syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The disease is characterized by recurrent urticarial rash, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
The diagnostic trend is strongly increased serum IgE concentrations in the absence of evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been shown to be excellently tolerated and effective.
More than one year after the single therapy, the symptoms are continuously improved.
The current state of knowledge and available therapy options in Hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In Hyper IgE syndrome, an IVIG therapy trial should be a first-choice option.
The present paper presents the results after laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplicatio in 70 patients based on life quality data 3 years after surgery.
The individual subdimensions of the GLQI record corresponding scores.
More than 98% of all patients rated the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new anti-reflux operation if necessary.
Persistent side effects of surgery, but not affecting quality of life, were reported in 4 patients.
No patient needed re-medication anti-reflux therapy.
Laparoscopic refludoplicatio was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of the surgical therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplicatio can be documented not only by objective findings, but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by the measurement of quality of life data and can be proven in the longer term.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are groundbreaking, as is the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, the resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appear superior to selective tumor removal.
In malignant insulin, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under § 216 StGB;
Even from a medical point of view, it is ethically unjustifiable.
This is not changed by the various tendencies to make the "killing on demand" in Germany, as in the Netherlands, punishable under certain conditions.
Nutrient proportions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished from immunologically active cells of the intestinal-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in the seriously ill.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are particularly important as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are fermented bacterially in the lower intestinal sections to mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These exert, among other things, a trophic effect on the mucosa of the colon by improving blood flow.
Among the non-food substances, it is mainly the hormones gastrin and enteroglukagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the maintenance of eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological condition.
The use of a diary as a measuring instrument made it possible to identify individual assessments of situational factors influencing care on the one hand and stress-promoting factors in the care process on the other.
The results show large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors as well as their effects on physical and psychological condition.
Continuation fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as differential diagnosis in acute and chronic pain around the ankle joints.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term outcome.
Computed tomography (CT) is essential for the definitive diagnosis and indication of the therapy to be used.
Dislocated fractures lead conservatively treated, as far as presented in the literature and according to own experience, to pain and restriction of movement and thus in the long term to arthrotic remodeling of the subtalar joint.
In the indication for an operative procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to allow a consequential healing.
Debris fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course can not be estimated due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unclear, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, a proliferation of dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines is also detectable in undamaged skin and increased P-selectin in serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammation system in the urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in adult indolent mastocytosis, but not in childhood forms.
In contrast to the general assumption, acute urticaria is rarely based on IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies to foods (73%) and less frequently chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-lasting remissions in meiden (diet) or Elimination of triggers.
On the other hand, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria should mainly be considered secondary and not disease-inducing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder belt, usually associated with vitally threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to represent the variability of possible injuries along with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which can usually only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are represented in the temporal sequence of the polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of supply are pointed out.
Reports from previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small group of patients show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, whereby cross-references to the management are made together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly vitally threatened patients.
A retrospective study analyzed the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Out of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course is known for 2 months to 35.2 years (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (< = 20%) was found in higher T-stages, with increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In the statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (< = 20% / > 20%), synchronous remote metastasis (M0 / PM1, cm1) and the radicality of the procedure (R0 / R1, 2) were found to be prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a danger to adults as the age peak shifts.
With the MMR combination vaccination an effective method for the prevention of this disease and its sequelae is available.
The 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make rubella embryopathy a disease of the past.
The objective of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Age (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied ageing in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and tolerability.
By regional comparison, personality differences were found in neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, and subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region resulted in openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement as well as in the doctor's part.
More than 80% of intraabdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and most of them occur after abdominal surgery.
They are classified as intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitonealspace abscesses for anatomy.
The sonographically or CT-controlled percutaneous abscess drainage is today a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approx. 80%.
Liver abscesses are predominantly interventional, pancreatic, spleen and crohn abscesse are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amoebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
Since the mid to late 1980s, different research groups have been trying to improve the prediction of premature birth by immunological diagnosis - in particular by cytokine detection.
However, it turns out to be a disadvantage that this prenatal diagnosis can only convince from the amniocentesis of amniotic fluid, but not from the serum of the pregnant women.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placenta perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokindiagnostics is the high variation width of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
It is possible that PCR-guided cytokine detection from the cervix of pregnant women is a viable way forward.
The stress of the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured while sitting than when standing.
There is therefore little objection to allowing patients in whom the spine has been mono-or bisegmentally stabilized to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
Due to the additional ventral stabilization with bone chips, the strain on the bisegmental implants was often significantly changed.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher after ventral stabilization than before.
A corset or bodice did not reduce the implant load.
It is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono-segmental or bisegmental stabilisation of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningioma was added to the revised WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is supposed to denote meningeomas with an increased relapse tendency compared to usual meningeomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for the anaplastic meningeoma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We searched for further prognostically relevant parameters:
Using the morphometrically determined core area Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningeomes of all 3 degrees (N = 160), which were found to be valid in comparison with the "relapse" free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a little structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleols.
Nuclear pleomorphy, necrosis and mitosis figures were optional.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, showed in 50% of the cases a distal unit loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p-).
Histochemically, we have shown that in meningiomas, the non-tissue form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is 1p, can be used as a progression and relapse-associated marker enzyme (loss of enzyme activity in 30 / 39 intermediate and 8 / 8 anaplastic meningeomas).
Instead of the term "atypical," which is ambiguous in clinical everyday life and can give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose the term intermediate-type meningeomas for this group of relatively recurrent tumours, which lies between the usual and the anaplastic meningiomas.
The joint continuation fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures due to the special anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment is for highly dislocated or luxated fractures.
Preauricular, sub- and perimanedibular, retromandibular and oral approaches are established as operative approaches.
For the fixation of the fragments, only functionally stable methods, such as the mini plate or tensile screw, should be used.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with VA focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report the manifestation of malignant porocarcinoma, multiple precancerous keratosis and basalioma, and palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing CSF fowleri (Fowler's);
Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as an adjunct finding.
Background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in Black Africa, dermatology is completely insufficiently represented in the basic health services established there.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system on the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single hospital of the priority care.
Due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities, the PhotoDermVL enables a large selection of individually selectable treatment parameters.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasia, naevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast carcinoma metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in the woman.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, identify risk factors with respect to the occurrence and evaluate the benefits of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute relapse.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often hardly manageable.
In addition, many treatment-induced adverse reactions occur during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which were also difficult to control by administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide / azathioprine.
Both channels were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to immunosuppression.
In both cases, the initially high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) were eliminated to a minimum of maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained free of the disease with minimal prednisolone immunosuppressive maintenance during the 1-year follow-up period.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very patchy in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with a typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyria and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under wood light has been applied by the addition of fluorescence markers in the application control of Topika.
Endocardial mapping is possible with induction of hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms in the context of programmed ventricle stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of circular excitation by stimulation maneuvers ("entrainment mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In the clinical occurrence and induction of only singular chamber tachycardia, in about 60-70% of cases, the high-frequency current catheter ablation enables acutersuccess with termination and suppression of inducability.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a recurrence must be expected.
In continuous ("incessant") chamber tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachy cardia after implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
At present, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapy procedure for drug treatment and implantation of cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1. 1. 1985 to 31. 12. In 1995, following conventional surgery and R0 resection of the tumor, the effect of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rates was retrospectively investigated in 386 patients with rectum carcinoma in UICC stage I-III.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the numbers of affected lymph nodes, and associated with this a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (P = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
In the total disease and multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no effect on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of a more accurate tumor stacking.
This indicates the influence of other factors which can be influenced by surgery, in particular the total mesorectal excision for the development of a loco-regional recurrence.
Echocardiography has so far lacked uniform standards for the documentation of findings.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Declining incidences of active tuberculosis in the developed world have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most deadly infectious disease in the world.
In the developed world, factors such as immigration movements, increasing impoverishment, and the rise of immunosuppressed patients, particularly from the HIV epidemic, are helping to maintain a reservoir of tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disorder associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests on the skin and mucosa.
Ocular involvement is present in about 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18) in literature.
The discovery of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
As with other diseases, asymptomatic processes are also known in endocarditis (18, 19, 20, 21), but clinically symptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its initial description increasingly touches areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear to be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to have a significant influence on the residence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper skin layers.
This overview will outline molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for the use of IL-7 in dermatology.
The suitability of high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, omniscan) for contrast-assisted magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumours and the ability of dynamic studies at this dose to assess the response to preoperative chemotherapy were assessed.
The present paper aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research streams with relevance for everyday competence are outlined in the first part:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which aspects of the six research currents interlink with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical studies show a decrease in local tumor control as the total treatment time of fractional radiotherapy increases.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Therefore, targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment could potentially lead to significant advances in radiooncology.
In a brief overview, the possibilities of minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways, or by pharmacological inhibiting tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only method currently established is to carry out radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. B. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or Compensation for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory reaction probably plays an important role in pathogenesis but also diagnosis finding and prognosis estimation of acute coronary syndrome.
We evaluated 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour of admission and at the interval of 4-24h with regard to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biocite, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg / dL).
All patients were observed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome.Results:
The cumulative event rate in patients with positive CRP and TNT 42 days after discharge was 62.5% compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
Logistic regression with respect to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24h), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in an independent influence of TnTs (cutoff 0.1 µg / L, p = 0.048, odds ratio = 7.5) and CRPs (Cutoff 0.862mg / dL, P = 0.026, odds Ratio = 5.3).
Sensitivity / specificity for diagnosis AMI were 69.6% / 75% for TnT and 12% / 72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3% / 68.2% for TNT and 68% / 71% / CRP respectively in the 4-24h course.
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little help for acute infarct diagnostics.
However, the assessment of the prognosis of patients by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4-24h after intake and thus significantly improved.
A 51 / 2 year old girl with an optic glioma and the resulting internal hydrocephalus developed a progressive ascite 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
High protein content was found in the liquor and ascite fluid.
For the first time, a disorder of the blood-CSF barrier was found as a cause of the increased cerebrospinal fluid protein by means of CSF protein electrophoresis.
Ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary conduction with low rate of postoperative complications.
However, in case of liver damage with portal hypertension, the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion conduit bleeding is increased.
While diagnosis is simple, different therapy options are available.
Usually the source of bleeding lies in the stoma in varicose dilated vessels, so that a local sclerosation with 3% ethoxysclerol or the stopping of the bleeding vessel is offered.
Resection of the varicentric conduite fraction is an option in life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, consideration should also be given to lifting the conduit.
Malignancy must be excluded as a cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - whose detection can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterized solid tumors:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations associated with clinical parameters such as the recurrence of meningioma or malignant progression of astrocytomas are known species-specific.
The focal progression, particularly typical for gliomas, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also co-determined iatrogenic by radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman introduced herself to mitral cap prosthesis as dyspnoea increased due to thrombosis.
The patient had a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) for mitral stenosis III.
3 years later, there was a valve thrombosis, which caused a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have increasingly been better understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the release of carcinoma cells from the epithelial bandage by loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, and entry into the blood or blood stream. Lymphatic system.
Intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenetic factors, which can lead to degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
Endothelial cell adhesion, vascular system exit and angiogenesis induction form further important steps in the metastasis process.
Moreover, when a tumor cell enters circulation, it will only survive if it escapes immunological defense.
With the systematic identification of tumor antigens, new possibilities of immunotherapy measures have opened up.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrineal cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is believed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasia.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 manifests most frequently between the ages of 20 and 35. Age, mainly due to hyperparathyroidism and / or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies looked at the reduction of endothelial cell density after penetrating keratoplasty using different methods of preserving donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic because, despite long-known dynamic cell loss, very variable follow-up intervals were summarized.
The aim of this study was to carry out long-term endothelial findings on the same dates, taking into account 2 different conservation techniques.
Patients with long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a varying risk of perioperative thromboemboli requiring continuation of prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of clotting inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective procedures, coumaringabe is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively, in emergency procedures, the need for vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution arises.
Operations in patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less problematic as the heparine effect resolves within a few hours upon discontinuation.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
Transmission of the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany is estimated at 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems with the identification of patients, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
In order to avoid these problems, the number of multiple sclerosis patients diagnosed was recorded through a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of possibility to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent aggregation of the results of the interrogation of the individual groups of doctors resulted in a number of approx. 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "MS in question" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how the emergency medical care takes place and whether relevant findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce more growth factors in the area of ​ ​ the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be considered a new promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, which can be expected to be used clinically in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the GP.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is crucial for diagnosis and therapy.
Whereas in the 1970s the doctor's style of conversation was regarded as a personality variant, current empirical studies on the doctor-patient conversation suggest that the physician's conversational behavior should be understood as an interactive process, in which both communication partners (physician-patient) coordinate their conversation behavior.
Training programmes to improve basic psychosomatic competence in general practitioners often show little success as they do not take sufficient account of the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the center of the Düsseldorf training and training program for psychosomatic basic care.
The training concept and experiences with it are presented and discussed in conclusion.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All these sources are only partially transferable to everyday clinical practice.
Programming the speech processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in young children, especially determining the stimulation level corresponding to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
It is important to avoid over-stimulation, as this can have a traumatic effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyse the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL- and hearing thresholds established at the postoperative speech processor setting in 27 carriers of three different implant types.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold in practice provides an applicable, objective tool for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants irritated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as the percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed in some cases large deviations from the effective thresholds determined by behavioral audiometry.
Thus, no reliable and simple computational determination of the MAL and the hearing threshold was possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, together with an intraoperative function control, can contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be tested.
However, the determination of the exact MAL will have to be done by another, preliminary behavioral audiometric method.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red portions of a multicoloured jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, there was a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction, which could be delimited from a real lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be the result of dermal-allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
Therapy of choice is a surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the kidney area by means of fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a chicken egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland, protruding bud or warzenhoflose, had developed in the left anterior armpit line for 8 years.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desired.
Damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur in connection with endoprosthetic surgery.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complications as well as the applied therapy are described.
Vascular status of extremities should be established before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency to subjective certainty, which lose their strange character as an object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusion arises are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure of updating, which weighs on the imaginations and increases in psychotic constitutions, is a prerequisite for delusion.
To this must be added the failure of de-actualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by a case study, which start from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other delusions and to the conditions of chronification.
Inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal respiratory impairment due to thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, there was a cauliflower-like tumor in the anterior septal cartilage area that was fully resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Using an overview of the relevant literature, differential diagnoses are discussed.
The therapy of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore present possibilities of examination of finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers with the color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels with the color Doppler system used by us is technically possible.
As a result, we found that the presentation was possible in all subjects studied (n = 10).
As an example, it is also shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this magnitude can be detected by the method - with the appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for reimplantation of a cardioverter / defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with battery depletion of the pulse generator and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the functional life of the stifled implant system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the application of intrathoracal visualization systems enables the execution of operations on the mitral valve via a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep and musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses respectively.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Causally, trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role.
Preferred localizations are the strain and the near-stem limb proportions.
By combining different imaging techniques, the number of differential diagnoses can be limited to a few, in addition to the size and extent determination of the tumor.
If in earlier years surgical resection had a monopoly position, adjuvant therapy measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are given more and more importance.
Mutating and subsequent functional impairment are only justified in the event of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological therapy in combination with a temporary exacerbation-oriented anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, system therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response of topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant antihistamine therapy, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used in microbial superinfections.
Exacerbation can often be successfully countered phototherapeutic, in particular by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapy drugs such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or represents only in a few exceptional cases a therapeutic alternative.
The present case describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with a watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-stressed nasal breathing impairment in the ENT department of the BWK Ulm for clarification.
The clinical examination as well as the CT scan of the sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left nasal cavity and apparently emanated from the middle nasal duct.
The tumor was resected by midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological review revealed the diagnosis of a neuroma.
On the basis of this case study and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method of lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than in surgical treatment procedures of lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse, but they sometimes lead to considerable impairments.
The most severe complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding, and transverse myelitides.
This must be taken into account in the indication of chemonucleolysis and in the education of patients.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated by cryosurgery.
The granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and less stressful treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative to systemic treatment with dapson.
For the first time, the effectiveness of psychosomatic-dermatological consiliar activity was examined in greater detail in this study, based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic consiliar / liaison services.
The extent of compliance by treatment recommendation was assessed and its relationship checked with possible influencing factors such as frequency of call contacts, preset attitude and satisfaction with consultation, and clinical and demographic characteristics.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of a total of n = 69 patients with a recommendation for action, a compliance rate of 78.3% was found, with a rate of 69% for the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of contacts have any influence.
Only one interview was conducted in 70.5% of the cases.
Compliance was promoted by a positive preset to the consultation as well as a pleasant conversation experience.
Overall, therefore, with relatively little time and effort, a high degree of effectiveness could be achieved.
A 29-year-old patient with an unusual pigment mark of the face is reported.
In the clinical aspect, the pigment lesion corresponded to a naevus spilus, in histological diagnostics, the existence of multiple blue naevi could be assured, in addition, there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the Melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus proves to be the unusual combination of a lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than can be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss, and ventilation.
Changes in Starling forces - in particular vascular permeability - may play a role here, without these having been further investigated so far.
The discussion on the results of open-surgery procedures on the spine, especially surgery-related complications, e.g. B. the so-called In the past, post-discotomy syndrome has led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, particularly for the treatment of lumbar lumbar disc herniation.
The percutaneous nucleotomy techniques are techniques based on different intradiscale diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as: Discography, retroperitoneal disc window or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscale laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgery procedures have been developed since the 1970s for clinical use.
The results in patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to nearly 100% good, very good results depending on the author and study.
It is striking that the prospective randomised studies, which have comparison groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here, the results of intradiskal treatment procedures are more often evaluated more critically and with lower success rates than e.g. T. retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large numbers of cases, but can not withstand hard scientific criteria of study design well.
Overall, the percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a partial area of lumbar intervertebral disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At this stage, percutaneous nucleotomy techniques need to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microchirgic methods.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today, VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their place in application after coronary intervention.
Published application success rate data for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% up to 100% each.
The haemostasis times are 5-13 ', 2-4', 11-19 'and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems showed a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all have documented a significant decrease in haemostasis time.
The increased well-being of patients is essentially due to the lock removal immediately after coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and possibly epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula from the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also removed the internal membrane limitans (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina for some time.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomised studies comparing thrombolysis and prim ‰ r dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left leg block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, a pr ‰ hospital time of > = 12 h, or an unknown pr ‰ hospitalisation time.
In order to describe these patient groups and compare the influence of lysis and prim ‰ r dilation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died 5 days after first symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis in liver coma.
The serological diagnosis revealed cured hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and a superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis only postmorally detected).
This has led to protracted fat embolism (over the surface) in the pulmonary stream with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
The tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with other-cause dementia and 36 cognitively inconspicuous control subjects.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total score in the mini mental-state test 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these subjects compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer's patients, there was no quantitative relationship between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or the cerebral perfusion deficit determined with SPECT.
The results indicate that tau may also be elevated in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, a total of 16 patients with autoimmune disease have been described as having unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically implanted subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustulations.
The present paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem after reconstructive vascular interventions.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as the underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival time of intimate cells resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples from 25 primary and 14 residual oselesions of coronary and peripheral origin were tested by TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia was more correlated with re- than with primary stenosis, due to increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As a key finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL + cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological characteristics for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
On the other hand, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two types of plaque (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis / cell;
Thus, our data indicate apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying form of cell death with differences between the two lesion types in significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimate hyperplasia, commonly seen in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primary or secondary in the skin.
Cytotoxic lymphocytes are followed by a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotox lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbial (infectious) endocarditis (IU) is estimated at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been rising continuously for years.
The prognosis is essentially dependent on rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the usually diagnostic pioneering clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis require either the termination of an untargeted antibiotic therapy and a review of the blood culture techniques used or the application of serological / molecular biological techniques to identify the causative agent.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with a potentially toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations at the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolic disease, so that they usually constitute an independent surgical indication, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favourable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg / ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolism is associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolism is not a contraindication to surgery with the cardiopulmonary machine if primary cerebral hemorrhage has been excluded by means of a cranial computed tomogram and the operation is performed early before the formation of a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 h).
Significant prognosis improvement through early surgical intervention has also been demonstrated for disease processes complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially in the wake of acute valve insufficiency), the occurrence of acute renal failure, a claptrap infection of primary aortic valve vegetations on the anterior mitral sail, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, as the large, "cystic" brain ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections where either an increased or decreased amount of fluid is found.
4. Irregular contours of the back.
With the Infection Protection Act, the system of notifiable diseases in Germany is put on a new basis.
There will be reporting of certain diseases in case of suspicion, illness or death (essentially by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates which information must be provided by the notifiers with the notification.
It also determines which information may be forwarded by the health department.
In particular, in the case of suspected reports or the notification of pathogen evidence, not all information required to be transmitted will already be available through the notification, so the health department must carry out investigations in these cases itself in order to be able to transmit the relevant information.
The health authorities also have the task of merging the incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier to compile the information required for the health department.
The transmission to the RKI will then be via the competent national authority designated by the country.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer sufferers tend to suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions, leading to a significant loss of quality of life if treatment is inadequate or missing.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly severe effects on the patient and his relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy available from various organizations, these are often not sufficiently implemented.
This contribution therefore comprehensively represents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative care.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site of essential haemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases lead laboratory analytically to reduced values of the hepatic synthesized hemostase factors and signs of increased turnover of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In compensated haemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of hamostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxes, clinical bleeding usually occurs with more or less consumption coagulpathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like constellation of findings and only exceptionally thromboembolism.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after seamless corneal cataract surgery.
In the context of fall prevention, a routine review of the medication is called for.
A random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age examined the frequency of prescribing medicinal products that may increase the risk of falling by triggering dizziness.
Between the individual heart centers, the amount of bleeding varies up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogenic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
The use of allogenic transfusions is reduced by avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerance of low haemoglobin, use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol.
Perioperative maintenance and rapid recovery of normothermia significantly improves haemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent subject at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
Facial and maxillo-facial surgeons in the EU have achieved this objective in 1989 with tenacity and hard work.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussion of the substantive issues among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to its action, the MKG surgery is today, at the end of the 20th century. In 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists recognized as an independent field of expertise.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
But carrying fungi into the middle ear can cause serious complications.
Therefore, especially preoperatively, a rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is absolutely necessary.
However, all antimycotic ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparators, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for IV infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and AlconBSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for eye surgery, were evaluated for their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter / defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The mean age was 64 + / - 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As a basic cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilatative cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 + / - 14%.
The indication for implantable cardioverter / defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and survival resuscitation in ventricle fibrillation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter / defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients, and an AV sequential or two-chamber Cardiovertor / Defibrylator in 42 patients.
25 patients were implanted with a subcutaneous patch or array system and 2 patients with an epicardial patch system, 92 patients had an abdominal site and 248 had a pectoral site.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in 33 patients (9.7%) over the course of the treatment.
Eighteen of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregates.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications in the two-chamber cardioverters / defibrillators was 12%, three times higher than in the single-chamber Cardioverter / Defibrillator at 4% (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed primarily by a routine X-ray, one quarter (24%) by clinical (inadequate treatment, pain) and one fifth (21%) with electrical parameters.
The efficacy of radiosynoviorthesis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, especially chronic polyarthritis, was studied.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography does not rotate an X-ray tube mechanically around the patient, but instead directs an electron beam to targets arranged semicircularly round the patient on which the actual x-ray radiation arises.
With this ultra-fast technique, it has become possible to create axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely map all structures of the cardiac with a location resolution < 0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered sectional images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional image of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary lime with EBT must be regarded as the currently most receptive non-invasive marker for the presence of a coronary atheromatosis, including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for evaluating the course after angioplasty and aortocoronal bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen under the condition of stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artefacts as well as overlaying of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, EBT has already made possible non-invasive, clinically assessable representations of coronary arteries, which may be optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has established itself as a vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established procedure of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for the examination of this vessel.
In the pre-operative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients were found to have a consistent result compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase, the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic proportion corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, postoperative adaptation to the coronartery current bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flux proportion.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography were confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularization result postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male hypertensive patients over the age of 60 who characteristically exhibit cystic median ecrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmatic dissections of intracranial arteries are an outspoken rarity.
Here, young patients with or without a history of immediate trauma predominate.
On the basis of a case of traumatic dissection of cerebri media artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmatic dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The paper shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old people's homes and nursing homes.
The adaptation should strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and accelerate the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, but rather it is the task of the governing bodies to develop and enforce home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
A phenotypic female newborn of the 37th is reported. SSW, which is under the image of renal insufficiency at 14. Day of life passed away.
The child exhibited normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and unusually strong diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic investigations secured the diagnosis of drash syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been one of the most common causes of child morbidity and mortality in Western industrial nations.
While accidents in older children and adolescents usually occur on the road and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and toddler age, which occur preferably during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively detect and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts have been reported which had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint.
In both cases, there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of the contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation and on the other by the fact that conventional techniques can only map one layer per heartbeat.
New developments in both MRI scans and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion across the entire cardiac muscle at a resolution of 2 mm.
As an example of such a mapping technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echo planar sequence with preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-assisted determination of perfusion to diagnose coronary diseases is enhanced by the variety of MRI methods used to determine cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood flow conditions of ruptured ligaments are an essential parameter, especially with regard to the chances of success of surgical care, the vascularization of the knee ligament should be presented in the present paper.
The special blood circulation situation was examined by microangiography on 21 corpse preparations.
This showed a supply of proximal by 1 or 2 main vessel strains, which preferentially ran in the ventral band portions.
Vascular density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal portions of the band, we would recommend the reconstruction of the ligament by fibrin gluing, which allows an atraumatic restoration without the risk of seamless vascular strangulation.
Every year in Germany approx. 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (approx. 75% of all heart operations) treated surgically.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, mainly the saphena magna vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive venous removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today saphenectomy is largely performed by continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open preparation of the saphena magna vein.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of any heart surgery follow-up treatment after coronarchirurgical procedures and reason for upgrading new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only slight limitation by the saphenectomy wound (s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the ventral thoracic wall area with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the M. pectoralis major, an ipsilateral symbol dydactylia, and occasionally associated other defects of the chest wall, mammary and mamma.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of common occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been reported so far.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
In this study, it should be investigated whether sICAM-1 and sE-Selectin levels can predict early impending sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very comprehensive.
However, the online offers of the various magazines and publishers are qualitatively and quantitatively very different.
In contrast to traditional publications, online publications offer many advantages, such as low production costs and fast, location-independent and time-independent availability of information.
One can assume that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but represent a useful addition to the previous information offer.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grab."
The present case study describes the case of a 52J ‰ patient who developed a second ‰ re aortoenteral fistula type 2 into a duodenum 33 months after implantation of aortic tube prosthesis.
The pr ‰ operative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of pr ‰ operative diagnosis and the 2 alternative operative therapy procedures, in situ reconstruction and extra anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of the PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Supporters believe that, from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not stand in the way of a PGD.
In view of this situation, a PGD has not yet been implemented in Germany.
The discussion, which has been fierce in Germany for a long time, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
On the basis of casuistics it was suggested that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracal pus herb.
In a prospective, clinical examination, this hypothesis should be reviewed.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fevers of unclear genesis (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C over a minimum of three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient evaluation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden abscedations, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
Profile geometry, a modern method for determining skin surface structure, is presented in the present paper.
With the help of a fast-curing plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, imprints of the skin corresponding to its negative image are made.
In the subsequent measuring technique, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
The measurement data can be analysed, stored and compared by means of a statistical programme.
We tested this method to detect possible improvements in the skin surface condition after applying oestrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The ratio of water distribution between serum and whole blood has been set at 1,2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes for converting serum alcohol into blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicentre study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in which blood sampling is ordered in connection with alcohol-related offenses, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases, the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. In 96% of cases, the difference between the ratio and the average is less than 3%.
Paradoxical embolism is well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure, and consecutive right-left shunt is typically based on an open oval foramen or atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic disease patterns of children that change during growth through reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is possible only through the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed by wrist pulses palpation, vascularity clinical evaluation and Doppler signal dissipation via wrist arteries after clinic delivery.
The emergency operations in all 10 children included fragment reposition and fixation with crossed K-wires via an extended access in the first step.
The subsequent assessment of the blood circulation revealed pulse recurrence (passer, dislocation-related vascular occlusion) in 2 of the 10 children.
In 8 of the 10 children the pulse stayed away, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency measure.
Intraoperatively, we saw vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In the case of adventitious strangulation (2 of these 5 children), the pulse conduction to the hand occurred immediately after separation of the connective tissue strangulating tissues.
In the case of intimate damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with venous patch plastic.
We saw a combined vessel closure (mechanical-functional closure) in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination the wrist pulses could be felt in 9 children, color duplex sonographically 9 children had a physiological signal, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the brachial, radial and ulnar arteries.
Late ischemic damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not observed in any of the children.
The evaluation of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of zero degrees (region 0-15 degrees) and a lateral normal pro- and supination.
The carrying joint axle was normal in all children in side comparison.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful for pediatricians, because the pathogen breeding succeeds only in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is at the earliest after 3-5 days.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-lying tumors.
The efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR-tocopherol acetate / d) against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg / D) in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison.
After three weeks of treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical parameters studied was observed with both vitamin E therapy (n = 42) and diclofenac treatment (N = 43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90min to 68min with vitamin E therapy and from 68min to 30min with diclofenac.
Ritchie's joint index declined from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac), respectively.
Grip strength increased in both vitamin E group and diclofenac group.
Similarly, a significant reduction in the severity of pain was observed in both groups, as assessed by a 10cm visual analogue scale.
The overall opinion of the doctor and the patient on the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two medicines.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E is a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even overblown if there is a fistula to the esophagus or the stomach.
Such observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as communicating bronchopulmonary anterior intestinal anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal pullout and by a Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly went into severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol / l, respectively) within a few weeks as part of intoxication with synthetic drugs ("ecstasy" and "speed").
With decompensated diabetic metabolic location (HbA1c initial 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party in the manifestation of the first ketoacidosis without adequate hydration.
The clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disturbances of consciousness with agitation or agitation. Hallucinations and persecution mania are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The courses were straightforward.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff Cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation is reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellowish discoloration, creasing and cracking in swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal denture dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
In a prospective study, 36 patients were treated for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus role on an outpatient arthroscopic basis and controlled according to a standardised protocol after 4 and 12 months.
It was found that the conventional radiological preliminary examination permits a statement of the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the herd were located in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, these could be achieved without ankle osteotomy, piercing the tibia or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy in concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes at the leading edge of tibia.
The low complication rate, short rehabilitation duration and objective and subjective good operation result make arthroscopy a serious alternative of upper ankle arthrotomy.
Acute heart failure includes, in addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock.
The former should be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while the latter is already larger in pulmonary edema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
Nevertheless, the mortality of a cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is > 85%.
In a double-blind study involving 31 subjects, cognitive performance disorders were quantitatively assessed by using a standardised and validated test procedure (SKT) following a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam.
The disorders were partially consistent with the clinical picture of moderate to severe pass-through syndrome, or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia with no brightening tendency occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident by the detection of coarse rotational nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam administration.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and finding distribution and for video conference applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a qualitatively very good representation of the extracranial carotid current line in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (ToF) technique, vessels without contrast agents can be represented.
The use of ultra-fast gradient echo sequences (GES) allows for a first-pass representation of carotides from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 seconds when injecting gadolinium intravenously.
The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed in the present paper.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast agent-assisted MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast agent (KM) injection and the matching of the sequence parameters to the relatively fast blood return from the venous sinus into the jugular vein should be considered.
First, the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries was determined on a model and in a computer simulation.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By gradual variation of location resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed in volunteers and some patients, which enables the clinical use of the CE-MRA in the field of extracranial carotid current line.
The best qualitative results were achieved with a double-dose technique at 2 ml / s injection rate.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further investigations on the optimal KM application in the very early state of the art are still pending.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures are the delay of the operation date until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program and appropriate patient selection and information.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drilling channels including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a transplant implantation.
In addition, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Postoperative measures include the immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, the early start of a movement program and regular clinical checks.
Based on the experience of the own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after anterior cruciate ligament surgery can be largely avoided if the mentioned measures are taken into account.
Within the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasia, surgical therapy options have important tasks.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring secretion flow and the reduction of pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination with all conservative therapy options.
In many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present paper describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in sick elderly people is one of the most common and least noticed diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or in home care.
Up to 60% prevalence of malnutrition is reported, depending on the type and composition of the population studied.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, to lack of energy and thus combined to general malnutrition.
For accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These allow for tailor-made nutritional therapy.
The main deficiency states in sick elderly people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospitalization, incurs huge health care costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in betagter, the problem of malnutrition will worsen.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as an independent disease and integrating it into the curriculum of the training of doctors and nurses.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows the miserable next to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor localization and gender of the tumor carrier as an independent prognosis factor.
In stratification according to the above prognostic parameters, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without miserable" differ significantly in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with melanoma > 2.5 - 4 mm thick on the head, neck, thorax and acne;
Men with melanomas of the same location > 1.5 - 4 mm thick and melanoma of the arms, legs and abdomen > 2.5 - 4 mmthick (except acral and genitoanal localisation).
The limits of the risk area with a forecast benefit can be further clarified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Driving licence applicants are not only required to have adequate eyesight, but also legally required to use it "reliably."
The Nystagmus patient strives for this by e.g. For example, a head-look forced posture or other compensation mechanisms.
However, these are exactly in accordance with the applicable investigation guidelines (Annex XVII, § § 9 a ff. StVZO) not allowed.
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated vellus hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retinated keratin and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma are multiplex histopathologically distinct and therefore represent distinct disease patterns.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
By molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be histologically represented by Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, e.g. T. ulcerated nodes.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen may also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with a BA with multiple cutaneous nodules and bony changes.
All symptoms of the disease were resolved during treatment with erythromycin.
Stabilization and ventral column spondylodesis were performed in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries by thoracoscopic technique.
Increased experience has significantly reduced the operating times.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open procedure.
Our own experiences prove the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
The main advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and shorter inpatient stay.
Objective To operate Exercise stable osteosynthesis of humerus with solid intramedullary locking marrow nail in non - drilled technique.
A mechanical irritation of the supraspinate tendon due to a narrowing of the subacromial space is considered as a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method to improve the spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and to assess the acromia form in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
Acromion form was contrasted with Bigliani classification in conventional X - ray image.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis refers to a number of diseases which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, the latter can be No pathogen detected in the group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to relapse, long course and may additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumours and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
Histological distinctions between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis do not exist.
In a demographically ageing society, social work for the elderly is not justified per se, but must prove its social usefulness in the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and triggered the search for a more consensual and attractive performance profile in the fields of social work for the elderly.
With the method of direct immunofluorescence we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L chains, an early component of complement C1q and discrete C3 deposits along the obtained elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the papillary stratum, at the dermoepidermal boundary, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this respect, our case can be considered unique in literature.
The hand is extremely exposed in daily use and thus also highly exposed to injuries.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the varied functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor function and stability.
In the case of the most serious injuries, only residual or replacement functions are very often to be gained.
The complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hands.
In principle, comprehensive primary care is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is in the foreground.
The destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed as far as possible.
This is followed by microsurgical recostruction of the vessels and nerves.
In exposed bones or tendons, the skin coat is replaced by a pedicled or free microchirugic skin flap.
In the case of long periods of ischemia, this concept is abandoned in the sense that blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing result of a complex hand injury, each function of the hand recovered or created counts.
It is therefore not responsible to provide such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local conditions a special department.
Treatment of symptomatic multi-vessel coronary disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large randomised studies with comparable clinical success and risk.
According to PTCA, however, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long-term, following the BARI study in diabetic patients, lethality was lower in the operated group.
The individual therapy recommendation by the attending physician has also proved to be an important factor in the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomised studies.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare disease pattern of parakeratosis variegata occurring after a period of 4 years following pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is reported.
In order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes and their relationship to the low-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T-cell type, we conducted histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases had characteristic histological changes as well as predominantly lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor within both changes could not be established.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without reference to the low-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the edge of the resecta (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and unambiguous as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids, which in our experience are particularly useful for mammaexcisates:
1) Radiopake threads, intraoperatively applied, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsat.
When sevoflurane is in contact with the CO2 absorbers of the anaesthesia circuit parts, compound A is formed, which could have a nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers aiming to analyse the effects of Compound A on renal function.
A total of three studies in subjects investigated the effects of 8 hours of anaesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% vol. 2 L / min were used.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from renal tubular cells in the urine of the subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent studies then found either no relevant or even no changes in renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3 Vol in subjects. % sevoflurane administered over 4 hours with a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L / min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In transferring these results to clinical practice, account must in any case be taken of the experimental nature of the anaesthesia carried out in these studies.
Although the topic of low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in volunteers, as well as the results of new clinical studies, suggest that renal function after low-flux surgery behaves in a similar way to isofluran.
So far, there are no published experiences in the therapy of paraphilias (paedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in the German-speaking world.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelinacetate during a study period of 12 months.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive acts and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died of suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic procedures appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its potential carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined five different intraoperative heat measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and staff first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapuls CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible both by phlebography and duplex sonography with an almost 100% certainty.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both procedures are widely available.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnosis, but duplex sonography has become of paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific issues, phlebography cannot be dispensed with.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two procedures is practiced as a "golden partnership" when comprehensive documentation is required.
The chronic rejection reaction is today the most important yet unresolved problem of kidney transplantation.
The objective of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the graft remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we examined 9 explanted transplantations of opposite-sex donors with the help of in-situ non-radioactive hybridization (nish).
We used biotinised centromerspecific DNA probes for human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study showed that even several years after transplantation the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the gender of the donor.
The only receptor cells detectable in the graft were the inflammatory cells composed primarily of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Dopplersonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Council of the Federal Medical Association as one of the methods shortening the waiting period until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey should clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experience has been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used in the sense of decision-making aids for the detection of brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, 5 times "yes" was ticked.
The meeting revealed that the investigators had deliberately communicated borderline situations in which e.g. T. also the conditions were not completely met.
In none of these cases has ultrasound been used to detect brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision support for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further secure the diagnosis, less often than the sole method to shorten the waiting time.
The endogenous formation of CO is exclusively due to the microsomal hemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (H0-2) and in a stress-inducable isoform (H-1 or heat shock protein 32).
Therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of stress-inducing isoform of enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was studied in the present paper.
Glycerin leads to the transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the corneal layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.
Especially when used in O / W emulsion, it improves the horny layer hydration to a considerable extent and significantly above the urea effect.
In addition, it promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus the corneal shielding.
Especially in the case of long-term application, the deformation of the skin can be increased by glycerol in the intake test.
The roughness of the skin surface is also affected by glycerine-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
Glycerin, when used in O / W emulsions, also leads to a protective effect against surfactant action and against lipophilic pollutants.
This may be due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerin leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis towards the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerin, similar to urea, can lead to an improvement in drug penetration.
Objective To operate objective To stabilize posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by posterior bone block and capsule plastic.
Complications of long-term course resulting from degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to extended surgery times and increased operative trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletal conduits / T-graft configuration).
Material and Methods:
Between 3 / 96 and 7 / 99, 405 patients with multiple-vessel coronary disease were completely arterially revascularized in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic internal arteriae, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracica artery and radialartery artery, and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%) the implantation of the two arterial grafts was performed in T configuration.
On average, 4.1 + / - 0.9 coronary vessels per patient were anastomosed.
Hospital lethality was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after taking the radialartery were not recorded except for temporary paresthesia.
At 1 week postoperative angiographic control, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenosis > 50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of multi-vessel coronary disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment procedures for periprosthetic femoral fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of knee joint are discussed.
A new method of supplying such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has been given a key position within the neuromonitoring, although the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron cannot be registered directly or only with a time delay due to the brain pressure.
A prerequisite for a reliable brain pressure measurement are specific properties of brain pressure probes, which are to be examined in the following.
These should be analyzed and categorised from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functioning and measuring properties.
Partial sphincterectomy is practiced in the cataract surgery with very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosing ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults has been increasingly researched, the quality of living of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents is only recently addressed.
In this paper, works published in the literature on the health-related quality of life of children are evaluated in terms of research priorities and methods.
The overview shows that empirical work is scarce so far, the existing measuring instruments for the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the measurement of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were assessed and compared with a control group during the 5 days prior to onset of acute renal failure.
In 1957 Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasio because of skin changes, which due to the available biographical material must be regarded as a starting rhinophyma.
Throughout his entire artistic creative phase, the artist's involvement with aspects of plastic surgery, especially in the nasal area, can be demonstrated.
As a founder of Pop Art, Warhol contributed significantly to shaping modern society with his complete oeuvre, thereby also influencing our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen) program, which was specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and liver living donations.
Experience with the program has so far been available for > 50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT scans.
After the adjuvant and palliative effects of active non-specific immunotherapy on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immune therapy.
It involves gene transfer that can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma we offer:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens by peptides or "naked DNA," vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transfited tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanomas.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results has not yet been accurately estimated.
In 309 inpatients treated with talk psychotherapy and followed up one year later, it is shown to what extent raters in the scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES can be influenced by patient defences measured with personality test validity scales MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen test:
The tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social DESIRABILITY"), and the trend to appear inconspicuous-normal.
Their relative improvements (effect strengths rating scales) are lower as their openness increases (validity scales). - Stationary talk psychotherapy strengthened the defense in aggraviating and diminished it in dissimulating patients.
In spite of early conservative and then timely surgical therapy of the congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, approx. 25% relapses and residual deformities requiring treatment reported.
The main cause appears to be the lack of concentric reposition and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
Forefoot adduction and supination are the most common deformity.
From the experience of 94 operated relapsed / residual clump feet (patients < 10 years of age), the age-dependent operative procedure is presented.
Beyond the 8th to the 10th Metatarsal osteotomies, correction after Ilizarov with external fixator and as ultima ratio triplearthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show pronounced variability of their clinical morphs.
We report a 77-year-old patient with a pedicled, lobular, intradermal nevous cell nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-shaped appearance we propose the expression "Nävus corymbiformis."
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in transfusion, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge for anaesthetists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative self-donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anesthesia procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and automatic transfusion of autologous wound blood, make it possible to avoid transfusions of allogeneic blood even in patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Geburgehaus and the midwifery institute, is considered one of the founders of scientific birth medicine.
He focused his research and teaching on the empirically tangible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis adds up to his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of pelvic measurements and inspection of the Michaelis lozenge named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis of risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness distinguished his research:
He self-critically published medical failures, critically examined new theories.
So he was the first in Germany to confirm the teaching of Semmelweis on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
Out of desperation over the death of many female patients in childbirth, which was partly due to him, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-known arousal conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can trigger temporary stimulus effects in humans in circumscribed cortex areas.
New applications for functional anatomical questions on speech lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations on safety of use are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that occur mostly in the course of the distal intrapemporal section of the nerve, pregrow after extra-temporal and then be noticed as a space requirement extracranial.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, progressive sound sensation disorder on the left, and mild peripheral facial paresis without lacrimal secretion deficit.
The neuroma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Via an extradural "middle fossa approach," the tumor was removed without injury to the facial motor nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neuroma of the N. petrosus major without affect of the facial motor nerve.
A status epilepticus (SE) occurs when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, the current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients; in case of failure, phenytoin and phenobarbital is used.
The refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialised intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate procedure is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternative active substances.
For the treatment of an outdated rupture of the anterior tibial tendon, either a longing transposition or a longing transplantation is recommended.
A case study is used to describe the operational supply of an augmented reverse plastic;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with good functional outcome.
Reverse plastic has the advantage that there is no functional loss compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies in many diseases.
For the detection of this parameter in intensive care patients, the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well defined and tested in large prospective studies, serves above all.
In contrast, ventilative and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the significance of these diseases.
Sepsis and MODS, which are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with impairment of autonomous function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of loss of neurohumoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems increasingly attractive in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the head hair.
The medical history showed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed excessive copper content as the cause of green discoloration.
On the basis of our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by swimming water in our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTX).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), Expected and experienced changes according to HTX.
In the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
Already 6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of transplanted patients found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and health condition (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, 76% of patients showed a high level of satisfaction with their health condition and 51% with physical performance.
Although patients considered their mental health to be good even before HTX, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher levels after one year (preop.
Range (R) = 3,78 vs. 12 months postop.
Before HTX, quality of life correlated best with health status (r = 0.61, p < 0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health condition (r _ 0.76, p _ < .01).
According to HTX, the areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities only improved in about 28% of patients.
90% experienced one or more symptoms after transplantation, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure as early as 6 weeks after HTX, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental health significantly improve.
Despite too high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplants are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered isolated craniocerebral trauma (SHT) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma and contusion haemorrhage [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)] after a bicycle crash:
The space-demanding hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values necessitated a barbiturate coma for 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed on 8. Day after trauma a septic lung failure.
The patient showed a protracted course and could not be transferred to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive restriction of mobility in both hip joints (extension / flexion:
0 degree / 10 degree / 20 degree, left:
Abduction / Adduction:
10 degrees / 0 degrees / 25 degrees, left:
Ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker Type IV) were seen in the pelvic survey and computed tomography.
The HO were removed two times each via a Smith-Petersen access two years after the accident.
HO recurrence prophylaxis was performed by single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg / day) for 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints is 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection as follows:
20 degrees / 0 degrees / 30 degrees, left:
Abduction / Adduction:
30 degrees / 0 degrees / 40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can carry out light activities as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene encoding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
By means of PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes could be amplified, along with that of some yeast and mould fungi.
By hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides, dermatophytes and Candida albicans were identified.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the demarcation of the dermatophytes against the yeast and mould fungi.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was verified on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as selected animal and plant DNA.
In order to evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routine skin and nail samples were examined with PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected with PCR in 35 and with culture in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples.
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal levels is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here.
The ulnar discus and scapholunar ligament injuries are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis has been increasingly applied in forensic practice, archaeology and evolutionary and population genetic studies over the last decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special regard to the noncoding hypervariable regions is described.
It also discusses the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biology studies.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their scope and structure are expounded.
Results of experimental work with the aim of obtaining mitochondrial DNA from ground-based teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as own observations.
Microperimetric studies after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The operative effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for representing the intraarticular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows direct representation of labrum lesions by distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow assessment in the crucial cranioventral sections.
Labrum lesions can be divided into different clinically relevant stages with the MRA.
In addition, the presentation of concomitant lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress oedema) is possible.
In a study conducted by us with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
There have been no complications to date in the more than 100 arthrographies that have now been performed.
Based on this experience, the MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnosis of labrum lesions.
In this review we present the technique and results of the MRA method we used.
It was found that the varicene wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the venous wall below a still intact venous valve.
The change of the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength lay in the vein wall and here in particular on the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the summary of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and the subsequent variable remodelling of the vein cannot be confirmed; rather, there is a change in the venous wall and thus a valve insufficiency.
Artery injuries as a direct sequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be absent in the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries.
The hypothenar-hammer syndrome represents a closure of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapy approach possible in the first place.
In this study, the medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery is to be reviewed.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combination of anesthesia initiation and anaesthesia maintenance with propofol results in a reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in Total Intravenous Anaesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anaesthetic medicines or techniques.
This paper shows how best to take advantage of the anti - emetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cortex cerebri and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed by means of results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol about the incidence reduction of PONV in clinical practice are reviewed.
The prediction of the postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined maxillofacial surgery-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw by a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants is rarely included in the preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept for 23 patients was determined on the basis of the preparation of a rapid prototyping medical model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special regard to anterior aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the operative and / or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the achieved functional and aesthetic result.
The profile prognosis with video imaging provides a useful decision support in the planning of the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw, in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of the maxillary advance, insertion direction of enossal implants and type of supra construction.
A large-nodular multicentre juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, the unusual clinical and histological aspect of which initially did not allow diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression of more than 2 years with the change of the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells as well as the lack of detection of specific cell organelles were able to secure the nature of the disease.
For the treatment of rheumatic diseases, thymus preparations are offered on the German pharmaceutical market.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with deficient and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as investigations that do not allow a scientifically based statement due to a short study duration and low number of patients.
A medically acceptable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with a sufficient positive benefit-risk assessment according to the state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the hepatica dextra artery in a 64-year-old patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, there had been repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to find in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapy option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insultes have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are quickly recognized and treatment is initiated within 3 hours after the onset of the initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
Symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number will be achieved through intensified training, taking into account both the public and emergency medical staff.
The current standard of treatment in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure management, and the therapy of hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia.
For maintenance treatment with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingual-administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with oral methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a 24-week study period.
In the randomised study, the target parameters were defined as retention rate (= percentage of patients who stayed in the study program over the entire duration of the study and finished it as planned), supplemental consumption, and duration of stay.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a tendency towards retention rate (p = 0.06) in favour of the methadine-treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n = 20) tended to be higher in 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated (n + 20) group.
There was no significant difference between the two during the course of treatment as regards additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine.
Methadone was the more successful substance in terms of duration of stay in the study (p = 0.04).
How important and meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional treatment failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the likelihood of occurrence of hematogenic metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined in terms of clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node infestation and pleasure habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25 / 139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed according to the treatment concept after completion of radiotherapy.
10 / 139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage."
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77 / 139 (55%) the disease could be controlled loco-regionally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62 / 139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor disease, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly co-determined by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (P < 0.012), T-category (p > 0.03) and smoking (p ≤ 0.0285).
The median survival time of patients with loco-regional treatment failure was 17 months.
At the time, 81% of locally controlled patients were still alive.
Remote metastases were detected in 23% (14 / 62) of the locoregional uncontrolled patients, compared with only 4 / 77 (5%) of locoregion cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and remote metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached plateau after 24 months.
The locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indication of the likelihood of the development of distant metastases.
Failure of therapy is caused by the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multiline detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension is reached in volume acquisition and location and time resolution in CT.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current therapy of cross-otter bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of partly threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the likelihood of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of repair and reconstruction procedures on the distal stretching apparatus of the knee joint.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixator was applied in assembly form A and in 23 patients in mounting form B.
4 patients had a deep infection caused by the fixator in 2 cases.
The 63 patients who were treated with the MPT fixator carried the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the lig. patelle in caudal debris fractures were investigated, as well as 12 patients with transossseous suture fixation in lig.patellae in the case of tears and tears at the lower patellapol or suture adaption in ligamentous rupture in which no other care was taken at the knee joint apart from the extensor surgery.
In 2 patients, the result was considered normal by the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetic, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a tensile strength deficit of 10-20% in the operated leg compared to the opposite side.
To sum up, the EPTT with the MPT fixator has proved its worth with continuity-restoring interventions on the distal stretching apparatus of the knee joint and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial failure with wire or synthetic strip material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
More recent diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible today to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies the benefits of which have been studied in clinical studies.
Based on the case studies of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous haemorrhagic vesicles occur at the beginning of the light-rich season recurrently until adulthood, which heal scarred.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiological department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central method of recording in the X-ray diagnosis of oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery is the panoramic layer image.
The reduction in dose requirements continues to be achieved through further developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as: B. Sensors or storage films have become possible.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional recording methods make imaging by means of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indispensable in numerous clinical questions of oral, maxillofacial and facial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows cortical changes to be reflected due to the shortening of the measuring times.
For certain questions, such as: B. Changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures allow image-assisted functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is now used inpatient and outpatient, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are particularly important for patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotionality or, due to character resistance, difficult to achieve in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with short examples and other methods are pointed out.
Active factors include the connection of the affects to the vegetative and arbitrary nervous system, as well as the close connection of psychological and physical processes, which especially exists at the beginning of life, which connects to the respective experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects.
In the further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire symbolic and important significance for therapy.
The relationship of the body-oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy, especially psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and previous experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence the career choice and personal life plans.
Although the psychotherapeutic activity leaves a great deal of room for the individual to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to realize a family model corresponding to them and their partners.
Three models are presented and described in their effects.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships in their education and training as to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
Advanced heart failure is becoming increasingly important within the cardiovascular disease population with a 0.1% prevalence.
The 6- to 12-month probability of survival is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the therapy of choice in medically treated refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have developed.
Conventional drug therapy was improved by the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anticongestively effective beta blockers.
The surgical therapy of advanced heart failure has been extended by the introduction of high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assistance hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricle reduction plastics, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These treatment options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores on the basis of national and international patient registers.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopedic University Hospital Bochum, the rise in TLA procedures is compared with manual therapeutic procedures in the period of one year.
In contrast, 122 manual therapeutic handles were carried out on HWS, GWS and LWS by the respective ward physicians with completed further training.
While TLA focused on the main predilection site of the disease (pseudoradicular HWS and LWS syndromes), manual therapy focused primarily on secondary findings in other spinal floors in patients with the above-mentioned diagnoses or with post-discotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated mandibular tooth from the site of its installation into ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of the migration of a rescued lower premolar to the muscular process documented over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending mandibular branch to the muscle extension took place after the completion of root growth, after the 20th century. Year of life of the patient.
Neither radiological nor clinical reasons for such an extensive migration were found in this patient.
The incidence of prostate carcinoma as well as cases curatively treatable by radical prostatovesiculectomy is increasing.
The exact pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the stage classification and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since a standardised method for processing the preparations is lacking internationally, the comparability of various scientific studies is made more difficult.
The well-defined, rational conservation of the preparations, which we are proposing, is intended to remedy these problems and to improve the interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood-like increase in the requirements for documentation, performance measurement and quality control, require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
In the orthopedic clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Gießen, a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, particular attention has been paid to the clinical-scientific claims of the clinically active physician.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, surgical planning (scheduling of interventions, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and interventions), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server into MedXS, content and functions can be accessed simultaneously via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM) from the intranet or Internet.
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with the health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by non-specific neurological symtomas as well as facial dysmorphia signs.
However, the presence of congenital leucoderma (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered to be relatively typical and usually trend-setting.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a not to be underestimated cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially in young patients.
The therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
There is a manifest heart failure in individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM who are treated with medication according to standard treatment guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method to study a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures chromosomal and subchromosome-level alternations.
The question of the necessary patellar replacement in the context of total knee prosthetics is generally still very controversial.
In this context, we need to receive more information about the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just in comparison to the prosthetically supplied patella.
The fact that we have been doing patellar replacement only in special cases for almost 5 years has made available to us a patient material on which this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 fully prosthetic knees documented with 2-year follow-up, we carried out a targeted survey of the patellashift and tilt, first of all on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar conductive bearing, and compared the results to the range of movement achieved after 2 years and persistent pain symptoms.
Regular adaptation of the bony patella silhouette to the denture slide bearing was observed with compaction of the marginal bone contact zone with or without fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" based on their clinical follow-up because they had residual discomfort (n = 3) or mobility of only 90 / 0 / 0 degree flexion / extension or less (n + 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift greater than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with post-operative tilt greater than 15 degrees (N = 3).
Within this group, symptoms with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility were also correlated with a severe preoperative shift, also with a significant difference from the problem-free collective.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap course (16 mm / 39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial denture loosening.
After axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also became symptom-free and well mobile again, without any surgical intervention on the patella and although a considerable amount of residual tissue remained.
Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that a greater effort is justified for the recentration to achieve a residual shift below 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps during implantation that influence the kneecap course, e.g. A high quadriceps shift or a medially displaced refixation of the detached tuberositas are required.
On the other hand, a residual tilt up to 15 degrees is well tolerated because the non-prosthetically supplied patella has amazing adaptability to the denture glide bearing by removing bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative malposition, in which we had not made a replacement because of good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized kneecap course.
Whether there is an extended indication of patella replacement in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance programme of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for the external quality assurance measures.
By introducing a comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing clinic structures.
So far, measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes have been in the foreground.
In order to increase employee satisfaction and qualification, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Objective To avoid or eliminate compression to the nervous structures.
The present paper gives a review of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed in particular.
It is known that in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as in the liver in cirrhosis, defects of the respiratory chain occur increasingly.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasia is pathogenetically different from oncozytic neoplasia.
In addition, organ-dependent differences exist in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasia.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are preferentially found in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
Which molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for this is still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient with a longer-term parenteral diet.
Similar to the autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes of this patient are also due to a zinc deficiency of the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
It compares 53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people for their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The skin patients examined differ significantly from skin healthy people in the sense of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of tenderness is reduced in both sexes, the orgasm ability is highly significantly reduced in the female patients.
Psoriatic patients feel more impaired compared to patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been approached by their treating physician about their sexual life.
However, despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the physician for skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
The conventional X-ray image must still be regarded today as a basic examination in the clinical question of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bony inflammatory destructions, but also makes it possible to assess their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image can indicate a clinical relapsing situation via the collateral phenomena and directly and indirectly show the inflammatory increase in volume of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed presentation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR - offers highly specific information on some special issues, especially on the stem skeleton and on individual large joints, partly on the definitive diagnosis, partly also for the planning of operations.
This applies, inter alia, to the sacrum joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
Supplying open lower leg fractures II degrees and III degrees with simultaneous soft tissue damage nowadays involves a wide range of operative possibilities of primary osteosynthesis.
Via the external fixator, the undrilled marrow nail up to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this happens under the primacy of soft tissue cover.
It was only through the associated successes in recent decades that it was possible to significantly reduce the hitherto high rate of invasive amputations and infections.
If at first there were only individual case observations, the signs increased that these patients had frequent soft tissue problems at the lower leg from the relapsing swelling inclination to the ulcer cruris.
A clinical study using vein occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy volunteers showed that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
There are degrees of severity of this damage from a simple swelling tendency to the ulcer cruris, which become more important in clinical relevance as the time distance from the accident event increases.
In order to avoid further damage, also iatrogenic, stringent attention to the surgical guidelines in primary care is required, postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Objective To correct bony meta-epiphysal misalignments of tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of the shape and function of the limbs.
Muzins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and / or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive knowledge about their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent findings also suggest that muchin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present paper gives an overview of the gastrointestinal mucinantigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including own findings.
In recent years, the establishment of rheumatic centers in Germany has made it possible to network outpatient and inpatient areas with general practitioners, internal and orthopedic specialist rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists working in them, as well as acute and rehabilitation clinics.
In the long term, rheumatological control centers can help to further improve the cooperation between all physicians, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatic patients and ensure a continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic diseases in the sense of a comprehensive rheumatologic quality management in quantitative and qualitative terms.
Despite the increasing frequency of medical problems, knowledge of the type and frequency of treatment errors following thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the Medical Chambers of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert commissions found treatment errors.
In 95% the complaint concerned the surgeon, in 2% the anesthesiologist, in 3% both disciplines and once an ENT doctor.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine thyroid surgery.
Surgery-typical complications such as recurrent paresis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%) and postoperative haemorrhage (3%) as well as late relapse (1%) together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications, such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%) and left-behind nodules (4%) as well as scar problems (5 percent), accounted for 37% of the allegations, but 70% of treatment errors.
Only 11% of the identified treatment errors had educational deficiencies.
The detection of a treatment error was particularly common when re-surgery was required (p < 0.001), when the objective of the operation was not achieved (P < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by an error in the post-treatment process (p > 0.002).
The area of "Environment and Health" is characterised by an interdisciplinary character and a consequent high need for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes considerable problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform in this area.
Recognised indications are bilateral renal tumours, kidney tumours in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys, and in those with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after tumour nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Surgical strategic improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and work-bench surgery - can also save patients with multiple and advanced renal tumours more than 95% from nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-sustaining renal tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are recommending the extension of parenchyma-saving renal tumour surgery to a selected patient with contralateral healthy kidney (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinoma of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears small.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrence is infaust in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been most commonly reported in small cell bronchial carcinoma.
We report 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or a carcinoid of cervix uteri.
Background and question.
For the development of rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterial skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but above all low-impact.
In the following, one patient is reported to have experienced severe, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the resolved psoriasis flocks as part of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy of urolithiasis.
With largely the same technical principles, different lithotriptors have been developed.
In the current discussion are the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence, which make a corresponding metaphylaxis still meaningful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of the ESWL, among other forms of therapy, are still pending.
Following treatment of fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), clinically isolated acute corneal calcifications have been observed.
The hitherto unknown pathomechanism led us to the following investigations.
The joint occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case studies, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF-severity.
Various possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] with the help of the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and displayed after restriction digestion on a polyacrylamide gel by means of silver coloring.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwest German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 subjects (3.57%), the method chosen here, which only takes into account nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, as a differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
The chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic clarification.
That exceptions must apply, should prove the following case studies.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal / lateral patella acetate after a football match.
Arthroscopically, it was a firm, bony-shaped, bandaged hematoma that effortlessly combined with a haul of:
At the football match, there had obviously been bleeding by bruising or patella subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after arthroscopy, muscle atrophy quickly regressed.
Two-thirds of all rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and sustained effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data suggesting a longer-term effect (longer than one year) are presented.
Recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By differentiating the short-term effects of inflammation from the long-term effect on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical studies support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes, which are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop independently to a certain extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms represented elsewhere on this symposion.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and chains of 1-, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show marked intra- and interindividual variation on the sperm surface as well as different localization.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether the AM has functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or only represents "biological redundancy" or only the very last binding insurance.
The marking of sperm AM was modified by progesterone, human follicle fluid, disintegration of sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal glandula under the influence of adrenergic receptors with a wide range of effects.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, even levels during the day and an evening rise and nightly peak between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
In addition, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in both extracellular and intracellular space due to its strong lipophilic properties, independent of a receptor system.
The affinity to the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly great.
In dermatology, there are perspectives for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical application, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There are some findings on penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics for chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which can locate a source of inflammation if the focus is unclear, as the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT technology is given, and on the other hand in availability of high-specific radiopharmaculants, e.g. B. enable evidence of leukocytic infiltration.
Both approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological procedures, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which lead to inflammatory scintigraphy in the event of unclear findings.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has been established as a method of treating capillary infant hemangioma for a long time.
Surprisingly, however, so far detailed studies are missing that prove their effectiveness in the regularly subject to spontaneous regression tumors.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial space requirement due to post-traumatic bleeding and oedema, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated SHT and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, inflammatory "system reaction" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and dysfunction are usually survivable, but can be fatal in your combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic states after SHT are also understood as CNS interactions with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of an SHT on the rest of the organism should be compared with the effect of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-related perfusion disorders can cause prognostic hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole body inflammation reaction" affects blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the organism as a whole, as well as the influence of the currently applied therapy measures, are still insufficient and require further information.
Finally, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions, which do not directly support life and lead to an additional burden on the patient from the operating trauma, must also be reconsidered.
This thesis tries to summarize important aspects in this field.
For better delimitation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma, but also for early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human kallikrein 2 (HK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids.
Children with facial cleavage have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 Psychotherapy dropouts have been compared with 599 accomplices and examined for conspicuous personality traits.
They were also asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for dropping out.
As erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin an early childhood manifested, dominant hereditary dermatosis with partially circular rearing erythemas was described especially in families from the South African district of OudTshoorn.
The seasonal binding to the winter half-year and the characteristic histological multiform finding distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies on the efficacy of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localised and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the work reviewed reveals clear shortcomings.
This study should consider whether visual acuity decreases as a function of the time of presentation and whether these regulations place normal persons and Nystagmus patients at a disadvantage in the driving assessment.
Sudeck syndrome affects an limb after microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory reaction to an injury or surgery of an extremity.
His theory found no support because most of the medical profession believes that Sudeck syndrome is triggered by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of antiphlogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this paper, methods of applying the fast multilayer spiral CT for cardiac imaging by means of ECG synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
Computed tomography, in addition to the radiological examination procedures used in dentistry, enables a superposition-free representation of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the well-established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proven itself in further questions.
If the examination is carried out with a thickness of less than 1,5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jaw bone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the retina teeth can be assessed so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the retinated tooth can be delimited, orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, horizontal and vertical bone degradation shall be accurately determined.
The morphology and extension of benign cystic space requirements is detectable by CT.
Prior to intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all sepsis patients.
Case studies illustrate the symptoms of the SE.
The leading symptom is a clouding of consciousness to the point of coma.
Cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, generalized brain edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated immune responses of the organism to bacterial products as well as bacteraemia itself are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disorder in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycaemia, shock and ischemia, and liver and kidney failure can be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
As early adequate treatment of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, the SE has a special diagnostic significance as a possible initial symptom of the sepsis.
Despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and operative therapy, endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general conditions and reduced general condition has a ‰ extremely poor prognosis.
Films tell stories.
Especially those scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts are exciting.
Medical ethical conflicts do not only appear in medical series or disease representations, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, love movies, gangster and crime movies.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and are at the same time seismographs for the social relevance of medical ethical topics.
However, in the film ethical principles of decision making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the presented conflict situations is similar to a medical ethical case review and is a helpful supplement for the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the restenosis rate compared to the conventional PTCA resulted in stent implantation becoming the most common initial intervention.
This is why in-stent restenosis - especially the long-range form - is an important clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty on these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
Preclinical management of amputation injury places great demands on the rescue system.
Especially the initial care of the amputate in amputation injuries, in addition to the initial treatment of the injured, often decides on the success of the recovery measures.
The primary objective of the imaging diagnosis of the larynx is the analysis of submucous structures, which are not available for laryngoscopic assessment.
Consequently, the general rule is to make the imaging diagnosis of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of the endoscopic diagnosis.
The topographic-anatomical conditions of the skeleton, the internal structures and the surrounding area of the larynx will be represented synoptically.
By transpedicular stabilization with a screw - ring band system, the instability was eliminated with segmental function maintenance.
In recent years, new knowledge has been gained about the post-traumatic changes after craniocerebral trauma (SHT) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals that are intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
Within the framework of this paper, the more recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the principal pharmacological intervention possibilities are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are at different advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease progression pose a significant problem for oncological dermatologists.
The aim of the present paper was to review the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease of melanoma patients who were not treated.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been prophylactically taking minocycline for lung silicosis for over 3 years before symptomless blackened spots appeared on the face.
The other patient experienced gray-black spots on both lower legs after just 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser resulted in a regression of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are reviewed by the case examples.
Objective To eliminate the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area in recent years.
A major factor in this is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
In this study, the sensitive ability of the inferior alveolar nerve to regenerate after partial tumour-surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascular pedicled thoracicus longus nerve was investigated.
Sensation of pressure and pain could already be experienced for 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at least 7 months postoperatively.
The vascular pedicled thoracicus longus nerve is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging the defects of the inferior alveolar nerve caused by resection in tumor patients.
The use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-amino-phenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of deliberate overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, although a large number of overdose cases involve only a relatively small number of serious complications.
Severe liver toxicity is expected in any patient who has exceeded the standard dose and has a minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg / kg (7.5 g or 15 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, N-acetylcysteine treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, complete N-acetylcysteine treatment should be performed in any patient whose strength or timing of overdose is unknown, regardless of serum levels.
In all cases, N-acetylcysteine treatment should be continued if liver function deteriorates.
At the onset of signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be called in to ensure optimal therapy or immediate relocation in the event of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has significantly improved the fate of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be achieved through closer cooperation between the initiating hospitals and the special liver disease facilities.
Background and question.
Itching is a difficult therapeutic concomitant of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases.
Capsaicin, an alkaloid from the paprika plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option in recent years.
Capsaicin blocks unmyelinised, polymodal C and A nerve fibers after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation when applied topically, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents both a diagnostic and therapeutically problematic urological disease picture.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low, at 55-73% and 10-40% respectively.
We report microsurgical testicular denervation as an operative alternative in treatment-refractory testalgia.
12 patients were treated surgically after adequate environmental diagnosis by seminal cord neurolysis:
The M. cremastericus is cut by means of bipolar diathermia, the adventitia of the testicularis artery is detached under microsurgical conditions on a course length of 2-3 cm.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11 / 12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications have not been observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical seminal strand neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our operative procedure can only be maintained with the exact indication position, so that a precise environmental diagnosis to exclude a specific genesis of the test algia is indispensable.
In neurosurgery, too, there is a trend towards less and less invasive surgical techniques to avoid large trepanations, to minimize the preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves, and thus to minimise the risk of neurological and psychological disorders.
Hospitalization and incapacity for work can be shortened so often.
The essential "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, brain chambers and subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is closure hydrocephalus.
But also arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular space demands can be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. Cavernous, to be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used in a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the paper was to measure diffusion coefficient (ADC) by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral metastases and MR morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
The DW-MRI measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e. Diffusion barriers) is a lower, in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is expected.
A 53-year-old man was found with a melanotic lung tumor that had completely closed the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the Bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lungs occurred.
Due to the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as malignant melanoma.
There was no history of prior removal of skin, mucosal or eye changes.
The targeted examinations of the skin and the eye also revealed no evidence of a primary tumor localized there.
Thus, the new formation is to be regarded as primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered to have been confirmed so far.
The patient is tumour-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far there is no experience about the twilight vision according to LASIK.
We therefore studied twilight vision before and after LASIK for correcting myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for noninvasive ischemia diagnosis.
Ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging can be used to perform identical pharmacological stress protocols as currently applied in echocardiography.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost as part of an organ culture storage.
This paper investigated whether this was down regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or loss of HLA - DR positive corneal Langerhans cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has developed into a routine diagnostic technique, preferably used in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
The static cytometry (microscopic cytometrics) is inferior to the flow cytometer for reasons of the lower expressiveness.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodically flawless technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, in 1. Line the S phase and the proliferation index, in 2. Line also the ploidy, represent prognostic and important factors for therapy planning.
A detailed knowledge of the method and the possible errors is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for the determination of proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be considered as unclear at this stage.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric studies and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
In cervical syndromes, injection therapy has significant significance.
This paper deals with both general conditions and the various practical procedures for injection.
Summary The coverage of postal exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear, but the question of coverage by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical benefits (§ 23 SGB V.) and health examinations (§ 25 SGB IV) will not be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
Pep is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the standard financing of health insurance, as corresponding recommendations of the federal committees are missing.
It would be desirable for appropriate recommendations to be adopted soon in order to remove legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, a cost assumption obligation according to the principles of the legal character of the so-called new examination and treatment methods may be considered.
In itself, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP have to be specified in terms of indication and method of application and freed from ambiguities.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, because from a scientific point of view there are still too many ambiguities.
HLA - DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage results in loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present paper investigates the importance of extended corneal storage time for the success of perforating keratoplasty.
Based on own experiences with 3-dimensional echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct 3-dimensionally ultrasonographic transfontanal studies and to investigate their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients systemically treated with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report about a 37-year-old patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation, had heterotopic ossifications on 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for intensive therapy was a double transplantation in severe pulmonary hypertension.
By resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints, a restoration of mobility could be achieved.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatic, after spinal cord injury, after SHT, in intoxication and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is unknown until now, a transformation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then condition the bone formation.
The diagnosis is made with the aid of imaging techniques.
Prophylactic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), irradiation or a combination of both can be performed.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), in which we used the argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that were not or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After application of the argon laser, complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vessel-mediated effects of argon laser are relevant for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
As part of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Overall, complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only lifesaving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Hepatitis C reinfection occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favourable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis in hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for the graft is less favourable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study as well as the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumours consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception are rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in preexcitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative claim.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromes or antidrome reentrytachycardia of different incidence, duration and frequency.
The understanding of tachycardia mechanism and the role of the accessory pathway in tachicardia, the identification of its topography, the function of the other structures of the arousal conduction system and the detection of further paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident diseases of the heart should be examined before the intervention by echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of the procedure with contrast presentation.
In 300 patients with accidental variants of preexcitation syndrome, own catheter ablation results are presented.
Standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary in order to achieve a better quality of coverage of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics for years.
The Heidelberg University Orthopaedic Hospital Foundation has maintained a complete consensus register of all early complications of all inpatient patients since 1.1.1997.
According to a standardized nomenclature, complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program and the information is checked, corrected, supplemented and classified by the department of quality management of the clinic.
The guide is intended to contribute to the discussion of a standard in the detection and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the aim of building consensus.
Acrobular PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the area of the acres at the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiology is likely to be based on an obligatory impairment of dermoepidermal coherence during treatment, which is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of bulging blisters.
Acrobular photodermatosis should be distinguished from phototoxic reactions occurring as a result of excessive UVA irradiation or excessive psoral concentrations.
On the basis of two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this disease picture is presented.
In addition to autoptically confirmed findings of a fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological characteristics, which have been classified into main and secondary criteria.
On the basis of the following examination in a collective of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of an ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the established criteria is to be verified.
Global or segmental dilations of the right ventricle in terms of main criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography, or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) had only minor criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium was discovered histologically.
T-inversions in right-precordial derivatives as secondary criteria were available in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS expansion of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as main criteria.
A late potential analysis by means of signalling ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of secondary criteria.
Left-leg block-like chamber tachycardia, classified as minor criteria, was detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died without proven arrhythmias of progressive right heart failure.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion was observed in 3 out of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of an ARVD led to the diagnostics of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a reliable histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without adding histological data, clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favourable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more possible.
Clear data show that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the effect of acute hyperglycaemia in cerebral ischemia is assessed controversially.
The contradictory results of the clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained if different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood sugar levels during the acuteevent is taken into account.
Hyperglycaemia appears to magnify the neural damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia in the event of an inefficient collateral supply.
Furthermore, the risk of haemorrhagic transformation during this period is increased.
In contrast, an acute blood sugar increase by improving substrate supply can protect nerve tissue from structural damage if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is in the area of penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that both the negative and the positive effects of acute hyperglycaemia depend on the local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgical diagnosis, according to which 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacokinetic focal epilepsy underwent a resective epilepsy surgery.
The localisational agreement of findings of non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), interictal positron emission (PET) tomography and ictal SPECT (single photon emission computer tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78% (n = 39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or very rarely had seizures.
Extra-temporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and resections were performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that non-invasive EEG derivations are sufficient in pre-surgical diagnostics in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, in particular temporal epilepsies, and thus the risk of invasive EEC examinations can be avoided.
Medical history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented himself in a foreign clinic with a new tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiographically, the suspicion of an intracardial space requirement was first expressed, which should be further clarified by means of transesophageal ecocardiography.
A tachyarrhythmia absoluta with frequencies up to 146 / min was found in the Ekg, and a sinus rhythm was also documented intermittently.
This was also confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large space requirement in projection to the rear mediastinum, the right mediastinal rim laterally superior.
Due to the repressive growth of the cyst with induction of atrial rhythm disorders and to the safe exclusion of malignant degeneration, the cyte was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in the sinus rhythm and complains only about isolated "dropouts" most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primary harmless atrial arrhythmia disorders may also be due to rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intracardial space requirements, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracal cysts is given.
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can have a variety of causes.
Rare trigger of a paresis of one or multiple brain nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
Early detection of carotid dissection even with atypical symptoms is important because anticoagulant therapy initiated in time can prevent stroke as a result of dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder syndrome) and caudal cranionic nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal brain nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle brain nerves (VI-VIII) have been described, so that any painful sudden brain nerve loss must also be thought of as a carotid dissection.
The miscarriage of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary abnormalities, often remains asymptomatic into old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as on the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis came about by chance in the context of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of replanting the coronary artery aberration without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The application of modern, minimally invasive surgery methods in the care of joint-near fractures offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result through low, surgically induced soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least a training stability, even in comparison with the standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the low operative soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative assessment of the joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular accompanying injuries through arthroscopy are of particular advantage compared to conventional methods.
Out of a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures, arthroscopic osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients in our clinic between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed good overall results after the Lysholm and Delamarter score.
For a selected patient, we consider arthroscopically supported minimally invasive osteosynthesis also suitable for fractures of the AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report a 72-year-old patient who experienced bilateral hypoglossusparesis without other neurological deficits after moderate craniocerebral trauma, which clinically resolved completely within 3 months.
Since no cranial base fracture could be detected by computertomography in the area of the posterior cranium pit, we discuss a bilateral deformation of the hypoglossus nerve as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency is a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backlog propagates from the large conductive veins to the smallest venoles to the area of microcirculation, eventually affecting tissue metabolism.
Typical clinical features best serve as the basis for classification principles, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement procedure.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the soil of arteriovenous short-circuit compounds.
In the area of the lower extremities usually unilateral skin changes occur, which are reminiscent of a Kaposi sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and rarely hypertrophy of the affected limb.
The disease is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerating nodules with a tendency to bleed and infection.
The causal therapy is the elimination of the arteriovenous shunts.
Surgery is rarely possible because of the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
Successful embolization treatment, which has been performed 8 times to date, is reported in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart Bluefarb syndrome.
So far, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytosis of the skin was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granula) and immunohistology at the freezing section (CD1a) in addition to the clinic and the histology of the H & E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-related markers now also allow formalin-fixed material to be processed (also retrospectively) and precisely classified of these diseases.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classical cells of Langerhanszell histiocytosis (LZH) can be separated from other histocytic cell systems.
The so-called non-Langerhanszell histiocytoses (non-LZH) did not have uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics until now.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes / macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes / macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-related immunohistological markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Diagnostic value regarding the delimitation from the Langerhanszell histiocytosis appears to have antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown by the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown on juvenile xanthogranuloma).
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epithelioid cells typical of the disease.
In the following we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of application of allopurinol as well as after reexposure of this drug.
Urinary bladder verrucous carcinoma (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with dog ulcer for 10 years.
So far, 7 case reports of urinary bladder verrucous carcinoma not associated with schistosomiasis have been published in world literature.
Although the development of urinary bladder verrucous carcinoma as a complication of IC has not been described so far, the pathomechanism of development of verruckose carcinoma appears to lie in the chronic irritation of the bladder.
After exhausting the conservative therapy possibilities, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary derivation took place.
"NOTOX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin / formaldehyde for fixation of tissue samples for histological examination.
Intraoperative tissue and autoptically obtained organ samples were used to test NOTOX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistologic staining, especially for tumor diagnosis, were employed.
As a result of these studies, which were carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NOTOX do not differ from formalin-fixed tissue samples in terms of the reproducibility of conventional staining or the visualisation of immunohistochemical reactions.
NOTOX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
Dose levels such as the Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDI), the Multiple Scan Average Dose (MSAD) and the Axis Dose Free in Air are commonly used to describe the patient's exposure to radiation in computed tomography.
The CTDI and the MSAD derived from it are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose that allows an estimate of the risk.
The indication of an upper guideline for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirements of the study region in order to ensure an acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 sizes are useful for characterizing and differentiating different study programs and equipment with respect to radiation exposure.
According to a report of the World Heart Federation / International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF / ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was extended in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been newly included in this definition.
Consequently, a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenovirus, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and dilation of the ventricles.
It seems sensible to assign shame an independent place as a general human emotion in distinction from guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self" -preserving function of shame should be considered.
The appearance of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of value, even if it should not currently be recognizable in the patient.
The signal character of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have disease value is considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shamdynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very heterogeneous in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as professional competence.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disturbance and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory reaction as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune systems in their pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammation cells and lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
Postulated is increased programmed cell death (apoptosis).
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angine (group 2) were evaluated immunohistochemically (TUNEL test for the detection of fragmented DNA) and by electron microscopy.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to delineate apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on special fixed corpses - according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - the relationship between the position of the transversalis fascia and the balloon was investigated and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In the case of TEP, the fascia can be used laterally of the artery as reinforcement of the rear wall of the groin canal or as abutment for fixing foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin changes.
The detection of numerous mites in the dandruff crust resulted in the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
An underlying disease could be excluded in both cases.
It is suspected that the treatment of the eczema for months in the sense of immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The efficacy of haemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and in particular effective O2 delivery to tissues has been demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme haemodilution and haemorrhagic shock.
The haemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approx. 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
A certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the remaining side effect of the haemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative of the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of the artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured people.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, in which it is either the only causal-acting, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapy component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, special consideration should be given to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication position, and the ability and skills to safely master emerging complications with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapy character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anaesthetist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues in terms of oncological therapy.
In this paper, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound, because of its good depth focusability, could be used as an additional therapeutic technique in tumours that are accessible by sound technology.
The experimentally observed ultrasonic induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasonic parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "on-line" monitoring of ultrasonic induced high temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumours be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
In a group of extremely small preterm infants, the long-term effects of preterm birth on ocular and ENT medical status should be demonstrated.
At the orthopedic University Hospital Homburg / Saar, an EDP system has been used since 1993 for operating room and ambulance documentation as well as to support the general hospital organization.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS- or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the system has included data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 surgeries.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through a further, clinic-wide network, the University Hospital Homburg also has the opportunity to exchange data across departments and to use scientific networks as well as the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre-and post-operative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to examine whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupil reaction.
It also points to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with current compensation practices.
In this study in sheep, it should be clarified whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulphated and non-sulphated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether there is a temporal assignment and whether the results indicate a halt to the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or, alternatively, whether Arthrosemarker.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals:
The controls are the knee joints on the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological score between groups TD vs. Me and MV are statistically significant (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, the HA shows a significantly increased value in the ME and MV groups.
The CS results in significantly increased levels (p < 0.01) for both the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial separation.
Clinical Consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - possible, to some extent a description of the degree of arthrosis.
Concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome may present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures.
Treatment with -blockers is considered standard of care for symptomatic patients.
In the event of therapy failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic block may be considered as an option.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95 / 12 year old patient.
Supplements and use of an epidiascope are described, which after minor modifications for the presentation of organ or Organ discs suitable in the courses of general and special pathology and saves expensive video installations with additional lighting etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older age and of far-reaching significance.
These problems are here related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego ideal in old age.
In three aspects, pathological exacerbations of the aging process, which are often present in older patients, are shown.
Then it describes narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients and discusses ways and objectives in the treatment of elderly patients.
Treatment results of muscle energy technique after Mitchel for spinal problems are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a great success.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chirotherapeutic techniques with impulse.
We report about a 26-year-old patient with a Dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, which complains of arthritic knee joint problems, relapsing diarrhoea and a sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjogren syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different diseases has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in the clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological diseases.
In developed countries, it is medical conditions rather than food shortages that contribute to malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the older population and occurs in 5-12% of the elderly living independently, in 30-61% of hospitalised and in 40-85% of elderly people living in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial character of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A doctor's awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important in evaluating potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
From the optical microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 Junktions- / Compoundnävi statistically significant differences were found for 12 structural features.
Digitiform radial foothills, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown / black dots in front of blue / gray background, pseudopodia-like border zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific incident light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several single features suspected of malignancy occurring in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy procedures in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently related vectorial transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Initial clinical applicability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) has been transmitted are a significant step forward in the clinical gene therapy of osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic mandibular.
We report on our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral applications in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromal disease.
These included 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with one-sided hypoplasia of the lower jaw with Goldenhar syndrome and 1 infant with rodent syndrome, as well as 1 rare case of a midline defect with 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm.
Older people who are interested in continuing education are increasingly aware of the many opportunities offered by the Internet in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further education institutions and institutions for the education of the elderly are called upon to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media competence and to design virtual learning opportunities of interest to them.
On the basis of experience from the "Senior Info Mobile" information campaign, ways to facilitate access to new communication technologies for people over 50 are described.
Using the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects as examples, it is further demonstrated how spatially and temporally decoupled, research-based learning of older adults could become the engine of a "new learning culture," in the sense of virtual working groups and networks, which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who, for health and other personal reasons, cannot participate in local offers.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnosis, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by noninvasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography has additionally opened up the possibility of new functional examination procedures in recent years.
The MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of simultaneous detection of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Because of the high spatial resolution and reproducibility, Cine MRI is the gold standard for function analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, there is now the possibility of clarifying many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic method that offers the complete diagnosis of heart diseases in a single examination, both as an initial examination and as a follow-up.
Due to the rapidly progressing development, still existing restrictions, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and IT at the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is given.
Since its foundation in 1967, four phases of development can be distinguished:
Initial medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, implementation of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of performance.
Planning and implementation were carried out in compliance with the framework plans and concepts of the University Hospitals of the State of Baden-Württemberg.
We report the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac pressure massage.
It is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation into iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyem and formation of infected aneurysm spurium.
The cause must be assumed to be contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment consisted of resection of inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The Problem Six-year-old boy with Type II unilateral cleavage foot with oligodactylie and second toe clinodactyly.
This review article examines the current status of the controversy over the indication for the backplane replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in experimental and biomechanical fields is described as well as structural features of the different implant types and peculiarities of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar backplane replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it discusses why the indication for backplane replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication position for the replacement of patellar backplane could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes of the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint prostheses are still unclear so far.
In particular, chronic mechanical overloading of the boundary layers due to changes in stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be excluded.
Arterial hypertension is commonly observed after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensive drugs cyclosporine A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
So far, there has been little research on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" denotes the absence of visible fracture signs in the conventional radiography performed for the initial diagnosis with still existing fracture.
The diagnosis is only possible in the course of or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations carried out for this purpose have only a moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a method that allows early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" as well as the diagnosis of possible chondral and ligamentous concurrent injuries.
In the present study, we report on 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, where the diagnosis with negative X-ray results could be made with the MRI.
The athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon described early on.
Histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the very variable clinical picture and the diagnosis to be confirmed only invasive or post-mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications in surgical procedures or catheterization of the aortic.
Anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with pedicled and movable thrombi originating from circumscribed plaques.
Embolic recurrence could be prevented and regression of thrombi could be observed.
A 62-year-old patient with pronounced valgus malposition and right knee joint elongation inhibition as a result of a supracondylar femoral debris fracture is reported to have been treated osteosynthetically by dynamic condylar screw 2 years ago.
Here the indication to a varying and extending correction osteotomy and osteosynthesis by means of retrograde femoral nail was presented.
The patient was able to fully strain the lower right limb within the first postoperative week with successful axle compensation.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method to achieve good and stress-stable osteosynthesis even in corrective surgery.
Lacrimal surgery at the University Eye Hospital Münster of 296 children from the years 1987 - 1992 were examined.
Histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophile mucus formation) are always suspect, but even not proving for a carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (core size, hyperchromasia, nucleoles, cytoplasm changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must in any case be critically assessed and can at best confirm or safely exclude a cancer diagnosis (with positive detection of basal cells).
In the present review, the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 14active 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 IV was compared with a monthly dose of 50mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an inital dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, despite further administration of the test substance, there was an increase in inflammatory parameters.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis is reported.
The combination of clotting disorder and spleen tumor already suggested the suspicion of vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care, so that any disorder of postnatal adaptation is detected in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation of gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used for many years in sports and rehabilitation, in which deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt), jogging - similar movements are carried out.
In sports, aquajogging is used as regeneration training and as "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance.
In rehabilitation, aquajogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for diseases of the musculoskeletal system and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are of a vascular or prosthetic nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy in a selected patient.
The most important criteria are age below 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to approx. 53-55%, contrary to initial short-term successes.
Venous surgery has lost its place due to a drastic reduction in long-term success (below 40% on average).
Penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term survival rates of the implants and 89% patient satisfaction.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapy option to the last place of the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations can occur with 5-year survival rates of the implants between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal transplants, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our now 3 years experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is relatively commonly used for bladder instillation and significantly reduces the frequency of nocturia, while the micturition frequnz remained unchanged during the day in a controlled study.
Heparin also lowered the frequency of nocturia in an open - ended prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are virtually non-side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, and this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of radiological information web sites have sprung up and are now available online, with competition emerging with commercial offerings.
According to initial experience, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes belong to the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
In the following we report from a psychiatric and legal medical point of view about 2 cases in which the mothers responded to SID with exceptionally severe depression and accused themselves of killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations are made for the care of affected parents.
The review of the cases of 110 children admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, with Burkitt lymphoma within a 7-year period showed obesity of male versus female patients (1.9:
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that in the aetiology of the tumor an interrelationship between infections caused by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses and malnutrition could play a role.
The most important drug is cyclophosphamide.
Combining this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in initiating the regression of the disease, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.
Follow-up examinations of the patients revealed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has formed a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
The Zwickau surgery provided important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization, as well as for surgical teaching in word and image.
After a brief review of the literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania, which have so far been little described in an adolescent patient, are to be presented.
Against the background of early abandonment fears, within the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness, there is a renewed threat of being dropped.
The symptom that previously served the regulation of diffuse internal tensions and fears can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%.
The skin changes, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, may cause pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis following administration of a falsely 50-fold high-concentration dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovaskul ‰ ren Hypertonie is of particular importance because it is successfully treatable as a secondary form of hypertonia by interventional radiological or gef ‰ ﬂsurgical measures in many cases and partly also curable.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications following LASIK should be investigated.
An andrological patient is reported in whom the initial examination revealed high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicular size significantly below the normal range spoke for a pronounced testis parenchyma damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear may be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline followed by a 3-month recovery period with a combination treatment with vitamins C and E and the trace element zinc, there was a significant improvement in spermiogram.
After a further 2 months, intrauterine insemination enabled pregnancy to be achieved with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At this time, the patient only had mild teratozoospermia.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anaesthesia procedures.
Changes in retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy in systemic therapy with corticosteroids should be described.
The x-ray of the pelvic overview also has its indication today in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in toddler age in addition to sonography.
The toddler's legs shall be held in centre position.
Lateral rotation and increased pelvic inclination should be avoided.
A review of 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which in the "open approach" with the tip of the nose recently developed back into the 19th century. Century took.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
Sublabial access to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest X-ray image comes first.
Profound knowledge of the normal thoracic image and the possible physiological peripartum changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of neonatological chest imaging.
Childhood Pathologies:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes that the radiologist is confronted with in neonatology are unknown in the radio diagnosis of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening to the patient or can affect the quality of life in his or her further life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the most important pathologies that the radiologist can face in daily routine.
The primary tumours were mammacarcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcomas (N = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (N= 16), hypernephroid carcinoma (N- 13), melanoma (N - 9), gastric carcinoma (NS-), bronchial and adrenal cancers (NN = 6 each) and 14 other tumours.
Extrahepatic tumor infestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 out of 140 (49%) cases and in 51% (n = 61) of the 120 first resections an extraheptatic tumor was present.
Of the 120 first resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) R2 resections.
Median overall survival was 20 months after first resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months following R1 / 2 resections.
After second resection (n = 14), median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumour at the time of first liver resection, median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1 / 2 resection.
The available results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences can even benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term trends have been observed even in a rather unfavourable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for operative therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed at the non-personal act for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in prison, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communal artery.
For the assessment of guilt, this course of action, in connection with the alleged behavioral problems shortly before the act, therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be taken into account.
This may have been an epileptic twilight condition as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proved its worth for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated into the vitreous.
Due to the high specific weight of PFCL, the IOL is flushed up and can be replicated into the anterior segment of the eye, where it e.g. Can be refixed in the sulcus ciliaris.
What kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Since biotoxicity of PFCL is likely with prolonged intraocular retention, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of the operation.
A rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma is reported.
Metastasis occurred after seven years of apparent - free postoperative interval.
No clinically observable metastases were found during further investigations.
Nevertheless, taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental anomalies of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreatic anular) of the two plants.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas anulare can ultimately only be secured by a gait representation of the pancreatic duct.
In congenital diseases there are genetic defects, in which mostly other organ systems are involved and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually in the foreground of the disease.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected with modern imaging techniques.
Books often do not just contain the material written by the author.
On the basis of the panel work by Bärensprung and Hebra, it is explained that at second glance, they also reveal some other medically historically relevant facts.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia / defect are asymptomatic at birth and diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presented congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel breast and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The significance of ultrasonography in bacterial coxitis was reviewed.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), Coxitis fugax (N = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (N + 12), Perthes' disease (n + 92) and Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (N − 21) have been sonographically evaluated.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the hip head surface and the periarticular structures can be assessed at the standard section levels of the DEGUM.
An intraarticular space requirement (synovialitis, effusion) can be recorded sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsular detachment has been sonographically detected in bacterial coxitis, Coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis, and in the early stage of Perthes' disease.
Since there are no significant differences in joint capsule distension among the individual diseases, sonogram does not allow differentiation of these diseases when capsular distensions are present without bony changes.
Bacterial coxitis cannot therefore be reliably distinguished from coxitides of other genesis sonographically;
Capsule distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
In case of clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, immediate diagnostic puncture may be required under sonographic control.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to the capsule distension, the epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and the disease Perthes in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be sonographically distinguished from both the bacterial coxitis and coxitids of other genesis.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in summary of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Due to the presence of unusually highly differentiated tumor cells for gliomatosis cerebri in both cases, the diagnosis was complicated by atypical findings such as contrast uptake in MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomized clinical study are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized studies are discussed in detail and presented as being the only way to reach conclusions about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but that in this sense good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
A possible influence on anticoagulant therapy by tricyclic antidepressants has been evaluated differently so far.
Above all, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost ignored in investigations.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclic drugs.
Summary From 1 April 1996 to 30 June 1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerotic-related, symptomatic infrared aortic stenosis were treated with transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneous in one case a thrombal arterectomy of the external iliaca artery with profundaplasty was performed, in another case an angioplasty with stent implantation of the community iliac artery was performed.
The technical as well as clinical success was given in all cases.
No occlusion or clinical restenosis occurred during a median observation period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation in segmental abdominal aortic stenosis represents a little invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary A patient is reported to have undergone several years of sterility treatment and become pregnant, even though she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous as pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has been classified as more apathogenic to humans in the past.
The case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus has been culturally detected in tracheal secretion following aortocoronal bypass surgery in the intensive care unit is described.
The performed serological test procedures, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
Is "monoclonal antibody" correct or with monoclonic antibodies?) Monoclonal antibodies covered latex particles, were multiple negative.
A postmortem aspergillus testing with a newer method, the antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiological findings.
The patient died before using antifungal therapy, the autopsy showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
Due to the correct assessment of the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even with a single cultural detection of Aspargillusflavus in the trachea.
Epidemiological data show a decline in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in the industrialized countries.
The age peak is 10-19, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high perforation rate in young children and old people shows the low diagnostic safety.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not permit a clear conclusion to be drawn as to the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After refractive surgery on the cornea and after cataract surgery ocular image errors (aberrations) may occur, which cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason that the maximum retinal visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image errors under clinical conditions would be a first important step in the documentation and correction of these aberrations by means of modern photorefractive procedures.
Until now, only static unidirectional tensile stress tests had been carried out experimentally for both methods.
Ecke and Hofmann came to the conclusion that with flexible fixations a comparable stability against rigid procedures could be achieved and that this was to be preferred because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis for prophylaxis their ankylosierung.
Symphysis stabilization by means of DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension belts and PDS bandings were comparatively tested by simultaneous multi-directional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in sagittal and vertical directions with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire tension belt nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, and these procedures allowed symphysis mobility beyond physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, the instability was generally increased by cutting the cerclagen and bandings into the bone or breaking the wire cerclages until complete failure.
In the DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
With primary overturning inclination of the screws, the plate stabilization under dynamic loading became more and more unstable.
With primarily stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55 500 load changes with a load corresponding to the average half body weight.
For clinical use, it can be deduced from these results that neither the bridging tension belt with wire cerclagen nor the PDS banding sufficiently stabilize the ruptured symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If a reliable stabilization of the ruptured symphysis can be achieved primarily with the DC plate or the reconstruction plate by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with "open-book injury" can be mobilized with partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted with good success for years.
Due to the light distribution to several focal points, a lower amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects caused by capsule fibrosis may lead to early visual impairment.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm tall, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumor was initially misunderstood as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
A 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was only discovered in the course of an anaemia assessment 17 months later and resected by means of Duodenopankreatectomy.
Reassessment of primary histology led to revision of initial diagnosis and classification of thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later of an apoplectic cult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of tumor disease as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local application of pharmaceuticals.
The only approved oral substance with proven effectiveness at this time is yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha-receptor blocker.
Other oral medications with a central point of attack include trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine acting significantly better than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical studies.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous methods of administration are available for local application.
At this stage, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely displaced other pharmaceuticals as the substance used.
At present, several promising substances with different active approaches and different dosage forms are under development as a therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the state of consciousness of the patient, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is especially important for severely disturbed patients who are not sufficiently accessible by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies summarized under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients have a time-limited stabilisation of the disease, which in individual cases lasts for years.
Most of these are results from uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival benefit for immunotherapeutic patients over non- or chemotherapists.
A survival benefit for patients with objective remissions is assured.
Standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of current treatment protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates and the survival benefit reported by some authors for immunotherapeutic patients [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
As a general rule, use should be made in clinical trials.
Laboratory indices are calculated from the measurements of 12 clinical chemistry parameters in 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half 44.4 + / - 0.9 and 63.0 + / -0.9 years old each) and 239 women (half 44,4 + / − 0,9 and 62,8 + / = 0.8 years old respectively) and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
The calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL-cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between the laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also significantly correlate with preaging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL / HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered by chance in a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial carcinoma in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analog tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the epiploicae appendices and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypias in the peritone rinsing fluid.
These findings are likely to be due to occult peritoneal endosal pingioses.
The histogenesis, histology and localization of primary peritoneal neoplasia of Müller type are discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft, it was hoped that this procedure would initially have advantages in terms of stability, post-operative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopic and 14 open-surgery patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The score systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligamentous stability (KT-1000), the duration of surgery and proprioception were measured by the angle reproduction test.
The energy dose of spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area by means of thermoluminescence dosemeters and a phantom head.
The tube power for dental CT recommended by the manufacturer of the computed tomograph has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGi (skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm scanning distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGY (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average measurement uncertainty was 0,1-0,3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by approximately 76% had no effect on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average a factor of 10 higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, allows a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathies and idiopathic dilatory cardiomyopathic cardiopathy (no evidence of inflammatory alterations in the Myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected with histological and above all immunohistological techniques.
It was only through the combination of histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques that a subgroup analysis was possible with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiac myopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic / postoperative), bacterial endogenous (haematogenic) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of bacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitids can be distinguished, which, unlike the others, is preferentially manifested on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with claviculaosteomyelitis we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as casuistics.
Differential diagnosis must take into account the primary chronic-sclerotic osteomyelitis of the clavicula despite its rare occurrence, as it is - after bioptic diagnosis - a domain of conservative, medicinal therapy.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The paper uses literature analysis to explore the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in optimizing chemotherapeutic protocols using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses and, above all, well-designed clinical studies can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.
In this paper, the in vitro and in vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous ballon and double balloon), the double balloon was favoured for in vivo application.
On the basis of staining of the cytoskeleton and electronoptically, the paclitaxel effect was detected in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel resulted in significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and vascular diameter dilation compared with balloon dilated control animals.
In addition experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contraction force after paclitaxel administration has been demonstrated.
In addition to the age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplasm and basal membranes of RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), various manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularization and pigment epithelial removals reveal a splitting of the Bruch membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cell and the inner collagen layer.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether age-dependent regression of adhesion apparatus is detectable.
Recent studies show that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis occur as a result of disturbed spinal growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the location of the lesion and the type of vision effect, in order to enable early operative therapy with maintenance of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of frequent dermatoses, suitable animal models found in nature are missing.
The transgenic technology established in the 1980s fills this gap.
It was initially an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but has also made its way into clinical-oriented specifically dermatological basic research over the past five years.
It made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses on the murine model and gain insights into their pathogenesis.
By targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice had similarities with psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, such mice can be used to study the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumours.
The existence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows the targeted research of experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in carriers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic questions such as processes in the posterior cranial pit, spinal abscesses and internal knee complaints can be better examined by MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect carriers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) warming and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in carriers of artificial heart valves does not seem sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of the MRI of their respective valve prostheses.
Some companies based their statements on unobservable examinations, or transferred responsibility to the doctor who carries out the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI on certain types of prostheses.
Building on our survey, it provides an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and requirements for MRI safety standards in carriers of artificial heart valves.
In an experimental study, an intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml gas was performed in 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml bolus doses, respectively.
Another animal was successfully reanimated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5) neither one of the animals died nor a resuscitation was necessary.
Low soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma anulare with known diabetic metabolic location.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoral full-body baths using the foil method, which resulted in complete regression of lesions on the trunk and neck after 30 treatments and a marked improvement in skin findings on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes can be therapeutically influenced by balneophotochemotherapy.
The cat scratch disease (KKK) is a little-known infectious disease in Germany.
Only a few years ago, the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less frequently, there are further organ manifestations.
We report a 47-year-old patient who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbalgia after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint participation in a KKK have been described.
However, because the disease of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, it could be a more common cause of joint discomfort than previously thought.
The diagnosis of the KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Continuous therapy optimization in recent years has significantly improved the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a variety of possible long-term complications, which the attending physician must be aware of.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism as well as damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the mostly young patients are permanently impaired in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia following primarily successful therapy is a significant problem.
Starting from attachment styles as described patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the aim was to make these patterns appropriate in the sense of their original definition, i.e. to operationalise them as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "safe," "avoiding" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
On the basis of factor analytical results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as bonding styles:
"Safe," two variants of "insecure-ambivalent" ("locked" and "clinging") and two variants "unsafe-avoiding" (the "closed" and the "cooperative").
Discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions similar to those of Collins u. Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of clinical signs of progressive inner ear deafness, vertigo and concomitant radiological evidence of contrast-absorbing space requirements of the internal auditory canal reinforce the suspicion of the presence in the auditory neuroma.
We report a 57-year-old patient with a history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case study shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellar bridge angle, which manifested itself with a peripheral brain nerve loss in the ENT area and initially lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of only peripheral brain nerves preoperatively suggested the presence of lymphoma.
The facial paresis occurring within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia with radiance in the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings, as in the case described by us, must challenge, despite the present leading symptoms, to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellar bridge angle is considered a rarity.
Balneotherapy and physiotherapy are available to the gynaecologist in practice, clinic and rehabilitation as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynaecology, balneogynaecology, as a natural healing method, has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
Balneogynaecological and physiotherapeutic measures should be used primarily as complementary measures in relation to indications.
Only in chronic conditions as well as acute muscular tension, they are particularly suitable for pain reduction and positive tissue influence as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently take an average of four weeks to achieve a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent sensitivity testing.
It takes seven to eight weeks to report a negative cultural result.
Faster results are achieved with individual diagnostic steps through new procedures such as Nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The world-wide worrying epidemiological situation of the risk of infection of tuberculosis leaves no doubt that there is a need for further development of methods allowing, in the shortest possible time, the detection, differentiation and testing of mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity to antibiotics.
As part of a prospective randomized study, a non-joint bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the treatment of the distal radius fracture (A2 / A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the supply of gypsum by percutaneous cherry-wire osteosynthesis.
The collection of donated women's milk has a long tradition in Germany.
Modern screening methods exclude transmission of infections.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favourable composition, for very immature premature babies, the milk is preferred by donors who have too early-born children themselves.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day care centers (TSN) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care facilities.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the widespread lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and the way they work.
In this work, 100 visitors from TSN and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, the psychopathological symptomatic and the view of the visitors were raised.
Almost all visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with moderate degree of expression.
Two-thirds of the visitors were boarded, most of them living alone and having little or no friends.
Among the positive aspects of the facilities, visitors mentioned contact with other people and the day-to-day structure.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
Visitors to TSN were on average younger and had higher levels of energy in the BPRS subscale.
In addition, visitors to the two institutions hardly differed in the characteristics examined.
The results suggest that both institutions actually provide chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration, for which they are also designed.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomgraphy (SPECT).
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast media applications and special post-processing methods made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1 and T2 * -weighted contrast-mediated imaging sequences may provide information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation, and permeability of the blood-brain barrier using special, e.g. T. nuclear medicine models.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be represented with diffusion-weighted MRI, the marrovasculature, dissolved in time, with MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic studies, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissues can be recorded in a multidimensional manner and metabolic processes can be observed in the course of the process.
Advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of three-dimensional presentation of the data and any repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of value compared with nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, the functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy identification, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial investigations have shown that the methods are capable of sensitively detecting pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared aim of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to place health protection in the awareness of all in the countries of the European region, also in view of the constant political and economic changes.
Environmental factors that affect health should be combated internationally by concrete measures or better avoided preventively.
An essential prerequisite is an understanding of international standards in the field of environment and health, as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It is important to ensure that governments and the relevant population develop a common perception of the important environmental health issues.
In order to ensure the smooth flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts necessary for this purpose, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO / EURO), with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn, established a "WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health" at the Robert Koch Institute in summer 1997.
A 30-year-old patient is reported to have experienced right-sided amaurosis fugax with concomitant frontobasal fracture following a fall event.
By CT and MR angiography, occlusion of the ophthalmic artery as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery with increasing thrombosis was demonstrated as a cause.
Further neurological deficits did not exist because adequate blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured via the arteriosus cerebri circuit.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amauroses such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically if necessary.
The suspicion of acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification with appropriate imaging techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, an asymptomatic patient had echocardiographic suspicions of an aortic dissection.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other sectional techniques to diagnose the evidence of skin irritation of the aneurysmatically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
One 54-year-old patient was hospitalised for acute chest pain, increased dyspnoea and with a picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In the further examination by echocardiography, a ruptured sinus valsalva aneurysm of the right-coronary sail with left-right shunt in the right atrium could be determined as a cause in a non-invasive way.
Cardiac surgery was performed without complications while maintaining the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right heart sections were normal, in the color Doppler no shunt was detectable.
Acute cardiac insufficiency may also be a consequence of congenital heart failure in middle age.
Echocardiography and, in particular, transesophageal echocardiography enabled a precise diagnosis to be made in a non-invasive way.
Features of rodent syndrome include mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
Mandibular hypoplasia can lead to respiratory obstruction due to concerns of the tongue at the back of the throat, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who received nose CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnoea.
After the soft tissues were prestretched by extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was already performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic result are good.
Respiratory obstruction and dyspnoea were not observed after completion of therapy.
Successful internal carotid artery thrombal artery (TEA) tomies lead to improved perfusion in the current area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a concrete disease case by means of modern telematics.
Practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in clinical everyday life is largely defined, it is currently unclear whether this independent medical service will be adequately rewarded.
The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of these lenses on vision.
There is no doubt nowadays that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be an immediate consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old patient who had been suffering from progressive effluvium in psoriasis flocks on the capillitium for years.
Histologically implanted strangular fibrosations instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis that occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair folliles and features of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for any other cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
The knowledge of this possible relationship is important in that consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus probably the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormone (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
The treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves several clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely to be caused by an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
The hypothesis is presented that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with the consequence of reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-harming behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classic neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled studies, serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone was also effective in reducing SVV in the longer term.
The purpose of the present study was to create an osteoporosis model by ovarectomy.
Before and after ovarectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed by DXA.
A marked decrease in bone density after ovarectomy was seen in both the upper and lower jaw.
10 patients with idiopathic non-traumatic knee joint hemarthros were arthroscopically cleared and treated.
The causes of the bleeding were manifold:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangioma and meniscus lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from arroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy yielded good results.
Toxic snake bite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by cross otters (Vipera berus).
The cross otter injects a poison from various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Cross-otter bites in children can be low in symptoms, but can also cause the most severe signs of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their environment can be displayed on a large scale.
The transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapist not present at the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. a tumor, under therapy, are thus significantly improved.
Viruses, in turn, have become more mobile because of increasing human travel speed and activity around the world.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies is receiving more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world in an increasingly short time.
Using four case studies, this paper explores the factors that can influence early or late in the initial diagnosis of dementia.
We have set the indication for surgery in all our cases.
The perforation site was primarily sewn over and rinsed and drained extensively.
In 2 cases, the suture site was additionally secured by fibrin adhesive or with an omentumplastic.
All patients survived and recovered with no immediate consequences.
On the basis of these own findings and after evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions seem to us justified:
If early-stage perforation is secured, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Even with delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a seam closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resectant procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
Wilms tumours are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently in children with horseshoe kidney.
Wilms tumours are mixed malignant tissue tumours that rarely have larger fat tissue-containing proportions.
We report about a 28-month-old girl with unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, who could have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous proportion with internal calcification according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different sectional image procedures are introduced.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlation in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare condition often misunderstood as malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included early in differential diagnostic considerations.
A 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history, bloody purulent expectoration and significant body weight reduction is reported to have been assigned to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
Only through a diagnostic detour could the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis be made.
This was caused by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of discomfort were rapidly regressive and ultimately led to the healing of the patient.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of the diagnosis in the differential diagnostic clarification of thoracic spatial requirements, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors as well as germ cell tumors.
In hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber's disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver represent a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient in whom the percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, the adjustable "banding" of the liver artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, expander prosthesis was applied around liver artery and adapted hepatic artery throttling was performed via implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The technique described thus represents an alternative to the ligature of the liver artery if the percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis in biopsies of benign diseases has been made in its own research in 20 years in 3%.
While the puerperal mastitis occurs in relation to the number of births in approximately 1% today, the different forms of nonpuerperalmastiti have come to the fore clinically as well as histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as concomitant phenomena, the majority of mastititis currently being diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small part is an expression of an infectious or specific disease caused by the pathogen, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastic with tumor-shaped fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without features of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and in cases of suspected excitation-related mastitis, bacterioscopic and microbiological tests should always be carried out on the fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in repellent or antibiotic-treated patients.
We report on 2 5 respectively. 14-year-old boys with Clostridium-difficile-related colitis without the aforementioned preconditions or a certain basic condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, extends the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the application of a corresponding protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both the daily screening of the respiratory function and attempts of spontaneous breathing are valuable aids, which should be included in a weaning protocol.
As soon as the condition and ability of spontaneous breathing is documented, extubation of the ventilated patients should be promoted, as sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of the respirated patients can be successfully extubed after a spontaneous breathing experiment.
Abnormative discontinuation of mechanical ventilation may be undertaken in patients who have not been successful in spontaneous ventilation attempts.
Two randomised studies show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the rate and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with lip-jaw-palate clefts is said to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and the results of the operation in 30 patients with unilateral LKG columns.
Open rhinoplasty was used to correct nasal deformity.
Soft tissue analysis of the nose was done by measuring standardized nasal raster photos and the lateral remote X-ray.
Deviations of nasal symmetry, nasal width and nasal wing replacement line from ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal and the corner between Columella and Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate airflow permeability.
The total flow (cm3 / s) was determined and the flow of the gap and non-gap side were compared.
The examinations were performed immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, significant correction of nasal symmetry and alignment of the nasal wing inclination are achieved.
Significant improvement of pointed nasofacial angle and low - standing nasal wing was not achieved.
Through the intervention, the total flow could be increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the split side and the non-split side could be achieved.
The examination methods used can objectify the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings and thus serve a quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual spinal therapy from the years 1989-1996 were investigated.
There are no properly performed prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with manipulative spinal treatment in the literature.
Because of the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably represent normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stage of the injury, however, the joint fluid is often missing, which is necessary for an exact demarcation of the injured ligaments.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, as intra-articular KM administration distends the joint space with improved distinctiveness of intra-Articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage assessment of osteochondritis dissecans, as in cases of unstable lesions, KM flushing of the dissecate can be presented more easily.
Finally, because of the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free joint bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
MR arthrography although invasive provides essential additional information in the investigation of post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the condition before the onset of the emergency.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated due to out-of-clinical cardiac arrest of cardiac genesis in rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of strain varicosis of the V. saphena magna and / or parva type.
Ascension can lead to a migration of the thrombus into the deep vein system via the mouths of the stem veins into the groin and knee throat or via insufficent Vv. perforantes, which threatens the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes the varicophlebitis of the stem veins without the involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and / or parva and the deep vein system.
In type IV, the thrombus transfascially migrates via insufficent Vv. perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicosis is only surgically restored after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes the crosectomy, exstipation of the stem vein via separate incisions, exhairesis of all varicose branches and ligature of insufficent Vv. perforantes.
In type III, thrombectomy via the V-saphena magna and / or parva mouth has priority over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral finger areas and occurs almost only in young men.
Formalpathogenetic, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
On the basis of own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of coercive acts appear to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia (thrombotic thrombocytopenic pura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) is often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms include irritation, restlessness, confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological failures.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS / TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed acute hirnorgan psychosyndrome with progressive consciousness disorder to coma.
The initial cranial computed tomography showed a discrete, general brain swelling, which resolved regardless of the clinical deterioration.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
In transcranial Doppler sonography, generalized flow velocity increases were found (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides, and A. basilaris).
The causal relationship between flow velocity increases and consciousness disturbances is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of the flow rate increases.
Pathophysiologically, disturbed prostacycline metabolism, increase of serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow - up control of anterior cruciate ligament injury confirms the correctness of patient - adapted procedure.
Although the gold standard for the supply of cruciate ligament injury is the substitute plastic, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent possibility in adolescents.
We report the rare case of posttraumatic aneurysm of truncus brachiocephalicus.
This was preceded by blunt chest trauma as part of a traffic accident.
Computed tomography (CT) failed to diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography to exclude life-threatening vascular injury must be required as far as possible.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorised in terms of their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and in some cases differ considerably from them.
This short presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with sound decision support for his own practical work with regard to many everyday, but by no means incidental, problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent 21-day prolonged treatment with iloprost.
The dose was 2 ng / kgKGxmin over a 6-day creep period.
The therapy resulted in improvement of inflammatory parameters, lung function, especially diffusion capacity and pronounced acral circulatory disorder.
Due to its central location, the elbow joint is considered to be the most important joint of the upper limb from a functional point of view.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the attending physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions at the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptomatics and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
There is little doubt today that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic care with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercises.
With the increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical peculiarities of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in the therapeutic principles took place in the last decades, the current status of which is presented in the present paper taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can lead to fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient of electrode sections palpable through the skin and located subcutaneously can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode courses and transmuscular subclaviapunction.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
The present review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility to analyze structures in individual steps with precision.
From the electronic memory, image planes that are not representable with conventional technology can be reconstructed without problems.
Surface and transparency modes also allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different display options and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early gravity.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 h on the first postoperative day.
After transient paresthesia, burning pain in the legs, associated with motor and sensory infiltration failure, occurred as a result of the accidental infusion up to segment TH 11. The disease picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as the one described above are usually due to errors, the occurrence of which, although not impossible, can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include colour marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions, as well as using syringe pumps with a larger reservoir of drugs to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The examination of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has so far been neglected in dental implantology.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of jaw ridge height and width, the first analysis was made of 95 toothless bony upper jaws from collections, which were standardized sawed, measured and classified.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implants were simulated on 269 cross sections and evaluated differentiated according to implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
In the clinical part of the study, a similar procedure was followed in 24 consecutive implant patients with a toothless upper jaw.
Implant placement on the corpse jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but with sufficient jaw height a further 4.5% was actually expected.
Implant length reductions were additionally necessary in 6%.
There were dependencies to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross sections offered much more favourable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not given in any of the 24 patients.
Primarily insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times with sufficient height a transversally too narrow alveolar ridge turned out only under the operation.
The results allow the quantification of the significance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimension.
This importance is primarily due to bone height, although reductions in implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, both the corpse jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and the patient (8%) remain alveolar ridge profiles, for which the sole height measurement fake false conditions and possibly a precisely planned surgical procedure must be stopped.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the significance of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even demand, therefore, in principle, extended section diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique to investigate metabolic processes and non-morphological changes.
Because tumours have increased glycolysis, these can be detected by means of radiolabelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proved successful in different tumor entities.
In this study PET was studied in urinary bladder carcinoma lymph node staging.
In 64 patients, pelvic PET was performed preoperatively after IV injection of fluorine deoxy glucose (FDG), so that the PET result could be compared with the histological findings of the surgical preparation after classic operative lymph node staging.
In lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
Thus, PET results are encouraging and appear to be better than classical staging techniques such as CT and MRI.
Of 220 patients with chronic relapsing rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had total subnormal immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and / or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
Despite conservative therapy, chronic infections of the sinuses persist, so mucosal sinus surgery is indicated, which, however, can not bring the desired success with this disease alone.
An immune subclass deficiency should be evaluated as an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions to severe immune deficiency with development of malignancies are observed.
We report a 64-year-old patient with extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions in the right half of the torso as well as the right leg along the Blashko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis commonly seen in childhood.
There was a marked decrease in lesions when treated with acitretin.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - especially the "adult blashkitis" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urincontinence after rectum resection has increased after nerve-sparing preparation and complete excision of mesorectum have spread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinine incontinence are found in the literature between 25 and 67%.
Material and Methods:
On 10 corpses and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic preparations, the autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were represented.
Their location relationship and possible places of damage were presented and photodocumented during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with little interindividual variability.
The inferior P. mesentericus forms a dense fiber network around the inferior A. mesenterica (AMI) trunk at a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The front surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillier fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated by means of standard surgical access.
1. The nomenclature of fasciae and the course of autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly understood in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close situational relationship between rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes a sharp preparation under direct view inevitable.
4. Fascias and nerves can be used as guiding structures in preparation.
5. The selective protection of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via the standard surgical access.
Early detection of second carcinoma in primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is significant in prognosis and pioneering in therapy planning.
In a prospective study from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx and lip were panendoscoped as part of the staging to examine whether this method could be used to diagnose simultaneous secondary cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract at an early stage.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
It was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso-, oro- and hypopharynx.
The conclusion was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second cancers was 8.4%.
Precancerous diseases could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and two retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Regensburg Tumor Center (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary cancers in a primary in the "head-neck area."
Due to the good experience so far and the complicationless course of events, this examination obviously does not create any additional risk for the patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging in tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's Chorea can cause considerable problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the onset of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with a secured Huntington's Chorea, in which over 7 years the psychopathological changes were the main symptoms and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of illness compared to other sick family members were extraordinary and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of bringing forward the onset of the disease is well documented in literature in the case of transmission of the mutant gene from the father.
Differential diagnostic groundbreaking were the attention to the initially discreet abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed survey of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different emphases:
As climate therapy, as (balneo-) phototherapy or in a psychosomtic framework.
As certain patient groups benefit from this in different ways, indications for psychosomatic treatment are identified:
This applies to the concurrent presence of dermatological disease and mental disorder.
In addition, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological genesis or with psychological involvement, if there is depression, functional discomfort, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation.
In case of problems in disease processing, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
The significance of orthopaedic aids such as bandages and orthoses in functional disorders in the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle joint is shown below.
Then the mechanisms of action of the orthoses described in the literature in relation to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influence of sports performance as well as proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present paper deals with long-term changes on cemented polyethylene ladles of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to shape changes in polyethylene to varying degrees.
The amount of abrasion becomes detectable by the displacement of the hip head in the pan.
Within the first few years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head shift of 0.5 mm.
It oscillates after about 5 years to values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Head displacement values exceeding 0,2 mm per year are considered to be unfavourable in terms of denture loosening.
In this study, for a total of 369 hip replacements, the center of the hip head was determined in relation to the marking wire of the pan and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average duration of 77 months, 96% of ceramic heads (n = 109) had a abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this value was only reached in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
Polyethylene - ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared with polyethylene - metal pairing.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If there is an indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who are unable to give their consent, the supervisor's approval is required to carry out the healing treatment.
The district court of Hamburg, referring to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, had assumed the justified risk of longer-lasting health damage and had affirmed the approval requirement.
However, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapy measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis, taking into account the contraindications.
The application of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and expression of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the risks posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, a guardianship court approval requirement under the Care Act is to be denied.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal-dominant inheritance by volatile anaesthetics and succinylcholine, among others.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH group represents the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH predisposition due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations on the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) could be detected on the RYR1 gene in an individual in an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the conformity with IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system disorders of the child are relatively uniform sonographically:
Initial lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disturbance of normal echotexture are usually found in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
Sonographically, 4 infiltration patterns are observed on the parenchymatous organs:
Diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "bulcky type."
Ultrasound results in the normalization of lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity and the regression of tumor and inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic indications result from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as with some reservation on the basis of the echogenicity and the Dopplersonographically analyzable blood circulation characteristics.
The primary diagnosis must always be histologically confirmed.
Background and question.
The transient acantholytic dermatosis first described by Grover in 1970 is usually clinically itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
In today's unclear etiology, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
