If we find that the content of this manual page is outdated and causes obvious confusion and complaints, we will stop publishing it. There is no other option, like updating the Info file and updating the man manual, because other maintenance work on Gnu cc is not left to us to do this. The GNU Project considers man pages to be obsolete and time should be spent elsewhere.

DESCRIPTION (DESCRIPTION) The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but as far as the compiler is concerned, the suffix controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and sets the link in c form,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file, and sets the link in c++ form.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and later operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.i preprocessed c file; compile, assemble
.ii preprocessed c++ file; compile, assemble
.s assembly language source program; assemble
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assemble
.h Preprocessor files; files with other suffix names that do not usually appear on the command line are passed to the linker (Linker). Usually include:
.0 object file (Object file)
.a Archive file (Archive file)
Linking is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or compilation errors prevent the complete process).
In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to source programs, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including specified .o H standard files and .a library files) are passed to the linker in the order in the command line OPTIONS
Options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from '-d -r '.
Most '-=E: and '-W' options have two opposite forms: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly indicate that the language of subsequent input files is language (instead of the default selection from the filename suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option .language optional
Turn off any explicit specification of the language, so subsequent files are processed according to the file name RE AS E '-x' option).
If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use '~-c', '-s', or the '-E' option tells geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (for example, '-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces source file names with '.o' followed by '.ec'. Other names can be selected using the -o option.
the target file.
Stops after compiling, no assembly is performed.
Use pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers on those systems cannot read from pipes. The GNU assembler does not have this problem. C "dialects" accepted by assemblers: Support ANSI compliant C programs.
This will turn off some of the feature keywords in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as the ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that are denoted as welcome and rarely used, and even if used (Note: Hosted environment (hosted environment) is available in all standard libraries, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not exist in the standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)
For function declarations without parameters, such as'int foo ();', treat them C-style --- that is, do not specify the number or types of parameters. (C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo means in C++ that the argument is empty.
Section listings are cut here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, we've removed the details so that people don't HERI when the content becomes obsolete.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has the added effect of allowing assignment to this.
It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp Attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Specifically what is mentioned above about the preprocessor, but not other effects of the '-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allow '$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the '"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the '$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allow implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal--templates Generate smaller code (c++ only) for template declarations by, for each template function, making a copy only where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' (definition) or '#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using templates.
When a program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates ', template instantiations are all external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with typedefs, which refer to each instance needed.
Correspondingly, when compiling with the default '-fno-exteznal-templates' option, all template instances are explicitly set as built-ins.
All member functions (except constructor functions and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the enclosing class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it will be called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allow type mismatch between the second and third arguments of the condition expression.
The value of such an expression is Void. -fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (c++ only).
Incorporating user-defined free storage management into C++ made assignable'this' anachronistic.
Therefore, by default, assignment to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can enable this with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Define char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type. It may be unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the signedness of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only plain char, and expect this to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is written for).
This option, and its inverse, make that program work on the corresponding default.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no'signed' or "unsigned' modifiers are explicitly specified, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bitfields are signed, because the underlying integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings Store string constants in the writable data segment, and do not treat them specially.
This is for compatibility with older programs, who consider changing string constants to be a very bad idea. The '-traditional' option has the same effect.
executive summary
Impact of COVID-19 on drug markets
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services to the point of collapse, and restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruption in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the outbreak is unclear and difficult to predict, but could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.
The shift brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are some lessons that can be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek out cheaper synthetic substances, and usage patterns shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments responded to the current recession in the same way, interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be lowered in priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled via commercial flights.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. The use of commercial air travel to supply drugs could be completely disrupted as restrictions on air passenger traffic are imposed almost everywhere.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, there is likely to be an increase in trafficking using the darknet and postal delivery of goods.
In the long run, the recession and associated lockdowns could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, the poor and vulnerable will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders, and turn to illicit drug-related activities - whether producing or transporting them.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to bolster their ranks.
With reduced government capacity to respond, these shifts could quickly take hold as the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
market growth
Population Growth Patterns partly Explain Market Expansion
Drug use has been increasing around the world, both in overall figures and as a percentage of the world's population who use drugs.
In 2009 there were an estimated 210 million drug users, or 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018 there were an estimated 269 million drug users, or 5.3% of this population.
During the past two decades, drug use has grown much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.
This partly reflects differences in overall population growth over the period, 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects faster growth in younger populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
Drug use is more common in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive movement of people from rural to urban areas - more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization tends to be more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.
Likewise, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among wealthier segments of society.
However, the higher rates of transition to substance use disorders are among those of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a handful of countries show a link between harmful drug use patterns and conditions and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to increased drug use, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work around the world.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug market The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers to increase or engage in illicit crops, either because the control capacity of national authorities is reduced, or because in the economic crisis more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities.
Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of reduced air and land traffic due to COVID-19-related restrictions, where the risk of interception is low and higher volumes are smuggled than by air or land.
Recently there have been reports of shipments of cocaine directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The presence of substances not under international control is stable, but new and potentially harmful opioids are on the rise The drug market is becoming more complex.
To the plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of medicines is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new active substances per year on the domestic market of Member States.
Most of these are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
While the overall number of NPS has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Opioid NPS accounted for only 2% of the total number of NPS identified in 2014, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.
The NPS opioids, many of which are analogues of fentanyl, have proven efficacy and harm, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that injecting NPS stimulants also occurs in Europe: A study of the residues of discarded syringes in six European cities finds that many are stained with NPS that produce stimulants"
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become firmly established in vulnerable groups
A single class of NPS almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of NPS in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drugmakers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers are always looking for alternatives - not just less regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent them, so-called "designer precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: in March 2020, shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia were reported to have contributed to increases in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replacing opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by Russian Federation authorities has fallen by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has dropped significantly.
But the doping market seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in recent seizures of clandestine laboratories manufacturing a variety of illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern alongside "captagon" and tramadol.
A 2015 study reinforced these findings, with drug users saying marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "captagon" or methamphetamine.
More recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the importation of large quantities of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.
Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily rising since then.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 totaled 657kg - a sharp jump from the previous year.
Large seizures in other countries of methamphetamine thought to have originated in Afghanistan also suggest that production in that country is rapidly rising.
Policy Changes and Trends
Jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical use of marijuana among adults has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or near-daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012 level.
All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use.
Short-term data from Canada also show that the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019 while usage increased.
However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illicit sources.
Is marijuana legalization behind plummeting global marijuana herb seizures?
Global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, as seizures in North America fell, falling by 84% over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of NPS appears to have a deterrent effect The domestic regulation of NPS remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for NPS show different prevalence of NPS use.
In other countries, the use of NPS has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable populations face harm from legal and illicit drug markets Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries Pain relief is unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for approximately 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries, home to 88% of the global population, consume less than 10% of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a substance use disorder Some 35.6 million people suffered from a substance use disorder in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries where individuals' unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a certain point in time - are also associated with drug use disorder risk.
Drug use disorders can also deepen socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders or experience problems accessing treatment services.
The wider societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years, according to the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) indicator, which estimates years of healthy life lost to disability and premature death.
Global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17% between 2007 and 2018.
The increase in DALYs associated with liver cancer from untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is intricate and difficult to establish all causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data worldwide suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a bigger role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be attributed in part to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity resulting from personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of high-profile criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
latest trends
Marijuana is most commonly used substance, opioids most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
But the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked due to the low number of users.
Substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to substance use disorders in 2017 and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to be lost to drug-related disability or premature death.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general drug use patterns, are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by readily available and cheaply produced substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has contributed to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.
Part of the reason fentanyl is responsible for overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.
The market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.
There is an increasing number of patients receiving treatment for tramadol use disorders in the region.
The amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly in 2017, peaking at more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
Contributing to the crisis in both places is the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors.
Compounding the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available in both pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their abuse even more difficult to detect and prevent.
Doping use on the rise
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing rising use in their major markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used ATS in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been increasing in both regions for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can co-exist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that use of one drug rises while the use of the other falls, sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet demand in the same market.
COVID-19 Puts Injecting Drug Users at Higher Risk
An estimated 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections are attributable to injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
Of the estimated 585,000 drug deaths in 2017, half were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among people who inject drugs.
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute for more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
More harmful patterns of use may emerge as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.

EU summit debates on refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks in the admission process-Chinanews.com
EU summit quarrels over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks in every step of the admission process
[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, which makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's move is in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which is now at the heart of the EU's low number of illegal immigrants who end up being deported.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funding" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats in some member states said if the EU shared the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the process.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks in every step of the refugee admission process. "Permanent Crisis."
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries could deport illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state.
In addition, the report said, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state," which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com
Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has been escalating. First, under the pressure of the U.S., the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all connections between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to restrict U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry... 2023 will soon begin, the U.S. has continued to make evil moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "chips." While precisely suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it is building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely "get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technical alliance," or to establish a chip "four-party alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "four-party mechanism" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework," the United States has introduced the semiconductor industry by means of politicization, blocization, and weaponization, in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's "core tactics" against China with great fanfare is also "injury to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury to eight hundred."
Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export ban on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography machine giant ASML recently warned that the ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to higher semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government imposed brutal suppression on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process takes 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced manufacturing processes, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regional development of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, severely damaging the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively promulgating the "Innovation and Competition Act," "American Competition Act of 2022," "Chips and Science Act," using technological hegemony to consolidate its leading edge in technology; it has forced Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, trying to ensure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused troubles for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced China's chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs, depriving itself of the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products are on sale and can be held for a minimum of 360 days-Chinanews.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale
7 products from home institutions are optional, and the shortest period can only be held for 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally launched.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products. Seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially launched.
So far, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally collected four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all open-ended public offering net worth products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for 1 product that is a mixed product, the remaining 6 products are fixed income products.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily saw that 4 of the 5 new products came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products, and the minimum holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days. The corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70%-4.20%, 4.10%-4.60%, 4.40%-4.90%, 5.25%-5.75%.
The remaining one newly released product is "Post Bank Fortune Tianyi · Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1," which is also a fixed-income product. The fundraising started on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is Level 2.
Among the two surviving products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management "ABC Tongxin Smart" 360-day technological innovation RMB wealth management product, the investment nature is mixed, the risk level is three.
Another surviving product is "Post Bank Fortune Tianyi · Hongjin No. 1 with the shortest holding period of 365 days," which is a fixed-income type. It started to raise funds on December 30 last year. It was officially launched on January 4 this year, and its cumulative net worth on February 8 is 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions," the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies."
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public offering fund products and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice specifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in 36 leading cities and regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiongan New District, and Jincheng in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants will be 19.54 million, the number of contributors will be 6.13 million, and the total payment amount will be 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot had only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public offering funds.
Now that personal pension wealth management products are also available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D Department of Bank of Communications Wealth Management Products said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension wealth management products in the pilot phase and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
The first is robustness. The risk management mechanism is more complete, the investment strategy and philosophy are more stable, and the third-party independent custody of the non-parent bank is implemented.
The second is long-term. The term of pension wealth management products in the pilot phase is 5 years or more. The personal pension wealth management products issued in the next step have a minimum holding period of 1 year in principle, and are encouraged to hold more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness. The product purchase threshold is low. The minimum purchase point is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The product custody fee, management fee and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should make choices based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate, and high security, which are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks but can accept stable returns; however, personal pension wealth management products and public offering fund products do not guarantee capital or income, and have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are relatively high, and they are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-taking ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Chinanews.com
Another large gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness members' rights protection issues have attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Later, rumors about the organization's closure and escape caused panic among members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human resources and social security departments.
In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil subsided.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers can calmly wait for the problem to be resolved. Why do many members' first reaction is "something is not good"?
Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Traditional domestic gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money that users can't come" is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to repeat itself, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information about industries such as running in the gym frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms can of course be regarded as a good business with "money prospects."
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted the attention of capital.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of healthy living deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation is, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. Just after coming out of the crisis, they sounded the clarion call to expand the territory and invested all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in the past few years, many institutions have withdrawn and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, powerful companies are selectively increasing their acquisitions and reorganizing their layout. This may not be a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and take a steady and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change its business strategy.
Only by working steadily and re-establishing the trust and sense of security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry needs now is to settle down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the "user orientation," closely focus on user needs, and focus on improving service quality and upgrading.
Second, rely on digital transformation to improve user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model enables users to pay per view and choose venues on their own.
At the same time, body data and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and realize a complete closed-loop service from online to offline.
There is no personal training promotion, no huge annual card, users are less worried about "running away" from fitness institutions, and their sense of trust is also improved.
In addition, we should actively explore diversified business forms.
Today, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scene consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy expensive refund price difference!
Nanjing property market reappears "payment for price difference"-Chinanews.com
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement" that had not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market. Before the house is handed over, the discount of other housing sources is greater than the previous discount, and the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many conditions for the "guaranteed price agreement"
This real estate located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyun Terrace. Mr. Sun, the viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he was shopping for real estate last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the real estate promises that anyone who purchases a house between February 1 and February 28 will start from the date when the two parties sign the sales contract until the corresponding house is delivered. If the preferential discount of other houses is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous house purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial house), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price protection agreement," the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease and don't have to worry about the price reduction of the development company. "Now I'm afraid that the price will be reduced after buying it. Go to the sales office to make trouble. No time, if you don't make trouble, it's really heartwarming."
There are still many house buyers who believe that although the "price protection agreement" is to give house buyers "reassurance," the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a new house in Jiangbei, said that the price-insured house must first be of the same type, and must be in the same building and the same unit. There are very few houses that buyers can compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
There are also buyers who believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during the sale, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights."
Whether it can keep house buyers remains to be seen
The reporter inquired on the real estate online in Nanjing and learned that the real estate sold a total of 252 suites in two buildings in November last year. The price is 39843 yuan/m2.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this building is 157, accounting for 62.3%. There are also 44 unsold sets, and the total number of transactions of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, the "guaranteed price agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Price Guarantee Plan" in order to attract the attention of house buyers. The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the preferential margin of the project is expanded within a year, the difference will be refunded to the old owner."
Afterwards, in April 2011, 9 real estate properties in Nanjing took out part of their listings and promised to "compensate for the price difference."
"The property market is picking up, and at this time we need a shot of'heart booster'.
"Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the "price protection agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that development companies need more confidence than house buyers nowadays, and the launch of the "price protection agreement" is actually to encourage them.
As for whether the buyers can be retained, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen at present.
A number of data recession, Taiwan's economy performed poorly in the beginning of the year - Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume is "five blacks in a row," the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) has shrunk for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen "3 prefix..."Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
According to expert analysis, Taiwan's economy performed poorly at the beginning of the year, and the growth pressure is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, an annual decrease of 21.2%, and it was the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
Compared with the same period last year, the export value of 11 major export categories all declined.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the most, with an annual decrease of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components and components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, head of the statistics department of the department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, and the excess amount was only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the decline in global end-use demand and the adjustment of industrial inventories have restrained manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials. The decline in exports will hardly improve in the short term. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to Taiwan's Zhonghua Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, PMI takes 50% as the line of prosperity and decline, and an index greater than 50% means that the economy is expanding, and vice versa is contraction.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment tightened, suppliers' delivery times decreased, and inventories tightened.
The six major industries all reported PMI contraction, and the industries were ranked according to the speed of contraction as electric power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optical industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw material industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, Taiwan's "General Office of Accounting and Accounting" announced that in January this year, the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI was 3.04%, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's "General Office of Accounting and Accounting," said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and is still high.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on the reports of Taiwan's media such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance."
Wu Daren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University," analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, which affects the labor market and the household economy, which in turn impacts consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is still unresolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue into the first half of the year.
Since Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, affected by the sluggish exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An important engine for global recovery"-Chinanews.com
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary consultant of China Policy Observation Network, said in an interview with our reporter that the current epidemic prevention and control in China has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various shocks beyond expectations, China responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, which fully demonstrated its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening up to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development has been continuously strengthened, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have developed in coordination.
Every year, China's National Two Sessions are held. Representatives and committee members discuss national development plans and hot issues of people's livelihood. They gather consensus, people's hearts, and wisdom to add strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and is now entering a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions, and expects that China's development will bring new opportunities to the world.
"Rios said that China is currently making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development. "Fund investment, talent training, and policy incentives will make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan."
In Rios' view, economic reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China not only leverages the strengths of the market economy, but also leverages the superiority of the socialist system, and takes proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increase financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the multi-level and diversified consumption needs of the people ...China's complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, efforts to promote high-quality development, and the construction of a new development pattern will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
"Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
"Rios said that he looks forward to the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" cooperation to continue to play its important role in improving the level of infrastructure in various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

"New variables" have emerged in China's e-commerce industry. How to bring goods to "content is king"?
- Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, February 11. Question: "New variables" have emerged in China's e-commerce industry. How to bring goods to "content is king"?
China New Finance reporter Xia Bin
"We entered e-commerce late, but we realized from the very beginning that content is very important to stand out from thousands of stores.
"Fang Fang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, now runs a nourishing ingredients store on Douyin e-commerce, making an offline store with a history of more than 30 years "blossom" online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong movies, accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, open the account of @Fang Fang One-person Food Douyin, the exquisite video is refreshing.
At the recently held Douyin e-commerce "Looking for Companions·High-quality Content Sharing Session," Fang Fang, as a representative of high-quality creators, spoke at the scene and introduced her daily creative experience and experience.
She said at the scene: "The meticulously polished video has gained the attention of many netizens, many people are interested in my food ingredients, want to cook food together, the sales immediately opened up.
"
Fangfang made more people fall in love with the "Taste of Lao Guang" by making soup videos. She sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients in one live broadcast, saving her family's old store that was on the verge of bankruptcy.
"No content, no e-commerce," with the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of the development of live streaming, live broadcast rooms often used low-price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenon-level big Vs such as Liu Genghong and Dongfang Selection, as well as many unknown talents and merchants in the vertical segment. They continue to create high-quality content that matches their own brand tonality, and improve the long-term business benefits.
According to Gao Yaxuan, head of Douyin e-commerce star author operations, 6.27 million creators have monetized content through Douyin e-commerce in the past year. Their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and their total turnover has more than doubled.
"Behind these figures, we can feel a thriving and vigorous author ecology.
"Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experiment Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report," which analyzed the "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry from the data dimension - the importance of high-quality content, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 domestic mainstream e-commerce platforms.
According to the ranking of the content ecological health index of the e-commerce industry in the above report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com rank in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user-generated content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the more abundant the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption will be higher as the public and private domains are gradually integrated and distributed.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, made an analysis and interpretation of the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to "consumption quality," and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leader) has begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of content structure improvement, create positive content creation and management standards, and realize the index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry content ecological health system.
The other is from the perspective of external ecology, it is necessary to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to form a prediction on the stability of future development; in addition, it will provide businesses with a more standardized and healthy growth space, and realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, and products in the e-commerce industry to create a healthy content ecosystem.

Title: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - - Four Discussions to deeply understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
Xinhua commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall promotion, and correctly handles top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and self-improvement and opening up to the outside world.
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar on the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China for members, alternate members, and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels of the Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization, in-depth and systematic elucidation of a series of major relationships that need to be dealt with in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It is related to all aspects of governance of the party, state, military, internal affairs, foreign affairs, and national defense.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have a deep insight into the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated planning and policy system can reflect the times, grasp the laws, and be full of creativity.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many unknown areas, which need to be boldly explored in practice and promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation.
Strategic issues are the fundamental issues of a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking nature of the strategy, foresee and lead the future with a scientific strategy; it is necessary to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving major issues that have a bearing on the success or failure of the cause of the Party and the country, and affect the whole body; to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it must be adhered to for a long time, grasped to the end, and done well.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical and unified relationship between strategy and tactics, organically combine the principle of strategy with the flexibility of strategy, be flexible, adapt to the situation, and make decisions on the fly, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting measures to local conditions, moving in accordance with the situation, and following the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
To properly handle the relationship between integrity and innovation, we must not only keep the foundation and source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also we must put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize changes and adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly shape new development momentum and advantages, and fully stimulate the whole society. Create vitality.
Efficiency is an important basis for fairness, and fairness is a powerful guarantee for efficiency.
When we promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also more effectively maintain social fairness, and better realize the balance, promotion and unity of efficiency and fairness.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of being involved in the spy balloon program.
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize China's military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty accessing U.S. technology exports.
Known as the "entity list," companies on the list will not be able to buy technology or goods from US suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the US Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Eagle Gate Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Before that, the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten US national security.
The balloon incident sparked further tensions between the US and China, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceling a visit to China.
The US shot down the balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government lodged stern representations with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously impacting and damaging both sides' efforts and process of stabilizing Sino-US relations.
From the evidence of the existing wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and is an approved supplier by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding the accident that a Chinese unmanned civil airship strayed into the U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress is purely political manipulation and hype.
China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this.
"Today's action demonstrates our concerted efforts to identify and deter China's use of spy balloons that violate the United States and 40 countries," said Assistant Secretary of Commerce Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod.
"
An employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co Ltd said it had no knowledge of the sanctions and declined further comment, Reuters reported.
The Chinese embassy in the United States has not yet commented on the information.

The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced the allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Bureau announced a few days ago that it plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from this budget in the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists to return.
In order to make health and wellness one of the tourism highlights in Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board released a call for expressions of interest on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the south coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, executive director of sports and wellness tourism of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists put their health at the top of all considerations.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area with Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Chen Jianlong, director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness and needs for physical and mental health.

Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the tourism bureau will pay close attention to the further signals released by China's outbound travel policy in order to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in Chinese outbound travel.
Looking forward to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public income, and there are no new large-scale deadly outbreaks, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.

Based on South Korean "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Li Xuezhu with their daughter Kim Joo-ae attending the dinner on the 7th, Kim Joo-ae is not only rarely sitting in the C seat between his parents, but also on the 75th anniversary of the Army Day the next night, she also stood on the rostrum with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" released a video of the military parade afterwards, exposing more scenes of the deep love between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the rostrum. The smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Joo-ae cupped his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also showed that when Kim Joo-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on an indoor sofa chair, she kept touching her father's face with her hands; when she and her father were walking arm in arm, they touched Kim Jong-un's chest with their hands.
The first lady, Li Xuezhu, could only walk behind or sit aside, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo-ae made his first public appearance on November 18 last year when he test-fired the Hwasong-17 missile, the probability of exposure has been increasing in the past three months, and this is the fifth time he has appeared on a formal occasion.
North Korean state media mentioned Kim Joo-ae using extremely high titles such as dearest son and honored son, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Joo-ae repeatedly shouting and vowing to support the white-headed blood while overlooking the military parade from the stands.
These signs make the outside world doubt whether Kim Joo-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle-school-aged daughter to the position of successor." However, there are also views that such a judgment is still too early. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son, there are still various possibilities.
Chongyang Q&A - How to view the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeding expectations and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-agricultural employment data for January 2023. New non-agricultural employment was 517,000, much higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in the past 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, a slight slowdown.
From the perspective of the total amount, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in the data this time, such as the faculty and staff returning to work on strike, the revision of the survey statistics, and the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (refer to 2022 1 The increase in non-agricultural employment was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-touch service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, while the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background of the U.S. economy in 2023.
Superposition is now approaching the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations continue to fluctuate. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of the data, the US stock, bond and exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects to stop raising interest rates early, but also expects two cut interest rates.
In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impacts of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded transactions may cause some damage to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. As the M2 data turned negative year-on-year and the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items gradually improved, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of games.
Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, died of a heart attack
Economic Observation Network reporter Zheng Yuxin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holding") issued an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holding, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment for heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Enterprise Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the Shanshan brand accounted for 37% of the market.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, Shanshan suits want to always lead the way, it is unlikely to become the national service of Chinese people in the long term."
In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to do in transformation. We specially found many experts and scholars, and held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars continuously.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy's carbon research institute supporting Ansteel was working on the national 863 project, and the research funds were not enough, so Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with the carbon research institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realized the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesocarbon microspheres, and began to replace Japan as the main supplier of mesocarbon microspheres in China.
This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was included in the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year until 2013. Shanshan's lithium battery material business has more revenue than its clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established Shanjin Optoelectronics, a polarizer company. This field has relatively high technology content. Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "The probability of success for Chinese private enterprises to acquire some international high-tech companies is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I have spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, right? This is a common behavior." However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan's acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanshan Optoelectronics publicly announced that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, Shanshan Enterprises will not send people to Shanjin, and adopt the method of authorization. The original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other models remain unchanged.
ICC Xinyu Information released the negative electrode data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative electrode shipments in 2022 will exceed 200,000 tons, a year-on-year increase of 100%, and its market share will reach 16%. The shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode materials will continue to top the list.
In terms of polarizer business, statistics from Yano Research show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics will have a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan's revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, Shanshan's stock price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphitization production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization production capacity of the Meishan project is still climbing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan shares.
According to Tianyan Check, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total equity of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Shanshan Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the investor interaction platform on February 10 that there is no kinship relationship between the company's senior management and the company's actual controller.
"Fund E Account" is here: China Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes the development of all funds under the investor's name to achieve collection and query - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observation Network reporter Chen Shan Does the complexity of fund purchase channels make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forget the "little treasury"?
These problems of Christianity are about to be solved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was put on the shelves of various mobile phone application stores and launched a public trial run.
According to reports, the "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve industry service pain points such as forgetting accounts and cumbersome inquiries for small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there are 156 public fund managers in China, with a fund management scale of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 public fund share registration agencies, and 411 public fund sales agencies.
The account systems of each share registration agency are independent of each other, and there is no unified inquiry channel for the industry.
Some people in the industry said that by the end of 2021, there will be more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the people in the country have invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about the purchase status through different sales agencies, but through the "fund E account," they can inquire about the purchase status of all sales channels, and the fund holding status is clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a public offering fund industry portal mobile application developed and constructed by China Settlement with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which can provide investors with one-stop inquiries on the off-market share holdings of public offering fund products in the whole market.
Investors can use the "Fund E Account" to conveniently and quickly grasp the holdings of the off-market shares of the public offering fund products of each fund manager purchased by them through various sales channels in the whole market, and comprehensively improve the query efficiency.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E Account" includes: information on fund accounts opened with managers of public funds in the market, information on trading accounts opened at sales agencies of public funds, and information on holdings of off-market share holdings of products including publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans established and managed by securities companies with no limit of 200 investors.
Liu Yiqian, business director of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observer.com reporter that investors can use the "Fund E Account" app to know all of their off-market public offering fund holdings in one stop and help them find "forgotten assets." More importantly, it has realized the collection of comprehensive fund investment information for customers, helping customers to grasp their own investment conditions in a more timely, accurate and complete manner, so as to better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register to use?
The reporter noticed that at present, the "Fund E Account" APP has been put on the shelves of mobile application stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, etc., but the APP is still in the stage of public trial operation. Registration requires filling in the invitation code. Investors can contact the fund manager holding the fund to obtain it.
The customer service staff of a medium and large public offering fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the reporter of Economic Observer.com, and told the reporter, "During the trial operation of the APP, China Settlement provided a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. Call and get it, and we'll provide it.
After the trial run is over, the invitation code will not be needed when opening user registration.
"
The reporter registered the account and completed the query according to the download of the "Fund E Account" published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the relevant documents for use. The whole process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, public offering fund inquiries.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "assets" fund binding button, and all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms will be displayed in the binding option list (account can be bound), and you can see the total assets of the invested fund directly after the binding is completed and you can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E Account" only provides inquiry services for investors, and cannot be used for redemption and trading.
The date of data displayed in the "Fund E Account" is generally three trading days before the date of the user's query (T day).
For example, if you open the "Fund E Account" on February 10, the corresponding date of the total assets, fund shares, and fund net value displayed on the asset page is three trading days before that date, that is, February 7.

The U.S., Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's invasion of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they will sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to the Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos visited China in early January this year and won deals worth US$20 billion.
But after that, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the CCP" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: under the 1992 consensus, green camps are welcome to visit the mainland
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, during his visit to China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Affairs Foundation, an official organization of the Kuomintang, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, and positively commented on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that as long as he agrees with the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes people from the green camp to visit the mainland.
The KMT commented that it was something new.
The news on the day Xia Liyan met Song Tao earlier did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party clarified its rejection of the "1992 Consensus" for several days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit China. During their stay in Beijing, they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and said that the political basis of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior consultant of the Kuomintang Foundation, said at the meeting that the "1992 Consensus" of the Kuomintang is the original "1992 Consensus."
According to Zhao Chunshan's analysis, this is different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In recent video conferences with academic circles in mainland China, as well as in this conference, we did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about military reunification and the "anti-secession law." Instead, we resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are fighting fiercely, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party, the other party is still willing to do a good job in dealing with the Taiwanese, which means that they do not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally ordered to tell Song Tao, "You must implement the demands they (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) raised."
The report did not mention whether the KMT members visited the mainland to mention the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military planes and warships, the agricultural and fishery issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether reporters from the Central News Agency asked such questions in interviews.
French trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's retirement reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's pension reform draft, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social unrest against the government's draft reform of the pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight major trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and it is also the first time that this protest has arranged a rally on Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people who don't have to choose between protesting or striking with wages, union groups are hoping today's rally will attract more people.
The unions of the public transportation system subway and the public railway company did not call for a strike today. The public transportation system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take cars to the assembly site.
Trade union groups hope more than a million people will turn out for today's rally, while police expect between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide and 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually took to the streets to participate in the demonstrations has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
The crowd of demonstrators on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people across the country.
The pension reform program is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition group headed by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, so that the review process is moving very slowly.
And the debate between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical leftist French Independence Party has sparked protests from the ruling party after he posted on social media a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the portrait of the labor minister on it.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the MP from parliamentary activities as punishment for such behaviour.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social unrest in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has slightly adjusted the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The trade unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th. On March 7, when the reform bill is sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade unions also plan to organize demonstrations.
China encourages the increase of fertility rate, urges sperm donation to colleges and universities, high quality standards
The Human Sperm Bank of China's Yunnan Province issued a promotion on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from those with a college degree or above or school students. If you successfully donate 8 to 12 times, you will receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the news rushed to Weibo hot searches that day, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a signed report by the Free Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
For sperm donation from colleges and universities in various places, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of 170 cm or more, good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and a degree of myopia no higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of andrological physical examination worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done it, which is of great significance to understand their fertility status."
The requirements for sperm donors include those with a height of 165 cm or more, a college degree or above or those who are studying, without color blindness, color weakness, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank of Shaanxi Province printed a promotional poster with "Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory," calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and "let the love spread."
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan. Those who pass the test can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who have completed a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
At present, the highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 RMB.
East Germany's last communist chancellor dies today
The party's successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall that had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modelo had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
When the Soviet Union came to power, Mikhail Gorbachev demanded changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modelo declared the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results resulted in him no longer serving as prime minister.
Despite Modelo's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modelo was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to jail.
Some say the charges are politically motivated.
Modelo went on to serve in the German parliament from 1990 to 1994 and as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modelo sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return but said it should be recognized for its achievements.
Modelo was born in 1928 in what was then the German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a machinist.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in a youth fire brigade and towards the end of the conflict became a member of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia organization that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the last struggles of the war.
At 17, Modelo was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist Party member.
He returned home in 1949, the year East Germany was founded, and found work as a machinist, and went on to study social sciences and economics, earning a Ph.D.
Modelo was a staff member of the Free German Youth movement, which nearly all young East Germans joined, and was promoted to the Dresden region by the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) between 1973 and 1989 party chairman.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
Modelo became the de facto leader of East Germany in 1990, holding the highest state office.
Pro-protest hackers hack president's televised speech as Iran marks revolution anniversary
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The president's televised speech was interrupted for about a minute on the Internet, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, who went by the name "Edalat Ali" (Justice Ali), appeared on the screen.
A voice was also seen shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic."
Hackers interrupted state television coverage as Iran marked the anniversary of its revolution, Reuters reported today.
As Iran officially marks the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Lacey's hardline government faces the boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Lacey still calls on "deceived youth" to repent so they can get Iran's supreme leader pardon.
Nationwide protests are still raging in Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iranian security forces have launched a deadly crackdown on protests in one of the most formidable challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution that toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the evening of the anniversary of Iran's revolution on Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!) ."
However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting "Death to the dictator!
"and "Death to the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, home-made anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacey's speeches were frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America" - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel."
Reuters said Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, was one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor that has soured relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she was back in jail.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Mesami's release came a week after supporters warned he was at risk of death as a result of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the mandatory wearing of the hijab.
Responding to Adelkhah's release on Friday, the French foreign ministry called for her freedom to be restored, "including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.
"
Will the balloon incident brighten the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a Wall Street Journal report today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support for stronger U.S. technology protections.
The United States said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of the hardliners on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities that pose threats to our national security and to our allies and partners.
U.S. officials said they had notified the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination was crucial to countering the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the U.S. House of Representatives' new ad hoc committee on strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the U.S. to take tougher measures to slow China's progress.
Members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force a tougher policy from the White House, she said.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also already formulating a foreign investment review plan to examine whether there are potential national security threats from China in U.S. overseas investments.
Analysts said the White House could face calls for a faster rollout of the program.

Since the powerful earthquake hit Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night among the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to free survivors buried under the rubble.
In freezing temperatures, they often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Reuters reported today that two more women had been rescued after surviving days in the rubble of the quake.
However, the death toll from the quake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several powerful aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster this century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 2003 quake in neighboring Iran that killed 31,000 people.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said Saturday.
Another injured man, identified as Masallah Cicek, 55, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sounds of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Crouching under concrete slabs and whispering "Inshallah" - "God bless" - in Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers gingerly reached into the rubble to free a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes widened as baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking his mother, who was dazed and pale but conscious on a stretcher.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with 31,000 rescuers mobilized in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were left homeless by the quake and crammed into makeshift shelters, he said.
Questions have grown about the leaders of both countries over their response to the disaster, as many people lack food in frigid winter conditions.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled with his wife Asma to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit since the earthquake, according to Syrian state media.
Earlier, the World Food Program said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
Erdogan, who visited Turkey's Adiyaman province on Friday, acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is up for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over delays in delivering aid and launching rescue efforts could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as Erdogan's most serious challenge in his two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a "passive campaign for political gain."
Kemal Kildaroglu, leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's response.
"The earthquake was big, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence," the critic said.

The University of Brunei Darussalam is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the regional university rankings.
Brunei University is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei formally established a cooperative relationship with FPT University in Vietnam. The main area of cooperation is English training.

What exactly was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
confusing, guesswork
The US military once again used its most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, US, on Friday afternoon (February 10).
It was shot down ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
A spy balloon from China was shot down near the coast of South Carolina after days of drifting in U.S. airspace on Saturday.
The second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), the Pentagon said. The car is about the same, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.
White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said Friday that while the high-flying object's exact appearance was unclear, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" suspended from it.
"What we call it an'object' is the best description we can currently make," Bryant said.
President Biden took the Pentagon's advice before ordering the object down, a decision he made "very carefully," Bryant added.
The US official description of this object can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is equivalent to a small car, there is no joystick, no suspension device, and the flying height is about 10,000 meters.
But this information cannot yet answer basic questions, such as what the object really is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.
At present, many analyzes and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, as did the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some kind of mission in a different location.
Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday, "Wish this'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO ."
"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict, "Major said.
Major's tweet came shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Major was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO, Newsweek said.
Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) criticized the administration's intelligence cover-up last month, demanding that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
I can't believe Amazon's customer service attitude
It is estimated that few people see this, but I also want to say a little bit.
This dress was a zipper hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short-sleeved one for me in the end.
Immediately after receiving the clothes, I got in touch with Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw that the name of the product changed to short sleeves. It turned out that the link I bought was taken off the shelf.
Then the customer service notified to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable that the wrong clothes are not my problem. As a consumer, I ask for the goods I should get, and I don't make any exaggerated demands. Amazon changes the name and says it's out of stock.
This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.
incomprehensible sleeves
It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, and it is not clear whether it is genuine leather. In addition, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of jackets are longer than the hem of the clothes, but usually only 1-2 centimeters, this dress is a full 5 centimeters long, the arms should naturally hang down in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returns are easy.
But I really don't know when to get the money back?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, because the size is too small, I had to return the goods, but after returning the goods, more than a week has passed, and I have not received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact the Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying Amazon items!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating with urging the express to refund in time, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, and the refund is delayed for about half a month. This kind of partner is to hold back Amazon. Poor work efficiency and no sense of service!
more suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the wool pants are all good, soft/thin and moderate, and have no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, the flat waist is 2 feet 5, the maximum stretch size is 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg, the waist is a bit tight.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen up the waistline.
Plus, it's uncomfortable to wear next to your body.
Very good color is not very bright
What's the situation when I just bought it and it went up by more than 200.
It was the first time that Amazon used the cooperative Tiantianba Express. The first delivery was not at home. Later, I took the initiative to make two delivery appointments with the courier. The courier refused to deliver, and then returned it directly to me. The courier has no integrity at all, and it is strongly recommended not to use that bad courier any more.
This time, I also returned a t-shirt, and the price was increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon self-operated should not appear such a product
I bought it when the product was on sale, the price is not low, and it is also a very good product after reading the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there were wears in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. The picture will be shown later.
I applied to return the product, and the people from the manufacturer saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation. Isn't this nonsense?
How can an item be worn down inside?
There are only two possibilities, either it is a defective product, or I damaged the product on purpose and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers who choose Amazon's self-operated products are trust, customer win, we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and there are two E2s, I don't know how to deal with it?
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 appeared on the two groups on the right side of the receiver. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is consistent with the continuous work of the transmitter module mentioned on the Amazon website. 7 years does not quite match, and I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don't know what to do now?
Okay
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was also torn.
And it's always a white screen.
It will be fine after changing.
The replacement is very fast, it is a bit blurry at night, and the viewing angle is not very wide, but it is enough for ordinary household use.
The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. Not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker like a chapter that can be attached to the warranty card. Not this time.
I don't know if it's because things are cheap, so I'm confused.
Waiting for supplier reply
There is no mark on the package, so I called the supplier directly and said that the answer is that there is no mark, it is a genuine product. If there is any doubt, I can mail it to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and leave the license plate number and phone number. I promise to send a text message to notify my information into Johnson & Johnson. The warranty card on the official website has not received a text message until now?
Received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon self-operated products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil is clear and it is indeed good oil.
Because it is the second purchase.
So I'm still very relieved.
The express delivery is fast, and the packaging is not picky. After using this oil, the engine sound has dropped significantly.
The price/performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic motor oil under 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, and effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitting mistakes, but always evading, always emphasizing that the goods are a third party, and the third party cannot be restrained.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The page size options I bought at the beginning were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought it was a trap. I called Nichia's Chinese customer service and told me that 8 was 8c, but I found out that it was only 8cm when the product returned to China. I think this is completely a trap deliberately set to trap Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now there is no such option on the viewing page.
Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we give you two ways:
1. You return the product, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the product, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.
(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which counts as 200rmb, choose 1, I don't have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.
Choice 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I replied an email, saying that I would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and it was over.
I proposed: when the purchase page has confusing options such as 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that Japanese common codes do not include c, similar to 140, but you guys have gone to other caterpillar pages to see it?
There is a mix of US and Japanese sizes.
Besides, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, it is obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you are going to ship it back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping cost.
I don't understand this logic again. I'm Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. China living in Japan doesn't need Chinese customer service. Visitors to Japan don't have the skills to make international long distance calls. Then the question arises, who needs to call Amazon's overseas purchases of Chinese phones are nothing more than day-to-day shopping like me.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for those of us overseas shopping?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. The baby used them all night One diaper can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L size diapers, there are 2 packs in a box and they are packed separately. After opening, I feel that the paper is loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for the baby, it is okay, there is no leakage of urine, no rash and other signs.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, a rash appeared on the inner thighs of the baby immediately after using it, and it hasn't faded yet.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packages in 1 box is not the same.
Should not continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for a long time. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed, and the card box was pressed open and deformed.
I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I would rather be half as expensive in China and have a guarantee.
And the product packaging problem, I read the comments in 2016, someone commented on it, and it is still the same in 19 years.
It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic JD.com and Tmall.
Beautiful, but a little sad
I really like the color of the whole cup, orange-red. Although my family is a boy, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed off, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertical, my son always had to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I think this place can be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Portable and large capacity
I like that it is light and has a large opening, but two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to pack.
After buying it, I found that there is another brand that is very similar on Overseas Buy Meiya, and it is less than 200 yuan.
Fake, fake is very powerful
Amazon sells fakes, and I'm convinced too.
The customer service said that the product cannot be returned because it has been used. How can I know it is a fake if it is useless?
Because of trust, I am sad. After all, it is a product for wiping your face. You should really go to a physical store to buy it. It is admitted that it is more expensive.
Because it is a spike, so I didn't read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.
broken?
Fake?
All in all tragic.
When I used the second piece, the pores were fine, but when I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one before, and then I couldn't stand it when I put it on my face. It smells very strong, indescribable, so smoked that I immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt, and tears flowed, so I took it off immediately to wash my face.
Buxinxie opened another slice of the same type, it doesn't have such a strong smell, and it's being applied now.
In retrospect, it kind of smells like bad perm water in the hair salon.
It's really unimaginable, is it difficult for Amazon's self-operated skin care products to be avoided from now on?
profiteer
When I bought it, the event page said that I would give away the "Complete Works of Three-Body" when I spent 99 yuan. When I received the goods, I didn't have this gift. I called customer service and said that I would show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who bought the things and saved the screenshots of the webpage. You need customers to provide you with the activities you have done yourself. Buyers should be careful next time and keep the evidence.
Feeling after use
This is the first time I bought something on Amazon. I have a few points of experience. Let's talk about the feeling of using up the product first. The first thing is that it is painless and has no irritating taste. Overall it is very good. Wait for 8 minutes or so and it will fall off after wiping, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it, which can't be seen unless you look closely, so overall it is good, as for after using it once, you need to continue to observe, and you will know if you continue to use it.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second is to place an order on the 27th and receive the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month, and the service attitude of Amazon's delivery staff is also very good.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it's nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping).
The customer service said that the price fluctuates. I have paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is like this, and the fluctuation is not big.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with granules, definitely repurchase!
There are granules in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand product. It says that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels. I don't know where they are wholesaled from.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand stores again.
Give me a suggestion, why sometimes the listing on Amazon's app can't be posted, I hope to improve some apps, and it will do better and better!
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Garbage Excellence does not consider customer needs. When placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive the mail at night.
It turned out that it was delivered directly to the door at 12:00 noon, without calling in advance.
If the delivery time is that your courier can deliver it at any time he wants, why bother to make a time for the customer to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then don't do e-commerce at all!
Let an old man with 3 wounds get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier, and he has to find change to pay!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of Joyo.com is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.
No change or compensation will be made!
I have encountered problems like this before, and I can bear it like the wrong delivery time, but this time I can't bear it, it's too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and the back cover were reversed, so there was an obvious quality problem, so you just closed your eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Leave a bad comment and no one will contact you.
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Won't spend a dime on excellence again.
Picture quality is really unacceptable
As a title like "Ancient Atlas," the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are so blurred that they cannot be recognized.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files.) What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
! I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.
There is no comment on the text, each buyers has their own differences.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. I just read and played with boredom. I feel that I should not be addicted to such a book. After all, the starting point's online articles were not very attractive to me in the past.
Then...it fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and happy. In the first part, when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even the intrigue between the guilds was not heavy at all because of Ye Xiu's blood.
As for the part about the competition, I wrote about the change of times and the alternation of old and new with a little bit of sadness (maybe I am sentimental).
It took me a lot of study time in the second year of high school to read the whole book, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time's descriptions of characters and emotional lines are very amazing. Some characters are only brought in occasionally, and they will leave a deep impact on people. For example, the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Muhe have a large number of fans, while the characters that are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc. are also very likable. In an e-sports cool article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is a full-time success in character description.
As for the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million beauties in the harem that are criticized by ordinary online articles. They are either beautiful or corrupt. Everyone's feelings in the full text have one thing in common, that is, they like the game of glory, and most want to win with dignity.
There are small measures but no big conspiracy, everyone looks so innocent and cute.
This may also be why there are no annoying roles full-time.
The full-time IP is huge, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, full-time is still a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood and a little touch.
In April of this year, full-time anime will be made.
In fact, I have been wanting to buy this set of books for a long time. Because my wallet is never thick enough, I didn't make up my mind to start. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on tb. In fact, the full-time recently released another version, the cover picture. I really like it myself, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I checked on Amazon and bought a set at once.
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●There is no plastic cover for the fourth book, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth book is in the plastic package but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange and it feels not as hard as others.
●The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.
●The publishers of individual books are different. It seems that the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, which is different from the others.
●On the whole, it is quite satisfactory. There are 24 books in a large box, which is very satisfying.
lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Missing Piece" but it turned out that there are a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finish reading this book to the children. A little lion who can shoot a gun, a little lion who loves to eat marshmallows.
When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete man.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he went.
Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and if she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.
Great value for money portfolio
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, the reason is that they are too powerful, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.
There have been 3 versions of this work. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, which is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest. It also comes with a book box for two volumes.
Personally, I think it is acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which are easy to read as paperbacks. Second, it is different from Michelangelo's complete works, which mainly consist of paintings. Da Vinci's black and white manuscripts account for the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last supper), but I don't know if it's the printing or the size of the book. Some shadows are too deep, and the details can't be seen clearly. Pity.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter's breadth of research and achievements are not enough to be described as geniuses.
If you could only understand half of Da Vinci by looking at the paintings before, you will be completely speechless after reading the manuscripts.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, this is really rubbish,  waste of money to buy, what, give me a reason!
1. The travel time is inaccurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time returns to zero.
2. Inferior belts are not made of silicone, and the wrists are allergic to blisters.
3. Often can not connect to the mobile phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics is too slow
It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but it was only received on the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too bad. Shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!
overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning, but this time it was okay, there is an inflatable bag inside, the three sizes of the camera are the same, and it can also be registered on the official website, the number of shutter times is 0, and the rest can only be tested by time.
The delivery speed is quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier guy here. The valuables are placed in the concierge, and they go fast. I can't open the box for inspection in front of him. I am really speechless about this.
The merchant has done it for the sake of customers before delivery:)
The merchant is more responsible, calling specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is indeed for the sake of the customer.
Delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also very suitable and effective.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good. I would like to ask why it is not fully charged after the first charge, and the charging indicator is always red.
At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel, so I can only give feedback in product reviews.
1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it shows that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released);
2. The content of the book pushed to the device on March 31 is blank, just stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan;
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again, but I cannot get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" that contains the actual content, but I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.
I have a few thoughts now.
1. The price issue is actually not the most important thing. The key is how to replace the blank books on the kindle with books with actual content, instead of downloading them forever and saying "stay tuned"
2. The pre-purchased book should not be bought again in the future. After all, if the ticket is skipped, and then download a book with empty content, the procedure seems very complicated;
3. I hope that Amazon will provide a normal channel to provide feedback on such problems. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there will be a place to give feedback (work orders and online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to Microsoft's official mall for how to do it.)
Not very recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see Write some thoughts from memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments about love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely flat, the kind of plain water, the choice of words and sentences pursues the ultimate simplicity, and the plot is as quiet and flat as a street in a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a sketch of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally, they were collected together and titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea dryness and rocks in urban legends, and it is not just the glue between you and me. Not only the above should not be represented by the above, love is also a life as plain as water, boring day after day, there is also a loss of life, evasion of reality, and confusion of the future.
As you read this book, you may have in your mind images of the arguing couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unfulfilling relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are boring, unless your life is rough or sweet like living in a candy castle, you will feel strange when you have to read it, not weird and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily plots did not catch people's eyes or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short clips did not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is also the reason for the relatively poor reading experience of this book.
Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not full enough.
It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It just points out the direction but does not give specific methods.
Plus, the book feels like a cobbled together piece.
For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.
I don't know if it is a story compiled for the sake of example, but it will be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author are given.
Change back and forth between customers and customers.
The title is still a customer, but the text becomes a customer.
There were also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.
In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
Quickly understand the guide book of Internet finance
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deep by yourself.
And the book was written earlier, and the later content of Alipay and WeChat's subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today's third-party payment share is probably not as small as the book said.
Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write Gao Dakong, but the hard thing is to write it in an easy-to-understand manner.
I appreciate you and want you to know more!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he has received enough attention and appreciation at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after people's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is to satisfy their psychological needs - hoping to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "I love you hard to express," even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it silently in their hearts and will not say it.
In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, timeliness, acts of service, desirable gifts, and physical touch.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from your heart to appreciate anytime, anywhere, and to be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate, and enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.
Due to reasons such as Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please review strictly by Amazon
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, not even as good as roadside stall products, no weight, no barcode, the ten-bag packaging is also loose, is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have applied for a return; It is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, added a few comparison photos to further verify the fakeness of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference to avoid economic loss and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope that Amazon will be meticulous and strictly control the source of products.
So-so product, not as expected
advantage:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and the blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is OK to use, but there is a gap between my expectations.
disadvantages:
1. There is no indicator light for charging, which basically saves your power indicator. It is estimated that customers who buy products worth 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also charity and have no respect.
2. There is a strong odor. When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
I tried it in the office for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.
Compared with the PHILIPS of the same price I have used before, although there is an extra cutter head, the quality of this Panasonic product is really sorry for consumers.
Small Package
When I received the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version on it, I knew it had fallen into the pit again. It was smaller than the one bought in the supermarket. It should be M. The packaging is different from the picture on the product introduction. The so-called new version.
The three stars are because I was sloppy and didn't read the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?
E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy when I have time.
Just sauce purple.
don't like the taste
The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste very much, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it. For the time being, this word is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during an event and it was very cheap, so I'm too embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Authentic yo well packaged
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag inside, and there are no online reviews, only a bare product.
There is still a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it arrived the next day after taking the photo.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.
A bad shopping experience
I placed the order on Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and didn't receive it. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and they said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said that the sender can initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly sent to someone else. After several rounds, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging has been removed, and the product is still intact. I don't know if it was used.
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but unexpectedly I received a headset like Figure 2. It's fine if the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the left and right earphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay attention to it. In addition, I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.
general operating system
After using it for a period of time, overall the picture is not bad, I can't feel any difference, but this system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a bit slow, and I can't make good settings, and the software I bring is not necessary. The response speed is even more general, which is not an order of magnitude compared with that of my colleagues.
I read comments that it is very user-friendly design, but I didn't find any human-friendly design. The commonly used remote control is up, down, left, right, and the position of the back button design is really not flattering.
So, just use it as a TV, and use it with a TV box and the like.
The price cut is too big
The price cut is too big, more than 100 yuan is now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this passage to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product accordingly.
Low price, good cable, no fever, that's enough!
Such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard. Compared with the domestic Akihabara bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. Look for the low price line in the future!
Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I can't cancel the order. The webpage contact online customer service always shows the wrong link, and I can't get in touch.
After the delivery arrived, the delivery guy called me, and I said I don't want it anymore, but if I wanted to cancel the order, the delivery guy took it back, and said to sign for me first, and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was told that once the food is signed for, it cannot be returned, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service. The same is true, and the sign cannot be returned.
I have bought items from JD.com and Suning that cannot be returned under the policy, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted the customer service and they were refunded, and JD.com's diapers were too smelly after opening. I contacted the customer service and they still returned it. You can't do it when you reach Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me that I can either accept it myself, or let the courier buy it by himself. It is not easy for the courier, so why should I let the courier pay for something that I didn't buy?
Okay, I will not refund, I accept it myself, but I have to give 1 point to your service
Advise everyone not to waste money
First of all, I am looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand should not be too bad. After receiving it, I think the packaging is okay, and the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft, which cannot be seen from the outside., to feel, tasteless in the mouth after eating, bland and tasteless, the flesh around the bite is dark yellow, that is the kind that is broken, good and bad are sold together, and less than one third of it can be eaten, advise everyone not to buy, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Gain wisdom by eating a pit, and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark
The corner of the bottom of the bottle is severely dented, which should be caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of ravages is worrying. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it is still purchased internationally. Have you seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs? It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the cap comes out directly. There is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are all foreign products like this?
Being born in China, I don't understand.
It should be authentic, right?
There is also a notification that it will arrive on the 20th when I took the photo. This one was received on the 14th. This is my first overseas purchase here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?
Pickup service could be improved
I bought a total of 5 delivery coupons. When I picked them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 coupons for the first time, but only 2 coupons were sent. After many communications, it was confirmed that they were missed and they needed to be reissued after I agreed. The second appointment was just in time. On the rest day, neither the website nor WeChat indicated the need to make an appointment on weekdays, which caused unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.
good shopping
Good stuff!
I still believe in Amazon's self-operated products. Now it's very convenient to buy overseas, and the delivery time is only a few days longer than domestic ones. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance capabilities for overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is faster than transshipment. Much faster, so many things are now purchased overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to buy them when you go out and buy them back home. I hope to improve.
Rubbish
Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: Do you think it is rubbish on the side of the road?
A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is like packing garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was extremely simple. There was no measure to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. When I got it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were also damaged.
If I only come across one like this, I will recognize it and buy a few that are like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and the customer service said that it can be refunded, but the shipping fee will be paid in advance, and then the shipping fee will be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card back. This means that I want to buy your gift card by myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse. This is not a crime for buying a product!
And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say a word is their responsibility, and dare not even take responsibility for a half sentence. What kind of guarantee is there for such after-sales service? Planted! But I guess my evaluation, Amazon will not give a chance to publish it, so I will delete it directly!
The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics is very poor
1. The quality is very good, the price is moderate, and the price is excellent.
2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. The logistics is flawed. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon didn't mark the expected delivery date as February 7th, I might be very satisfied.
5. But marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user will feel very uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure of making a promise, don't make a promise.
7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by merchants.
8, so, I scored low.
gold thread fades
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious or not depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not so good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade. If you put it on the car, if you move it a few times, there will be some gold dust in your hands and on the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square shape has no decorative effect, so don't put gold wires on it, it will be troublesome if it falls off and stains the car.
The items are in good condition and the speed is OK. They are divided into 2 packages and packaged differently.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is divided into 2 packages for 2 pieces, and the packaging is not the same. Obviously, one is too shockproof. It is stuck with thick cardboard and sealed with a layer of plastic. The outer packaging is also easy to disassemble. The other is domestic. It is like a courier box. It is okay to put a few cushioning airbags, which feels a bit perfunctory.
Airland mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is not so thick, you can just sleep on the mattress without the bed.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two spots of stains due to violent express delivery. Airland customer service was very responsible and contacted and solved the problem efficiently.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless
The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for the after-sales. If there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return the product, you have successfully applied for a return on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the product yourself.
What kind of self-operated product is this damn.
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for the after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier" and claimed that it is self-operated. It is shameless, shameless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!
Depressed experience
The filter element I bought online from another store before has a good filtering effect. After 28 days, I use it for an extra day or two and there is no scale.
Since the quality of the things purchased on Amazon has been good, this time I thought about buying here. It is the first time to buy a filter element on Amazon. It feels not very good. Not only does it start to have scale early, but also the filter element will have small black toner suspended until the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away, very depressed~
not as good as expected
Compared with the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, and the internals have not been disassembled. I hope it is as described by the store. From the perspective of ease of use, there is no indication of whether each independent unit is powered on.
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is seriously damaged, and the box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new. It was only renovated in September, and the stock is in stock. I hope it will not be broken by then. Please explain why several customers mentioned it. The packaging is damaged, but you can deal with it safely, thank you!
Overall good, a little problem
This is the first time I bought a water filter jug. After reading a few reviews, I felt that LAICA was more cost-effective, so I chose this one. I received the product and installed the filter element according to the instructions. I tried it, and it feels generally good, but it seems that the raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the raw water tank is not tightly sealed).
When using, be sure to wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
incomplete picture
The picture does not show the details of the side. The details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body. There is a big difference. This is one. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of the place of origin. This is the second. There is no indication of the texture. This is the third. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads. How could I judge whether it was true or not.
Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
I placed an order two days ago, and when I received it today, I found that the price was reduced by 40 yuan. It took me a lot of time to find the customer service, but the customer service said that I could not make up the difference, and I could re-buy and return the product.
This kind of customer experience and service is really 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure.
It's okay, as a novice, it's worth starting
The quality is decent, not comparable to the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong, and it's okay.
something good
The item is really good, I gave it to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not in Canada at noon to get the express delivery. The logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send me a verification text message for picking up the package, which caused me to run twice.
But baby is really good.
worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and Amazon offers great discounts. The official website of Chow Sang Sang ships the goods directly. I placed the order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. It's really fast.
Postal couriers are also responsible.
Thumbs up!
A customer's confession
1 If you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that this problem will be dealt with by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You will never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, you don't know her job number, and there is no direct contact phone number, that is, you can't contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, the commissioner contacted me. I left my mobile phone for a while, but did not receive a call from the commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours but did not get a call from the specialist. During this period, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the defective coffee machine I received!
5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the United States. The shopping method of overseas shopping is good, but the service compared to the United States and Asia is far worse.
6 For me I just have to keep waiting...
Uneven bottom
Because the comments are very good, everyone is looking forward to this pot. I like it very much when I got it. It is very light, but when I opened the pot, I found a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle is protrusive, the periphery is sunken, and the oil has gone to the periphery. The specially bought large fat meat in a pot is fried so much oil that it can't cover the central area.
I don't know if I was unlucky and just got a pot with a bad foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot clean and returned it, and I was busy for a long time in vain.
Good product design needs matching manufacturing process to realize
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer turned the top into a slightly curved surface.
It should have been very smooth lines.
It's a pity that the final effect was not realized.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the rear water tank top cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and there is a height difference of up to 2mm after the combination.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the entire sense of design has been destroyed.
I feel sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet able to create products of this level.
(Of course, I can't ask too much for the feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales said that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has problems, her disapproval and truthful emotions made me understand that you can't ask too much for Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small. It has been repaired for the second time, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
Good deal after discount, sad for Amazon fake discount
Purchased a week after the baby was born, the insulation is super strong.
There is no trace of heat on the outside of the pot, even if you are not afraid of being scalded, it can effectively protect the temperature from escaping.
The air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature after a night.
Amazon said that there are 320 big discounts for the anniversary event. Later, I found that everyone had 249, 289, 299. I felt cheated instantly, but I went to the supermarket and compared it. It is still much more cost-effective than various miscellaneous brands at the same price. You can take it with you when you go out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting and watching for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 is discounted, and Central Asia overseas purchases are at the same price, so hurry up.
I placed an order on September 2, and it was expected to arrive on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, and the speed is really fast!
The packing box is not big, and the original packaging of Vitamix is directly used, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking it when it is thrown across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new, with complete accessories, but the cup shakes so badly on the base that I am afraid that the cup will fly out when the machine is turned on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I can't find a Chinese version on the Internet, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. It is estimated that it will arrive in 3 days, and then I will toss it!
Too small, no umbrella cover, and the material is average.
Not a queen size at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one does not have an umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. It is clearly written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is probably not enough for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without any pressure.
not feeling well
The first is that the box is not very strong, and it will be deformed when you press it. The second is that the rear design prevents the ABS on the box from scratching when it is placed flat.. Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a bit not smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
Well enough
Advantages: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it can be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the buyer, can not be described as service-oriented.
The overall is not bad, I don't know if it is genuine leather
The overall feeling is not bad. I don't know whether it is genuine leather, so I can't make a blind evaluation.
It can hold A4-sized documents, even those with a thickness of more than 80 pages, but it may not be able to hold a box-shaped object that is too thick and hard (not deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag partition is more user-friendly, which is quite good.
It's just that there is a small trachoma on the bottom of the one I got. I don't know if it's my bad character or?
Too lazy to toss back and forth to exchange goods, bear it.
Overall, four stars are worth it.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world Camera Strap SLR Strap
This strap is designed more scientifically, hanging on the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft material, unlike other fast gunners who use screws to fix the bottom to hurt the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after sale
The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me an after-sales phone number. After many communications, the part has not been received yet. What kind of efficiency is this?
It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair if there is a problem in the future. Friends who are looking forward to the after-sales service should make a detour, it is too much trouble!
Minor flaws, good sound
The headstock is defective, a corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
It's okay, the first face sheet
It has been used for a long time, except that the bass is not coming out, the overall is not bad.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as expected.
When I bought it for the first time, something was wrong, all the lights were blinking, and it didn't work.
I asked for a replacement, but it took three days for the goods to arrive in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.
Calls to the delivery person are not answered.
The courier company said they only had that contact.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
I didn't ask for it, and in the case of delayed delivery, I somehow delayed the delivery according to my request - such a text message came.
Later, I will talk about the transit problem.
Anyway, the extremely poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
Probably won't get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered; and the label is very sticky, it is not good for cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off. Friends who buy it to organize cables should pay attention.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a cardboard box, without any protection measures, and the pen box is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is all on the box when it is torn off.
The six hundred yuan thing is treated like this, a very disappointing shopping.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve on the packaging in the future!
The quality is not good. If it is about writing, it is not as good as 925-25
Let's praise Tiantian Express first, the air mail is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, which is very good. I just received 925-85. The quality of the pen is excellent, and the style is also very beautiful. The reason why I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The cap adjusts the lead length. The place is a bit wobbly. Personal opinion: 925-25 is smoother than 85.
So become a diehard Amazon fan
I bought it at a super discounted price, but the child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been unpacked, and I tried to apply for a return, and it was picked up for free.
Too good.
Returns are not advocated, but such a service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
All future books will be moved to here to buy.
Headphones are skewed and there are noises
This headset is really rubbish, I don't know if there is something wrong with my ears, or this headset is really not as good as before.
I bought a blue one from Xyiyiyi two years ago. The sound quality is not bad, there is no noise and the bass is also good. After using it for more than two years, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
I also saw a purple one, which was pretty good-looking, but I bought this one and opened it today, and I felt something was wrong.
At first I thought it was the sound effect of the song and didn't think much about it, but after listening to it for a long time, I realized that the problem was very serious. Not only the pitch deviation, but also the bass effect was not as good as my previous one. There was also some noise. Is this phenomenon only in the purple one I bought? Or is the manufacturing process of earphones really not working now?
Pretty poor rating, very disappointed.
It must be returned during the day tomorrow.
PS looks good
This AV power amplifier has complicated settings, rough appearance and high heat generation.
The sound will take a while to comment!
I just bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14. I saw that the workmanship is poor.
1. The front panel and the knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input socket on the rear panel and the speaker output terminal are very poor. Just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine, which is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer was sunken. I had to unpack it and restore it by hand. The combination of the top cover and the front panel was loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased toward the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like an entry-level machine from SONY, just made in Malaysia.
I feel that it is much better for Sony to be an OEM in China than Xiaoma.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat. The two-channel movie is used for about 2 hours, and the top cover is 40-50°C when you touch it with your hands. I don't know if the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switching power supplies are mostly used. This stupid big transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony should use a silent fan that actively dissipates heat in the machine. After opening the box, only the large aluminum heat sink on the tube can be seen.

never opened
The battery is active.
I really want to dissect it and see what is in its stomach.
Thinking about it later, if you are disappointed after dismantling it, it would be too unfair to spend so much money; if you are satisfied after dismantling it, it will be difficult to reassemble it, and it will be uncomfortable to use.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of the power, most people will feel guilty when they look at it.
Fortunately, I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can be regarded as half a battery engineer, and I can stand it.
Overjoyed
Before I bought it, I was really unsure, until I opened the package and I felt very positive!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, it felt very flexible and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open qq music.
I was shocked, the sound quality turned out to be surround 3D!
I asked in the physical communication store, about 30 or so, but it is definitely not the Pinsheng brand, it is a miscellaneous brand, so although this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, it is absolutely worth having for the price!
worst online shopping experience
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but the goods were not received until October 12.
Check the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide the express tracking number, so I can't find out where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if I could provide the express tracking number, but there was no reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service. The customer service told the seller's mobile phone number. I called the store again.
Although I was very angry, but because the computer was urgently needed, I didn't tell the seller much, just send it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said not yet, it will be shipped in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said that it would be shipped after five or six in the afternoon, but when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said he didn't send it, and told me that if I was in a hurry, let me order from another store, and if I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
No way, it takes a long time to place an order from another store.
Just ask the seller to ship it quickly.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, I'll add comments later.
I just bought it for half a year and haven't used it a few times, and now it has a bad contact. Can I have it repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it a few times since I bought it.
I just carry it in my business bag and use it a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power was turned on, it was not charging. It was necessary to hold the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hands to charge it.
It is suspected that the interface is poorly connected. I wonder if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon disable EMS!
Five-star product, one-star logistics, average three-star.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS. It is recognized in the industry as unreliable. Well, computers are valuables anyway!
After buying, the order shows that it is expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send it from Xiamen to Fuzhou!
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. As a result, I checked the logistics at night without receiving any calls or text messages.
I was instantly shocked!
Who I am? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
It's almost doubtful that life is alive!
Finally, I went to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two tracking numbers, but fortunately the item is not lost.
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to send express in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I just bought it a few days ago and found that the price has been reduced. Bad reviews, the book is not bad, and the price is high. The cpu and graphics card are enough for mainstream online games and quite a few large single machines. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light leaking (ips screen common problems), the audio quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to test the hardware, there is no problem, the built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller delivered the goods quickly, and answered all inquiries very quickly. The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer. Not bad, but unfortunately there are no gifts.
(By the way, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure to buy keyboard film. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there is a problem with the product, it will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is full of bad words. Let me expose it)
Things are good, platform bureaucracy remains
The quality of the hard disk is very good, and the price/performance ratio is absolutely high. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry and can bear the logistics, it is definitely recommended to buy.
But what I have to say is that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. It has not improved from when I swore I would never use it a few years ago. You will never find out the actual logistics status. The information will always be delivered after a few weeks, and you can never complain. That's it. bureaucracy!
It has been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days later, you will receive the goods!
Logistics worry
When it was delivered like this, not only the packaging was flattened, but also the packaging of electrical appliances was opened. I don't know if there is any package change.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I checked online, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, how long will it last?
Bought someone else disassembled
The tax of more than 100 for a machine of more than 300 is indeed relatively high. It seems that it is more balanced now that it is more than 600.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape was very wrong, as if it had been disassembled, so I quickly took a photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as it was torn off. After opening, the cardboard inside was still damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. On the anniversary day, I hurriedly tried it on my husband, but the machine didn't have any electricity at all. Fortunately, there is no beard stubble in the cutter head, otherwise I will return it all the way!
It is unknown whether it will be easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. Like the previous evaluation, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable!
Moderate to upper level of experience
It is almost a top-level electric, and there are many cleaning modes, but few people will change their brushes in different modes every day.
I have used it for half a year without any problems. I brush it every day, and flush it on Monday for more than one week.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, other seemingly compatible issues are the reasons for the overseas version?
I hope to learn Dafa.
very cost-effective
Have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and easy to clean.
3. It is completely possible to DIY haircut and save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
The last time I bought two packs, there were actually two different versions. Originally, the words on the lower left corner of the pack were green, but it turned out that one pack was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got diarrhea after eating it.
I am not sure whether Amazon's source of goods is fake, or it was replaced by an employee during delivery.
I will buy it again, if it is still a fake, I will find you relevant people to hold it accountable.
It's horizontal!
There are slashes on the Amazon picture, but the result is a horizontal slash, isn't that a lie?
The effect is okay
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind the instep.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Addition: Today, I compared the previous UN series insoles (throw away the shoes and keep the insoles), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is fake and soft.
2. The instep of my instep is not too high, and the cruciate part is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of the instep.
3. I bought three pairs of clarks overseas, and only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my favorites.
Go back and try rockport, if not, you can only go to the ecco physical store.
Shoddy, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that the Prime overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful, and the order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, and 7.5W. The upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One sole has damaged rubber, and the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the upper. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced.
I regret it a little!
I bought it for 280 yuan for the event. It is quite a bargain to buy ASICS at this price. Of course, there are lower prices in the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well without being baggy.
The appearance is very good, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, but this time I bought 40.5 shoes, and there is about a thumb's distance from the front of the shoes, but this does not affect anything.
This shoe is very "narrow," although there is still a distance in the front, it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be well ventilated, and it feels hot to wear now.
Press the instep
First of all, the workmanship of the shoes is very good, and it is worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have also bought a few pairs of Amazon's love step, and there has never been a problem, but this pair I refer to the reviews and buy a freshman size uk7, the length of the upper foot is obviously longer because it is one size larger, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the instep very hard, and the hiking shoes are very hard, which makes the upper foot very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you have to buy it, you can change the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, so it's a pity not to use it.
A very perfect shopping!
I am very satisfied and like it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine products, and the quality is also very good. It is of high quality and low price. You can rest assured that you can buy it. The after-sales service is very thoughtful. The customer service attitude is very kind and kind. It handles problems patiently and efficiently. The supporting express delivery is very convenient and safe. The delivery master is very considerate of customers. Every time, he will remind you to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
All in all, our whole family likes shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it's been a long time, I still have to complain.
I bought it in a spike in winter, less than 200, and it is useless to keep it at home for a few months.
When I was going to use it in the spring, I found that I couldn't connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals expressed their support for each other. Later, I found out that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I still couldn't connect to other devices.
I called Amazon and asked me to contact the agency, and the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back intact, even the express box was the one I used to send it over!
There is no reply, receipt or test report!
Anyway, tell me whether it is good or bad!
I called to ask, and said that sending it back in this way means that there is no problem with the equipment, which is good.
But why I still can't connect, the agency replied: That's not their business.
I'm unlucky. I'm too lazy to be tossed by you for a 200 yuan thing.
Seriously wrong.
Very out of stock.
The headband material is good.
Much better than nike.
Breathability is also very good.
Just the cap on the front.
very fine.
Are you here for a joke?!
Completely out of the sun.
No returns because it functions well as a headband.
Although it can't cover the sun if it is worn upwards.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Save it.
The quality of the product is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of the contract, and the delivery guy is very good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's regulations cannot deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
It made me drive 200 kilometers from other places to come back to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery guy was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
Product, just tried it, it's not bad.
But I haven't bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is not bad, but the logistics is too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL. This time Apex is really... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low. I feel that the grade is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?
In fact, they are all the same, so overseas shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall and 68KG. My shoulder width is usually 180. I bought M, and the hem is slightly longer. Others fit well. I see that S size is recommended. Are you so slender? Still like tight fit? I think the hoodies should be looser.
Just the right size
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before buying and was told that I should buy the xxl one, and then I read the reviews and decided to buy the L one. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost cheated.
The price of Double Eleven is much more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z affordable product problem is troublesome!
The order was placed on the 18th, and the goods were received on the 25th. The speed from Guangzhou to Beijing is a snail!
I bought the most affordable product, and it was told in the description that there were scratches, but after receiving the product, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child was unwilling to return the product, thinking it was not a big problem, but the child's grandfather ran to several nearby hardware stores and couldn't buy such small parts as accessories!
Finally, grandpa glued it on!
It seems that I will not be able to buy the most affordable products in the future!
Toy processing quality is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, and it is very laborious to install the bolts. It can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long it can be played, because it is something promised to the child, so it will not be returned.
Other reviews said it was easy to install, so is this the only one I bought that has a problem?
very average
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is too old; the workmanship is very ordinary; there is only one kind of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just shaking your head and walking forward without any change.
Not worth the price.
Urgent use, no return.
The quality of the toy is good, let me complain about the packaging
I received the courier yesterday. I bought it from Amazon. It was marked as EMS delivery. In the end, it was delivered by Tmall's courier. How many turns did it take? Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Let's talk about the packaging again. It's just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers. There's not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good and there are no broken parts. It's much smaller than imagined, because it is not equipped with a battery, and it often derails when pushing it by hand. It feels that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the design is unreasonable.
good quality and fun
It is very fun, the components are of high precision, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to that of Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembling is very interesting. I will do it, and my 5-year-old son will come to play. It is very good.
He was amazed and laughed again and again ~ he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good
I checked it out for Christmas. The one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a little slower now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect the poke ball, you will send a dream.
Playing well, it is more portable than ps4.
Already bought Zelda, waiting for the game to try again.
Production of bad goods, sale of bad goods, the result of bad goods service, bought six watches to give to the children, one of them showed incomplete numbers, and the time of the six watches was not consistent, with a difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a checking time for the watch when it is put into storage? They replied "yes." If there is, why is there such a big time difference? It must be that the watch has no precision. Simply put, it is a water product. It is not what I said. Look, the obvious quality problems (the numbers are not completely displayed) are all sold out. Are they rubbish?
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and complained that they should not have bought their products at the beginning. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
In short, I suggest not to buy things from this seller, it is also rubbish.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, inspection found:
1. The watch packaging is seriously worn out.
2. The instruction manual of the watch has serious use wrinkles.
3. The watch does not run, and the desk lamp is not used for charging, so the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, and the postage will be paid later.
5. The reason for 2 points is that the customer service service is not bad.
just passable
The time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day, and it has been more than two minutes after only a few months of use.
I have used a piece of West Rail City before, and I feel that it will not be a few seconds behind in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is a bit tasteless, and it is basically not used. Occasionally, it will enter the timing mode by mistake.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not need to worry about replacing the battery, it has world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easy to scratch and get dust.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, and it can be purchased overseas for more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
very satisfied watch
It must be authentic. I went to the counter to inspect the goods. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, and it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. Those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches cannot be compared. This one is genuine.
The time of the watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the packaging of the watch, and there is a real diamond on the 12 number on the dial.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the night of September 23rd, my wife dropped her mobile phone. On a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock, but it was not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since the non-self-operated delivery is relatively slow, the system shows that it is expected to be the latest delivery until September 27th.
My wife was so uncomfortable without a mobile phone. The next morning at 6:00 a.m., I was asked to think about a solution. Later, I went to Jingdong and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered on the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying a new one, I thought about canceling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called the customer service after 7 o'clock and asked to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it has been canceled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I just waited patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status and had not been delivered. I immediately contacted the customer service and asked to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3:00 p.m., I checked the order on my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact the customer service again to make it clear that it was the third call. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to deliver the goods!

Hao Ren looked down at the last one, and after two seconds, he also rubbed it into a ball and threw it into the same place, while reflecting on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago - the public transportation company recruits an office clerk, 25 to 40 years old, hard-working, computer-savvy and work experience is preferred, gender female.
He came to the city center with this thing in his hands, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising company that was busy recruiting workers two days before it closed down were, and he was almost full of food.
Hao Ren, gender male, loves women, age 25, no ** hobbies, the advantage is not picky food, currently single, few relatives and friends, he lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city south of the city, like most young men, his life goal is to earn more than 10,000 a month at the age of 25, marry a beautiful daughter-in-law, if you can have a car, parents are not able to be filial, so at least he has to live well enough to not be humiliating to the family, now this series of life goals has completed a third: he is 25 years old.
It's a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but in fact he has no urgent need for a source of livelihood: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents, and should be grateful for the family business left by the older generation, at least the house is quite large - it is a two-storey old-fashioned house, which has been changed into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been renting a house to make a living, but because he lives in a remote place, even remote enough to wait for the demolition of the old house may have to plan for several decades.
To be fair, Hao Ren has such a stable income that he doesn't need to come out to look for a job, but this person, the leisure time is too long is a bit sentimental, always feel that he should make a little effort to explore the road of life, plus the more important reason - his old house is too far away, to the extent that it is almost out of human civilization, since the last migrant couple moved out of the rental house, no one has come to rent a house for half a year, looking at the empty two-storey "apartment" for several months in a row, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart: unless the municipal planning is tilted towards him, I'm afraid that he can really live.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought it was unlikely that the area around his home would become a commercial center overnight, and considering that as an old man he could not waste himself, he finally decided to find a job first, at least to have an income to support himself.
How can I say that I was also a good and industrious man who worked to earn tuition fees, and I could starve myself to death?
However, fate does not depend on the will of the person, he ran blindly outside the first day basically... only left to run blindly.
It was no use thinking so much, so Hao Ren stretched himself and decided to rest under a tree-shaded bench in a small park by the roadside, and after the hottest hour of noon, he would go to a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then take a bus home.
Even though the economy is developing fast, the place can still keep a little bit of leisure and light. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down, covered his face with the folding page with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl to block the sun, and rested indifferently.
However, just as he lay down for what seemed to be less than a minute, the sunlight pouring in through the edge of the folding page dimmed, as if someone had come to him. Hao Ren accidentally showed his face and was stunned to find that the sky was already setting, and a small and thin female figure was standing next to him, which just covered the sinking sun, because the woman's appearance could not be seen clearly against the light, and he could only confirm that she was a slim girl with short hair through a dim outline.
"Are you awake?"
At this point, the strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position against the light made her indistinct, so she grinned and turned slightly so that the other person could see her.
A very beautiful girl - this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This self-acquainted girl has short hair with a shawl, maybe she likes sports, her skin is a little bit of wheat color, healthy and full of sunshine, her appearance is beautiful, the most noticeable is the pair of big and dynamic eyes, more vibrant than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has seen, as if the whole person's spirit will be revealed from these eyes.
Behind her was a large suitcase that looked weighty.
Looking at Hao Ren a little stunned, the beautiful girl with short hair blossomed an unprecedented bright giggle (although it seems a bit inappropriate to say so, but Hao Ren did think it was a giggle), the smile was clean and pure, now it seems that few girls of the same age can see the face, the other party in the small bag with him for half a day, finally took out a piece of crumpled paper to hand to Hao Ren: "Excuse me, do you know where this place is? "
Hao Ren patted his face to make himself wake up, regardless of what was going on with this reckless girl, but looked down at the address on the paper...
Part 1, Chapter 1
The early morning twilight pierced the ink-blue sky, the sky was vast, and the belly of the fish was white.
Xianyu County, Wuzong University, in the back mountain forest, a thin teenager wearing loose martial arts robes, double-disc squat, the tip of the tongue against the teeth, the whole body concentrated on the left and right two fists, hitting a thick tree.
The boxing is smooth, easy to put and put, the inner strength is contained without spitting, the rigidity is soft, has a certain fire.
The young man named Su Yu was fourteen years old, beautiful and handsome, with a straight posture and still childish.
Black hair flutters lightly, a pair of eyes as vast as the stars, as deep as the ancient starry sky, showing wisdom that does not match the age.
Three hours later, the sun was high.
Su Yu stopped boxing, looked down at the blood-stained fists, and sighed, "I work twice as hard as others, but the effect I get is not half that of the better qualified. "
"I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse to come to another world?"
Two months ago, Su Yu was in a plane crash, and when he woke up, he found himself crossing into a world called the Moon Land.
Become a student of a Wuzong university in the mainland.
It took him two months to digest the memory of his original master.
The land of the moon, honoring the martial arts, the law of the weak, cruel and severe.
Human beings cultivate martial arts, reach the peak of the extreme, and reach the state of the extraordinary into the holy.
Martial arts is divided into nine levels, each of which has three levels: Xiaocheng, Dacheng, and Peak.
Beyond the nine-fold martial arts, break the shackles, become a god, become a mythical figure, known as the "holy king of the world."
The realm of the holy king on earth is the ultimate of martial arts and the limit of the pursuit of millions of human beings.
Rumor has it that the holy king of the world can move mountains and fill the sea, lift clouds and drive fog, omnipotent.
A holy king on earth is enough to change the fortunes of a dynasty for a hundred years, and is a God-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to cultivate in the world?
Su Yu is the supreme genius of Qingshan Town under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At the age of 14, he cultivated to the peak of martial arts and became a century-old prodigy in the minds of all people in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was recruited by the Wuzong University in Xianyu County, which was above everything else, Su Yu discovered what a frog he had been.
Wuzong University, search for all the talents of Xianyu County, once a year.
And he was only the bottom of all the talents in Wuzong University!
Wuzong University divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden cadets, talents of outstanding levels, are often the best in a city, and the top talents who suppress the rest of the talents in the city will be trained by Wuzong University.
Silver cadet, talented at the level of potential, in a small town, has a superior talent, with a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver student, and he understands very well that in fact, silver students are the kind of people who have no hope of cultivating to great success, but it's a pity to give up.
Silver students are not favored, and the cultivation resources given by universities are very limited, and the possibility of getting ahead is approaching zero.
"Su Yu, go back to the university, the Duke of Qin summons you!" An urgent voice cut through the silence of the mountain forest, a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain out of breath, his face a little anxious.
"Can you neglect the prince of the State of Qin? Come with me!" The middle-aged blue coat was impatient, and buckled Su Yu's shoulders, ignoring the pain of Su Yu's thin body, grasped him quickly down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted his teeth and endured a sharp pain in his shoulder, silent.
The middle-aged man in blue is a university deacon who manages daily student activities and, in the words of the Earth School, is the teaching director.
After half a tea.
University, a luxurious and elegant, exquisite as a dream lounge.
Only core students, senior university officials, and dignitaries can rest here, and other than that, gold students and silver students are not qualified.
Su Yu also came to the luxury lounge for the first time, and ordinary poor boys may be nervous when they come here. But Su Yu, who was a business elite in his past life, was a regular guest in a five-star hotel, presidential suite, and luxury ball, and was calm and flattered.
In the lounge, there were three people, a young man and a young woman, and a noble and dignified man.
As she glanced at the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu's eyes paused.
She was a woman with a beautiful face like a fairy, her jade appearance was as delicate as a carving, her skin was as white as the snow of Yangchun, her figure was exquisite, and she was dressed in spotless white clothes, just like a fox fairy, very beautiful.
However, she looked at Su Yu's eyes, there was a cold, but also a little complicated.
Beside him was a sixteen-year-old boy, handsome, handsome, and indescribable.
"Hehe, I'm the prince of the State of Qin, I'm happy to see you." The prince of the State of Qin, one of the three great princes of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, there was no haughtiness, but was very kind, and asked Su Yu to sit down with a smile.
Su Yu shook his head coldly in his heart, unmoved by his kindness.
People in high positions have attracted the attention of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and self-image.
Just like the politicians on Earth, they were clearly at odds with each other, but after the meeting, they still shook hands and greeted each other with a smile on their face, only stabbing under the stage and throwing black hands.
"I'm Qin Feng's father, and I'm here for him and Qing'er. "The prince of the State of Qin has a handsome face and a warm smile. "I've heard Feng'er say everything, and I apologize to you as Feng'er's father."
Su Yu's bitterness flashed in his heart, and it was the bitterness of another Su Yu's soul. The girl in front of him, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu, and was also included as a student of Wuzong University.
Two young people, two little ones without guessing, a golden child and a jade girl, a pair made in heaven.
However, after entering Wuzong University, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small village and town, was shocked by the huge and prosperous world and gradually became intoxicated with the world of glitz.
With her fairy-like beauty, she is unavoidably sought after by young dignitaries and handsome talents.
Initially, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and spend her first year with Su Yu.
However, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, from a naive little girl, gradually metamorphosed, knowing that Su Yu is difficult to have a future, with her, it is likely to suffer, become a subordinate.
Finally, her inner defenses fell apart.
Two months ago, he completely broke off contact with Su Yu and became the son of the prince of Qin and the partner of the prince of Xiaoguo, Qin Feng.
Although Jiang Xueqing adhered to her duty as a girl of a good family and never encroached on the relationship between men and women, since then, the two have often accompanied each other, inseparable, become the envy of everyone's fairy couple.
Su Yu, on the other hand, became the laughing stock of Wuzong University.
Su Yu was devastated and repeatedly begged Jiang Xueqing to change his mind, begging on his knees and losing face, but Jiang Xueqing coldly refused.
Unable to bear the sadness of life, Su Yu threw himself into a lake and killed himself. Coincidentally, Su Yu of Earth had an air crash, and his soul passed through him as a sad and pitiful weak person.
When the State of Qin saw that Su Yu was lost in remembrance, he could not give up his friendship for Jiang Xueqing, sighing, "Feng Er is young and ignorant, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what you want, just mention, but as a father, I hope you can succeed Feng Er, he is serious about Xueqing girl."
Listening to the words of the Duke of Qin, which seemed to come from the heart, Su Yu secretly shook his head in his heart, this trick can deceive ordinary people, it is useless to him.
He robbed my girlfriend and let me fulfill it? Where is this apology? It's clearly pressure!
The Duke of Qin appeared to be mild-mannered, but in fact he was full of naked insults.
I would like to ask, if it's the king's woman, the emperor's woman, and his son likes it, would he dare to let the king give up his woman to Qin Feng? He dare not, because he can't offend the king, he can only offend a commoner like Su Yu!
Su Yu gently shook his head and stood up to leave. He had no no nostalgia for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing, and even if the King of Qin did not exert pressure, he did not plan to fight for her.
As for the so-called compensation of the Duke of Qin, although Su Yu lacked resources for cultivation, although he was a poor boy, although he had nothing. However, he still had an unyielding will, and he was not reduced to the point of being given charity.
Jiang Xueqing understands "Su Yu" character, stubborn and unyielding, see him want to leave, only when he still refuses to give up, silver teeth gently bite, lotus step lightly, snow eyes like the cold moon: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!"
"Since today, I'll say it thoroughly, I hope you can give up. "Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed cold.
"Qin Fenggui is a small prince, will be the backbone of the empire, he can give me glory and wealth, you are a poor boy in a mountain village, can you give me? "
"Qin Fengzun as a golden student, will chase the holy king of the world, standing on top of billions of people, can give me a sense of security, you introduce a silver student, can you give it? "
"Su Yu, accept the reality, I do not deny that you were my love, the most dazzling genius in my mind, but that is I am too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and real, I have no choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in his eyes, stared at Su Yu's eyes, gradually far away, as if looking at a stranger, gently sighed: "Feng Ge people are very nice, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try to compensate you, give you a few Rong Ling Bao Dan, promote cultivation, your strength improves, your life in school will be much better."
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a fairy, so infatuated.
The statue of a woman is lifelike, just like the owner holding it, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the gift you gave me, and now, I'll give it back to you, and we'll never owe each other." Jiang Xueqing ruthlessly put the statue in Su Yu's hand, turned back to Qin Feng's side, looked out of the sky, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and unfeeling.
"Chi Yao, I treat you like a dear love, why did you kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared, wanted to jump forward, pressed the gilded cast bed "squeaking" and suddenly sat up.
When he found it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen breathed out and wiped the sweat on his brow with his sleeve.
No, I don't!
It was not a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was the only son of the "Ming Emperor," one of the nine emperors of Kunlun, and at the age of sixteen, he cultivated to the fullness of the celestial world with a physique that defied the heavens.
However, just as he was becoming the first person of the young generation in Kunlun, he died at the hands of his fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao was the daughter of the Qing Emperor, one of the nine emperors.
The Ming Emperor and the Qing Emperor were the best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao were married by their bellies, growing up together and cultivating together.
A heroic and valiant, a beautiful, can be called a golden girl, could have been a good story in the field of cultivation. Zhang Ruochen could not have expected that the princess Chi Yao would shoot him!
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, Zhang Ruochen woke up again and found himself eight hundred years later.
The former princess Chi Yao put down the Rebellion of the Nine Emperors, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the empress of Chi Yao, the master of the whole Kunlun world.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors of Kunlun, who were the masters of Kunlun, completely became a thing of the past and disappeared in the long river of history.
The nine emperors are dead, and the empress is in office.
In this era, there was only one emperor, the Empress of Chi Yao, who ruled the world and ruled over all sides.
"Why did she kill me?
How could her heart be so hard, or is it that women's hearts are so hard? "Zhang Ruodu's eyes were sharp, his heart was as heavy as iron, and he was full of questions. But no one could help him answer.
Eight hundred years have passed, the vicissitudes of the sea have long been vicissitudes, things are wrong, except for the cultivation of the world-class Chi Yao empress, youth is still the same, not old and not dead.
All the old people have turned into loess and white bones. Even the Nine Emperors, who were all awe-inspiring, have all disappeared from the world, leaving only a piece of brilliant story for posterity to pass on for a long time.
"Squeak! "
A beautiful woman in frail palace dress, pushed the door in from the outside, looked at the dusty Zhang sitting on the bed, with a concerned look in her eyes, "Dust, you have a nightmare again? "
This beautiful woman is the princess of the King of Yunwu County, and also Zhang Ruochen's mother, Princess Lin.
The original owner of the body died on the bed three days ago because he was sickly.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the boy who had died of illness back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body was also called Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen first woke up, he was very repulsive to Linfei.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Linfei was just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually found that Linfei really cared about him, it was simply meticulous, saw Zhang Ruochen had a nightmare and was scared to wake up, despite the cold weather, immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room.
In his last life, Zhang Ruochen never saw his biological mother. It is said that she died when he was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by the princess Chi Yao, he was born again in this body, even let him have a mother, feel the warmth of mother's love. "Maybe she does not know, his dust, three days ago, died of illness!"
If you tell her the truth, she may not be able to bear the shock of the bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened and he smiled, "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream. "
Mrs. Lin, wearing a maroon hooded hood on her thin body, sat on the edge of her dusty bed, stroked her dusty brow, and worried, "It's been three nights, and you always wake up from nightmares, and every time you call her'Chi Yao'. Who is she? "
Naturally, Concubine Lin could not associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after the unification of the Kunlun border and the establishment of the First Central Empire, the Empress of Chi Yao was called the "Empress of the Great Wei De," and no one dared to mention the word "Chi Yao."
Will commit a taboo. Zhang Ruochen said, "Nothing, mother, you heard wrong! "
Concubine Lin sighed and said, "Never call the word'Chi Yao' again, even in a dream, it's the name of the Empress. Calling the name of the Empress is disrespectful, and if you hear it, you'll be killed. "
Zhang Ruochen nods his head, squeezes his fingers tightly, and says with deep meaning, "Absolutely not!"
I'll be her nightmare in the future.
Princess Lin looked at Zhang Ruodu, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, feeling incredibly sour.
Although he was born in the home of the county king, he was sickly from a young age, already sixteen years old, still can only lie in bed all year round, I'm afraid this life can only be like this!
Outside, there was a clutter of footsteps.
"What are you doing?
A beautiful-looking maidservant tried to stop the intruding Eight Princes, but was pushed lightly by the Eight Princes and fell more than ten meters away. The Eight Princes were a warrior who had reached the late stage of the Huangji Realm, and with one blow, a stone plate weighing three hundred jin could be struck ten feet away, not to mention a one-hundred-jin maidservant?
With a flick of your finger, you can bounce her off.
The maid screamed and fell heavily to the ground, breaking her left arm.
The Eight Prince was dressed in gold hazel, with a jade belt wrapped around his waist, a strong body, slender arms, and a steady pace. He walked into the Jade Palace and stared at the maidservant coldly, "A slave and maidservant dare to block the way of the prince, it's really death. "
Behind the Eight Princes, there were six bodyguards in black leather armor, tall and bear-backed, apparently powerful martial arts monks, who belonged to the guards of the royal palace.
When she heard what was going on outside, she calmed Zhang Ruochen's emotions and closed the door and went out.
She stared at the Eight Princes standing outside, frowned slightly, and said, "Your Royal Highness, this is the Jade Palace, even if you are a prince, you can't trespass! "
The Eighth Prince Zhang Ji looked up at Concubine Lin and said, "The Queen has an order, and the dormitories of Concubine Lin and his Nine Brothers will be changed to'Purple Yi Pian Hall'. In the future, the owner of the Jade Palace will be the Prince's biological mother, Princess Xiao's wife."
Princess Lin's face changed slightly. She had expected this day to come, but she didn't expect it to come so soon.
Concubine Lin smiled sadly and said, "Is the Queen going to drive our mother and son out of the Yuzhao Palace so soon?
My mother said that she would like to move into the Yuzhao Palace tonight. Please move to the Yuzhao Palace now! "
The Eighth Prince gave a cold smile and said unkindly, "Mrs. Lin, there are so many poor people in this world, but not everyone deserves pity. Since the Ninth Brother is sickly, what is he doing in the world? "
"He's your 9th brother!"
Mrs. Lin wanted to say something more, and suddenly the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hands on the doorpost, staring at the Eight Princes not far away.
He looked weak and windless, as if he had an unyielding will, saying, "Don't ask them, we'll move now. "
"Dust, how did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, and I don't want to go back soon. "Linfei rushed to help Zhang Ruochen, for fear that he would catch the wind cold.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes and seemed to be affected by his emotions, nodding her head with tears.
Concubine Lin and Shen, holding Zhang Ruochen, walked out of the Jade Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eight Princes and broke her arm.
None of the other servants left the Yuzhuo Palace with them. Everyone could see that the concubine Lin and the nine princes had completely lost their power, and there was no place for them in the county palace.
Originally, they were the servants of the Yuzhao Palace, but now they naturally and wisely chose to stay in the Yuzhao Palace, all to please the new master of the Eight Princes.
Ziyi Hall, generally the place where the out-of-favor princess lives, is very remote, full of leaves, it seems that it has not been inhabited for a long time.
The night is deep and the wind is cold and bleak.
Sitting on a cold stone bench, his thin body was wrapped in a coat, but he still felt cold.
"This body is too weak, and only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
If not, even if I am now the son of the county king, I can only be manipulated. "Zhang Ruochen thought in his heart.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen does not know where he can go now.
Since God has arranged for him to be reborn in this body, he must be strong whether he wants to take revenge on the Empress of Chi Yao in the future or for the mother who took good care of him. The humiliation and coldness he suffered today is all because he was too weak to resist and control his destiny, and even the place where he lived was taken over by others.
If you want to be respected by others and to have a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your ability.
In Kunlun, if you want to become a warrior, you must first open the "Shenwu Seal."
The so-called "seal of God's martial arts" is the qualification for cultivating martial arts given to mankind by the gods.
Those who have not opened the "Shenwu Seal" will never be able to cultivate true qi and become strong between the heavens and the earth. Zhang Ruochen is 16 years old, and still has not opened the "Shenwu Seal."
After the age of sixteen, you will miss the best age to practice martial arts, even if you open the "Shenwu Seal," it is unlikely to have much achievement.
They are also the sons of the King of Yunwu County, why can the Eight Princes be superior to others? Can they drive Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin out of the Yuzhao Palace?
It is because the Eight Princes started the "Shenwu Seal" when they were ten years old, and now they are young warriors in the late Huangji Realm.
"As long as I open the'Shenwu Seal', I can practice the Nine Days Ming Emperor Sutra.
With the mystical beauty of the Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra, even if I have missed the best cultivation age, I may still catch up with other talents and become a strong martial artist again." The Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra is the highest treasure of the Ming Emperor's cultivation, and only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra.
"Tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony, I hope to get the recognition of the gods, will open the "God's Seal". "
Zhang Ruochen tightened his fist, full of desire to open the "Shenwu Seal".
After cleaning up the room, she came to help Zhang Ruochen, "Dust, you have an early rest! Tomorrow, I will go to the sacrifice ceremony. "
"Mother rest assured, I will be able to open the "Shenwu Seal" tomorrow! "Zhang Ruochen said.
"Hmm!
Concubine Lin took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen and sighed in her heart.
Chapter 1
With a clatter, a rusty iron door was opened, and the sound of the iron door was blocked back by the surrounding old buildings, curling away.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out of the iron gate by two jailers, dragging his arms. The young man with a drooping head seemed to have no breath, and even his arms were so thin that only bones were left. The blood-stained rags on his body showed how the young man had been battered and tortured.
The thin man was thrown to the ground by two jailers, splashed with dust, and then did not move again.
"Is this boy supposed to be dead? "asked a stout jailer, staring at the young man who was motionless on the ground.
The other jailer said, "I think he's dead, and who dared to be rude to Miss Jane because he didn't know how to live. Now, not only is Ningfu destroyed, but he's also freed, and he deserves it. "
"Old man, be careful what you say, and we'll drag him out and deal with him first. "The stout jailer hastened to warn.
Hearing the short and fat jailer's words, the other jailer who called the old master shrank his head involuntarily, and was about to pull up the man who had no breath on the ground, ready to be dragged away.
At this moment, a weak voice shouted, "Two elder brothers, I want to take my husband away. "
The two talking jailers saw a woman in coarse cloth and sackcloth standing at the side. Although she was dressed in coarse cloth and sackcloth, she could still make out her good looks. The only pity was that her face was disfigured and covered by her slightly untidy hair, which made it difficult to look at her a second time.
The two jailers recognized who the woman was, and it was one of the only two surviving members of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the housekeeper of Ningfu, and when Ningfu was ransacked, he left the State of Cang and Qin to have something to do, so he escaped a disaster. The woman was the daughter-in-law of Ningfu, and the wife of the thin man who had just been thrown out of prison, called Ji Luofei.
She escaped the disaster because she stayed at the Cangqin Erxing College. Of course, this was also because Ji Luofei and the Ning family had little connection, and the reason why she married into the Ning family was because the Ning family and the Ji family were worldly friends, and she and Ningcheng were betrothed since childhood. However, the Ji family fell down in the most inexplicable way, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luofei.
Even so, Ningcheng's grandpa, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luofei into his house, and was ready to wait for Ningcheng to really gather strength before the two were married.
"All right, all right, drag it away, it's ugly to put it here, "the stout jailer said, putting away the silver coins and waving impatiently.
They were going to dispose of the body in Ningcheng, but they didn't expect that someone would come to deal with it and give them silver coins. Of course, they wouldn't refuse such a good thing.
When Ji Luofei heard this, she quickly carried Ningcheng on her back, speeded up, and soon disappeared from the prison door.
"If Ji Luofei is not disfigured, she is also a beautiful woman. "Looking at Ji Luofei's back, another jailer tossed the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
"Don't talk nonsense, at any rate, Ji Luofei is also a member of the Cangqin Second Star College, even if it is ugly, it will not be our turn. "The short and fat jailer patted the speaking jailer on the shoulder, pulling him into the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled a very nice fragrance, and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted that he was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance was coming from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembers that after being rejected by Tian Muxing, he was in a very bad mood. As a result, he took the wrong road and went up on the elevated platform alone. Then a yellow awn from the sky hit him, and then there was no more.
Does he mean he's not dead? What's the matter?
When Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, all kinds of information rushed into his mind, and he was born again.
To the shock of Ning Xiaocheng, his reborn body was originally called Ningcheng. He was shocked because his original name was Ningcheng.
It was only because he often had a nightmare that he saw himself come to a very strange place, was plotted to be put in prison, and then suffered and died. Although it was just a dream, Ningcheng changed its name to Ningxiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, he called Ningcheng, and was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat on his brow, but the woman carrying him looked back and didn't say much.
"I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk. "Seeing the woman looked back at herself, Ning Xiaocheng said apologetically.
"Ning's family is gone, you are lucky to be alive. "The woman's tone is calm, as if even if Ning Xiaocheng really died, she is such a calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng was silent, he had just sorted out some fragments of information. He should now call back to Ningcheng again, he is the only one of the Ning family of the State of Cang Qin.
Ningcheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to look for spirits when they were very young in Ningcheng, and never came back. Ningcheng has always lived with his grandpa Ning Hongchang in Cangle City, the capital of the Cang and Qin kingdoms.
Of course, Ningcheng also became the first person in Ningfu, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ningcheng. All the bad things that Ningcheng did in Cangle were carried down by Ning Hongchang. The city of Cangle was full of kings and nobles, and although Ning Hongchang was also the elder of the state of Cang and Qin, it was a little worse than those kings and nobles.
Finally, one day, Ningcheng offended a basket that even he couldn't bear. He even offended Jian Sujie, the apple of the eye of the Jian family in the State of Qin, not to say that the Jian family couldn't offend the Ning family, but even Jian Sujie's fiancé, Qiu Yingguang, couldn't offend the Ning family.
Ningcheng thought of this and sighed. The result he couldn't get was, of course, that he was put in prison. Grandpa Ning Hongchang used up his connections and family wealth in order to protect him, but instead of being protected, he took the whole Ning family in. The news was learned by his predecessor from the jailer, and it can be said that the Ning family was also because he was destroyed.
After Ningcheng cleared up these things, he sighed again in his heart, saying that there is no reason in this world, and whoever has a big fist is the reason.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was, and the disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luofei, who was similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family fell down for no reason, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luofei, but Ningcheng's grandpa, Ning Hongchang, took Ji Luofei to the Ning family and was ready to help them get married when Ningcheng was together.
Ning Hongchang condoned Ningcheng in other matters, but he never gave in to the matter of marrying Ji Luofei. The original Ningcheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luofei, and often beat and scolded her, but fortunately Ji Luofei was submissive and never refuted Ningcheng. Moreover, unlike Ningcheng, Ji Luofei had qualifications and could practice cultivation.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Second Star College of Cangqin, and was already a monk with three levels of qi. In the State of Cangqin, anyone who could practice cultivation was called a monk.
At this time, Ji Luofei had already carried him into a very low black stone house. Although the black stone house was low, it was not very small, at least it had everything. There was even a small yard with a deep well in the yard.
Even if it was about him, Ningcheng had to make it clear. Although he guessed it was the Jian and Qiu families who did it, he had to ask clearly.
"Why should you ask me about what you did yourself? "Ji Luofei answered simply and put Ningcheng down.
Then she poured another glass of water and fed it to Ningcheng, and said, "I'll boil water for you to bathe, and I'll forget some things, you know it's not good for you. "
Ningcheng watched Ji Luofei go in to boil water, and did not continue to ask, he understood Ji Luofei's meaning. With his ability, the more he knew, the faster he died.
I don't know if Ji Luofei added something to the glass of water, but Ningcheng felt that after drinking the glass of water, the whole person regained some strength.
Sitting on the old wooden bed, Ningcheng thought of his own situation and his sister Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muyi was treating him like that. According to his understanding of Tian Muyi, Tian Muyi was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Chu Li sailed on the lake, where the wind was blowing on his face, refreshing and refreshing.
Yi Guo Mansion is a huge lake with ten thousand hectares and ninety-nine islands, and the martial arts hall he is going to is eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the boat, he was of medium stature, with a fluttering blue shirt, and his ordinary appearance was quite heroic, looking at the boundless lake, his thoughts drifting away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days!
Tangtang high-energy physics researcher, the bright future of Xueba, the future of the great scientist, a small mistake in the experiment, after the explosion to this world, reincarnate a new life!
"Bang! "The muffled sound broke his meditative thoughts, and he turned to see a glittering carp jumping on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head, bent over and threw the carp back into the lake. He straightened up and a tall building came into his eyes.
The 100-meter-high building, glittering with bronze light, is thick and solemn, showing the majesty of the government.
This high-rise bronze building is the hall of martial arts!
In front of the martial arts hall was an open martial arts training ground, covered with red mud, where hundreds of people were practicing the exercises, practicing knives, swords, fists and hands, or interacting with each other.
Chu Li went ashore by boat, stepped on the martial arts training ground, and without walking a few steps, suddenly a handsome young man appeared, with a face like a crown of jade, eyebrows like a sword, and high spirits.
He was tall, tall, and looked down at him with his shoulders on his shoulders, "Chu, what are you doing here? "
Chu Li frowned, "Get out of the way, a good dog won't get in the way!"
The handsome young man chuckled and said, "Do you want to practice martial arts?"
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued walking, "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed, believe it or not, you can't eat and go for a ride? "
The government guards forbid private fighting, and do not allow fratricidal killing, the government guards are divided into guards and bodyguards, one martial arts and one text, the two are especially strictly prohibited private fighting, light is degraded, heavy is banished from the government.
Chu Li was a bodyguard who had not entered the bodyguard, while Zhuo Feiyang was a guard of the eight pins, and it was a big taboo for the guard to attack the bodyguard, so he fell to the ground and screamed, and Zhuo Feiyang would be severely punished even if he was a genius.
Zhuo Feiyang's eyebrows wrinkled: "The surname Chu, OK, shameless enough! "Chu Li continued to walk.
Zhuo Feiyang sideways to get out of the way, with a gloomy face: "Chu, you can only use these small means! "
Chu Li laughs and says, "It's enough to deal with a fool like you! "
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, his fist clenched tighter and tighter, as if he would wave it in the next moment, while Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a bright smile and raised his hand: "Zhao Shimei!"
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl curls up, her skin is snowy, her apricot eyes are willow eyebrows, her temperament is clear, gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly, and Zhao Ying, who entered the house at the same time, was beautiful, kind, and gentle, the kind of woman that men would like when they saw her.
"Brother Zhuo? "Zhao Ying came over lightly and said in surprise, "Brother Chu?"
Chu Li smelled the faint fragrance she brought and smiled, "Sister Zhao, I haven't seen you for a long time. "
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he has spent most of his time in the library, trying to change his fate with knowledge, and has rarely come to perform martial arts.
This time, I came to the martial arts hall because I had a problem with the practice of small chai-washing, and I wanted to read the secrets and notes of the practice of small chai-washing.
Zhao Ying said with a smile, "Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a beautiful job. "
Chu Li smiles and nods, "It's not bad. "
The East Garden directly belongs to the Yuqi Island of the Third Miss Xiao Qi, only he and Li Yue, the two bodyguards, not only leisurely, but also have the opportunity to meet the Third Miss, once the Third Miss blue eyes, the prosperity is just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy was very lucky, but he went into the East Garden, God is too blind, I have to take care of him!
"Sister Zhao, don't pay attention to this waste, I just practiced the swordsmanship yesterday, why don't you discuss it? "
Zhao Ying frowned and thought Zhuo Feiyang's speech was hard to hear.
"Okay, don't say he's a waste! "Zhuo Feiyang hurriedly laughed, glanced at Chu Li: "Even though he's a waste!"
Zhao Ying stared in dissatisfaction.
"Sister Zhao, it's okay, "Chu Li said with a smile. "There's no need to worry about this arrogant idiot."
"Chu master brother! "Zhao Ying said.
Chu Li stretched out his hand to make a gesture of surrender: "Sister Zhao, come to the East Garden to play, the scenery is beautiful, brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent. "
"Hum, what's there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang curled his mouth: "It's just flowers and plants, it's better to practice martial arts and play with things and lose heart!" "According to you, the third lady and the eldest son are playing with things and lose heart, not as much as you?"
Zhuo Feiyangjun's face turned red and he sneered and decided not to bicker with him.
"Brother Zhuo! Brother Chu! "Zhao Ying said in dissatisfaction: "You can stop for a while!... Brother Chu, I will go to play, you have something to be busy first."
Chu Li looked at her deeply and said, "Sister Zhao, someone has a good skin, and it takes a long time to see people's hearts, so don't trust others easily! "
"Chu, what do you mean?"
Chu Li ignored him and held his fist with a smile at Zhao Ying.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy to follow, and before leaving, while Zhao Ying was not paying attention, he suddenly stretched out his hand.
He almost slapped Chu Li in the face, and was very confident that Chu Li would not have time to avoid it. He didn't seem to pay attention, but he used his internal strength and was very fast.
Chu Li gently one side of his head, Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips against his cheeks, can feel the breeze, the strength of this palm is not light.
"Slap it!"
There was a crisp, loud slap.
Chu Li's left hand clapped on his face, crisp and loud, not much force, very loud, and then quickly stopped.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned to look. Chu Li's face did not change, as if the slap had not hit him in the face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him with a gloomy face. Chu Li smiled and felt his face: "It's really good work, I admire! "
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him.
"Brother Zhuo -! "Zhao Yingshen lowered the jade face.
"I can't help it, I really didn't mean it. "Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out of his teeth, and said coldly, "I'm sure Chu Shidi won't care, right, Chu Shidi?"
Chu Li turned his head and laughed and said, "Sister Zhao, forget it. "
Zhao Ying looked at him awkwardly, busily dragged Zhuo Feiyang to leave, and then stayed, the two must fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back motionless, touched the hot left face, and started the great round mirror wisdom to suppress the mood swings.
If it's not the great round mirror wisdom, it's inevitable to be plotted by Zhuo Feiyang!
The world respects martial arts and has been deeply rooted in the concept since childhood. Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, and protects herself openly and secretly, which makes him very moved.
But as a man, he needs a woman to protect him, and as a man, he can't bear it!
He passed through the crowd on the martial arts training ground and entered the martial arts hall.
He took off the wooden sign around his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the temple, who looked at him with a flash of lightning, indicating that he could enter.
In front of him were rows of bookshelves, and he walked along, stopped by chance, reached out his hand to pull out a book, quickly turned it over, put it back and walked on, stopped again, and turned over another book.
In one hour, he turned over twenty-two books.
It seems that he already knew the location of these books, and he just went over and took them out. In fact, he came here for the first time, and the little rinse-mai recipe was read in the library.
The whole hall of martial arts is presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of each book, clear and vivid.
He walked to the second floor and went directly to the third row of shelves. On the second floor, he drew out the book of the sword, turned it over, and then drew out seven secret books, which are the cultivation experience of the book of the sword.
When he left the martial arts hall, he had already imprinted 30 secret books in his mind, 22 small notes on the cultivation of washing the pulse, a book on breaking the false sword, and seven books on the cultivation of breaking the false sword.
As he sailed on the lake in his boat, the wind came slowly, and the original rage had dissipated.
The thirty secrets in my mind began to merge.
The sun was scorching at noon, and he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a small island with a circumference of two miles, divided into flower beds, each with a rare flower, the whole island floats with the fragrance of flowers.
There is only one small yard on the island, Chu Li pushed the door into the yard, the cool smell came to the face, a big tree covered half of the yard, to drive away the heat.
He entered the West Wing Room, came out with a Qingfeng sword, and waved it in the middle of the courtyard, slowly like a Taiji sword.
He never forgot it, and the secrets he read branded his mind once and for all, and the sword-breaking technique he just learned from the martial arts hall was really powerful, but it was also very exhausting.
"Squeaky... "A sturdy young man came out of the main hall, with a big face and small eyes.
He staggered like a black bear, stretched twice, yawned twice, and then said languidly, "Brother, you're back so early? "
Chu Li focused on practicing swords and only hummed. Li Yue, the Jiupin bodyguard, was in charge of the East Garden together, and they had a good appetite, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts skills, but they were afraid of death and did not enter the Jiupin Building, and were willing to be bodyguards.
The bodyguards and guards of the government are divided into nine items, with a salary difference of ten times.
The bodyguard pays less, the grade has to be seniority, three years nine products, ten years eight products, twenty years seven products, forty years six products, seventy years five products. Regardless of the other only look at martial arts, enter the nine products building, break through one floor to one product.
I earn a lot of money, I can often go out to do tasks, and I live a colorful life, unlike a bodyguard who can only stay in the house to wait on people, but whoever has a little ability, will be a guard.
Li Yue shakes his neck, stretches his legs, sends out a series of crackles in the bone joints, and then swings his fist to practice, like a meteor, whirling the wind.
"Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li uttered two words, and his brow was covered with soybean sweat.
Wushu is flourishing in this world, and the practice of martial arts begins with the doll.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are established, the magical mind method will do more than half the work, and it will take several times as long to build the foundation.
Before the age of 18, he missed building the foundation in the Akiba-ji Temple, where he grew up, and his spirit was twice that of ordinary people.
In addition, he was a high-energy physics researcher in his previous life, and his understanding of the world is far from comparable.
The combination of the two, he finally practiced the great wisdom of the original scripture, the achievement of the great round mirror wisdom.
The spirit is strong, the duration of his cultivation is much longer than that of ordinary people, the spirit is in the body, and he observes the micro, so his small trick of washing the veins is progressing very fast, and in five years he can build a foundation.
"Hehe..., with your sword, the chicken can't be killed, what are you still practicing? "
Chu Li suddenly stopped his sword and hummed, "Bibi? "
He was out of breath and soft all over, and only by holding his sword to the ground could he support himself, for it was too exhausting to break the sword.
1. Chapter 1
In the antique room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces soldier!
As soon as the hand fell, an electric shock-like pain came, and a pang of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
There was a soft female voice in my ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face and was looking at him with concern.
This is a classic beauty, breathtakingly beautiful, who can be described as alluring to the country.
Ling Tian, a Chinese.
He served in the most outstanding Lung Tooth Special Operations Force in China, and during his service, he made countless achievements.
He participated in the world-class special forces competition, won the personal honor of the first single combat ability, is recognized as the "king of soldiers"!
Later, during a cross-border SSS-level mission, a comrade-in-arms died due to a small personal mistake.
Under self-blame, he chose to retire and left the wolf's teeth.
After his retirement, he took a hiatus and chose to go abroad, becoming the trump card of one of the most famous mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it is his task, the success rate is unprecedented 100%!
Although he retired from Wolverine for many years, he still cares about China.
As long as it is a mission that is unfavorable to China, he will not only not take it, but will also pull out the person who issued the mission and carry out a merciless killing.
Over time, he has become a thorn in the eyes and a thorn in the flesh of all countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a time bomb.
However, as each killer evaporates, Ling Tian is more and more moist, and no killer dares to take on this "death mission."
Killing the sky is the same as seeking death. This is a universally recognized saying in the world of mercenary soldiers and killers.
Throughout the earth, we have never met an adversary, never lost!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted broker.
The R country manufactured a colorless and tasteless chemical and biological weapon, which was intended to be transported into China to carry out a terrifying conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian will not sit idly by.
He did it!
With the help of the broker, the location of the batch of chemical and biological weapons was found.
Just as he made a bloody way into the underground laboratory to destroy the biological and chemical weapons, the underground laboratory suddenly caved in, trapping him in a completely closed cage.
When I saw the people of the R country holding various kinds of guns, appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian understood.
I've been sold out by the person I trust most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the plot of the R people would not succeed.
Until he was shot indiscriminately and died, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"God, what's wrong with you? Don't be scared."
A soft voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely sure that he didn't know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at her close relatives, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
When Ling Tian was ready to argue with this beautiful woman.
Ling Tian was completely stunned as if he had been struck by lightning, as if he had been acupunctured.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy was also called Ling Tian, and his full name was Duan Lingtian.
Duan Lingtian, 15 years old.
Qingfeng Town, Li's foreign surname is his son.
His mother, Li Ruo, was the elder of the Li family.
His father... in his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of merging this strange memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Ling Tian was seriously injured in bed.
This morning, the youngest son of the seven elders of the Li family, Li Xin, scolded Duan Lingtian as a wild breed with a mother and no father to teach him.
However, he did not even finish the quenching, how could he be the rival of Li Xin, who was quenched twice, was directly seriously injured by Li Xin, dying.
After merging all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian is him.
"Madame, the host asked for the medicine to be delivered."
There was a sound in my ear, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A maid hurried in from outside the room and handed the delicate box to Li Ruo.
The box was opened and the smell of the medicine dissipated.
"God, come on, take the medicine, and my mother will heal your wounds. "
Li Ruo took out a black Dan medicine from the inside and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Take a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opens his mouth and swallows Dan medicine.
The medicine melted at the mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold current of air passed into his body, dissolving the warm current of Dan's medicine and healing his wounds.
After an hour, Li Ruo stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that the soreness on his body had mostly disappeared, and there was no burden.
What he just took was the magic medicine of the fairy, didn't he?
At this time, Duan Lingtian found that Li Ruo's face was pale and his brow was still sweating, obviously expending a lot of energy for his healing.
"Are you okay?"
Duan Lingtian warmed his heart.
This'mother', called kindly, there is nothing unnatural.
"It's okay, just take a rest."
Li Ruo smiles and shakes his head.
It's nothing to expend this energy for my son.
"He and the seven elders are still waiting in the criminal court. "Half an hour later, the maid came into the room again and said softly.
"Let's go and tell the person sent by the master, and I'll deal with it myself. "
Li Ruo's amiable face was completely gone, with a cold face.
"Mother, what kind of medicine did you give me just now, I feel my injury is almost healed. "
Duan Ling Tianxia went to bed, stretching his body slightly.
"It's'Bapin Jinchuangdan'. "
Originally, the eight pints of Jinchuangdan, even the Qingfeng town of Li's family, there are only two, now even used one on his foreign-named son.
It is obvious that his mother's status in the Li family is not low.
"God, the master is still waiting, we'll go over."
Li Ruo took Duan Lingtian with him to a spacious courtyard of the Li family's mansion.
This is the place where the Li family enforces the family law.
It was noon, and the sun was in the sky.
There were people standing around the criminal court, all of whom were the children of the Li family watching the fun.
In the yard, a teenager was tied to a Xingzhu in the sun, and two middle-aged people were standing beside him.
The middle-aged man on the right, seeing Duan Lingtian's mother and son, looks angry.
"Duan Lingtian also came... the family treasured eight pints of Jinchuangdan medicine is really powerful!" "Yes, when Duan Lingtian was carried back, I also saw it, half dead."
"Li Xin is the same, even if he bullies Duan Lingtian at will, the nine elders won't say anything, but this time he laid such a heavy hand, almost killed Duan Lingtian, the nine elders don't get angry is strange. "
One by one, the children of the Li family whispered as they watched Li's arrival.
Li Ruo, with Duan Lingtian, salutes the middle-aged man on the left.
"Nine elders, today's event, my son Li Xin made a mistake first, but now since you have nothing to do, my son has been exposed to the sun all morning, can you put him down? "
At this moment, the middle-aged man, who is the seven elders of the Li family, "Li Kun," looks gloomy.
Who knows, Li Ruo didn't talk to him at all.
Instead, he took Duan Lingtian and came to Li Xin, who was tied up.
"God, how did he hurt you in the morning, and now you'll give it all back to him! "Chapter 1
When Gu Shijiu woke up, she found a very deadly problem. The surrounding environment changed so much that she didn't know it at all!
Looking out through the gap in the cloister, the moon bends in the sky, the stars shine brightly, and she is lying on her back and being carried forward.
She was a little confused, she couldn't help moving, and then found a more deadly problem - she was naked! Her body was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, only a pair of eyes exposed.
Her cold eyes fell first on the two men who were carrying her.
Confucius martial arts is powerful, muscles are knotted, ancient warriors dress up, although carrying people to walk quietly, a look is practicing family, martial arts is not low.
Gu Shijiu's fingers in the quilt are tight!
She is the king of modern killers, cold and ruthless, the world, but she did not expect to meet the most trusted person's plot, the man named Longxi, her former instructor, also a doctor, she does not believe in anyone, only believe in him, even like him, want to marry him.
She was already dead, but she didn't go to see Mr. Yan for tea, but she came here for no reason.
Naturally, she didn't think she had arrived at a filming base.
She crossed it!
Walking through the body, it was wrapped like a zongzi and carried to a very luxurious hall.
"Ah... ah... help... help... help... ah, ah, don't... "The woman's delicate and painful scream came out in an instant, recalling the thoughts of Gu Shijiu Flying. Her eyes quickly glanced, a little stared! The furnishings in the hall were beautiful and natural, whether it was the red sandalwood tables and chairs, or the flower and bird tortoiseshell screen, all showed two words - noble!
The man above is handsome, twenty-seven or eight years old, with long hair pinned with a sapphire hairpin, loosely draped on the shoulders, smooth muscle texture, strong and powerful in the movement, he sips the corners of his lips, lightly hooks a cold smile, is a cool and handsome man.
Below is a young girl, who looks very young and beautiful, and the expression of the man's face is different from the enjoyment, the little girl's face is white, the mouth is slightly open, the voice has been hoarse, sobbing, cold sweat has wet her hair, obviously the pain is extreme.
This bastard, strong x seedling! Who the hell is he?
The two men came in with Gu Shijiu, but they couldn't disturb the man's good mood, and his movements were faster and more violent!
The little girl finally could not bear it, shouted a few times in a dumb voice, rolled her eyes, tilted her head, and did not move.
"Sad! "The man swore, turned over, came down from the girl, kicked the girl off the bed like garbage.
The girl didn't move, her little face had turned waxy yellow, and there was blood flowing from the corners of her lips. I didn't know if it was dead or alive.
"This is too useless, carry to the mass grave to feed the dog! "The man's tone is full of desire and dissatisfaction with the anger.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff City, is a small city in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, near Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, these four names many Chinese people have heard of, but the four regions wrapped in the middle of the flagpole city, it is estimated that not many people know.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of the "not many" until he came to Qipao City to study.
Flagstaff City is not well known in China, and it is not well known in the United States, but there are a few good universities, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American College, etc.
The school where Li Du studied abroad is called Flagstaff National College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but there is a huge difference between the two words!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of the American College, a very good private university, providing undergraduate, college, and preparatory education.
This is a pheasant university, and Li Du was completely tricked into coming to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid in the first half of the year, the school was closed down, the school board and the admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving a group of international students with ignorant faces and being chased away by the police.
Li Du is lucky, because the school accommodation is too chaotic, he did not live in a dormitory in order to study quietly, but found an apartment to rent, and now at any rate there is a place to live. His classmates who have paid the accommodation fee to live in the school, will be living on the streets.
But his situation is not much better than that of his classmates. It is the end of January, and his rent is due, and if he doesn't pay it in time, he may have to live on the street.
It's sad that he won't have any money!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and classmates and friends in China, but that presupposes that he is studying abroad. Now that the university is banned, he can't succeed as a graduate student, so why should he have the face to ask his elderly parents for money?
Sitting sadly in the doorway of the small building, the pine door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde girl poked out her head and said, "Hi, Li, are you here? "
The girl was his landlord, Hannah Fox, and the house was the legacy of her parents who died in a car accident and belonged to her and her brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be "busy with big business" and would not stay for a few days a year, so the spare bedroom was rented out by Hannah to generate income.
When he heard the call, Li Du stood up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's the matter? "
The girl shrugged her shoulders and smiled, and a pear swirl appeared on her beautiful face: "I saw a few cans of beer when I was cleaning the refrigerator, it must have been left by Hans. I remember you like wort beer, why don't you drink it? "
She carried half a dozen six bottles of beer in her hand, in a common wooden box with a clear Budweiser logo on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiles, there is only a small refrigerator in the apartment, he opens and closes every day, what kind of beer is there?
Besides, with Hans's temper, if there was beer, he wouldn't stay, because he's a drunkard.
He guessed that Hannah had bought the beer to comfort him, and after learning that their school had been closed, Hannah had comforted him many times, which made him very moved.
But Hannah didn't have many ways to comfort him, either by giving him an inspirational book or by giving him beer.
The American girl once asked him to learn about Chinese culture and learned the saying "one drunk solves a thousand worries." She thought that according to the Chinese character, a drunken sleep can relieve his worries, so she gave him beer several times.
When Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness, he owed the girl a favor. In American society, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise they will be misunderstood to reject friendship, and he cherishes his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile, saying before leaving, "There are many problems in life, but it's still beautiful. "
After saying this American slang several times, Li Du opened the package and wanted to take out a can of beer, but as soon as he opened the wooden box, a crystal like amber suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a "kick. "
The crystal was about the size of his thumb, and it fell heavily on the concrete, and there were a few cracks on it.
The reason why I guessed it was amber was because it was pale yellow in color and was wrapped with a small worm, which was very similar to the amber he saw in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, there was a text called "Amber" in their textbook, and the Chinese teacher brought an amber to them in class.
The crystal reminded him of some beautiful times in his childhood, and he remembered that his teacher said that the amber covered with worms was very precious. Unfortunately, the crystal had cracked, which made him very sorry, otherwise selling it would not be able to exchange for two months of living expenses.
The crystal fell very badly, and when he picked it up, it broke apart, and the purple worm wrapped in it was exposed.
The worm looks like a locust, it is about two centimeters long, it looks strange, has locust-like compound eyes, but only two legs under the stomach, the legs have strange lines, there are no wings on the back, it looks very awkward.
Li Du had never seen such a worm, so he held it up strangely to see it clearly.
Just then, something treacherous happened: the worm's claws suddenly moved, and then quickly regained their vitality, wriggling his body and breaking free from his fingers.
He didn't react to it, but the worm jumped into the palm of his hand, and his head fell down, slowly and little by little into his hand!
Li Du is afraid to pee, really want to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled into the house, shouting, "Hannah, call 911! Help, there's a worm in my hand! "
Presumably his screams were too bitter, and Hannah came out with a panicked expression: "What? What worm? "
Li Du spread out his hand to her and said, "This is it, the worm in my palm! "
Hannah's face was dazed: "The worm in your palm? Where is the worm in your palm? "
Not only was there a worm, but the worm was still moving. After it got into the palm of Li Du's hand, it seemed to be lonely, and it would get out again, and half of its body would get out.
Li Du pointed to the worm that was burrowing out and said in fear, "This, this is it, purple locusts, can't you see? "
Li Du interrupted her and shouted, "I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah! "
"Shet, the worm has come out again!"
Just as he was screaming at the top of his voice, the worm slowly got out of his skin and jumped to the ground, reached up and supported himself with his legs, and walked on the ground with his legs like a human being.
It happened that next to the ground was a drain, and the worm didn't pay attention to it and fell headlong.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, "Great, the worm fell into the drain. "
Subconsciously, he thought, what's in the drain? Could there be sewage and drown the worm?
But something unbelievable happened to him!
Chapter 1
China, the North Desert.
Ice and snow ravage the whole land, the mountains and valleys are covered in silver, the goose feathers and snow rustle down, the sky and the earth look the same from a distance.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan was resting, and the wind and snow were so strong that it was difficult for the carriages to walk, so they had to wait for the wind and snow to ease before they went on the road.
"Look, pull the coffin! "
The exclamation of a middle-aged man attracted the attention of the caravan, and a group of people looked up curiously into the distance, only a few eyes, all of them were shocked!
As the wind and snow roared all over the sky, the sky and the earth became blurred, and a mysterious golden coffin loomed in the distance, gradually appearing in the public view.
The golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the walls of the coffin were engraved with simple patterns and runes. The patterns and runes radiated a faint light, which isolated all the falling snowflakes, and were extremely strange.
Another thing that amazed the crowd was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
He was a young man, who looked only fourteen or five years old. He was naked, with his upper body hunched over his back, holding two huge chains of cold iron in his hands, carrying the chain on his shoulders, and trying to pull the ancient coffin step by step.
Ice and snow, the boy pulls the coffin!
The picture is very visually impactful and breathtaking. The glimmering light from the golden ancient coffin in the back reflects the young man's body a little blurry, and his face can not be seen clearly. In a trance, people seem to see a god pulling a coffin.
"The boy is born with magical powers."
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people came back to their senses and carefully looked at the young man to make sure that he didn't have any mystical power to shine, and he was moved again.
Ordinary willow coffins have three or four hundred jin, and this ancient coffin is cast with gold, needless to say at least three thousand jin.
If a young man has no power, he is not a real warrior. Even a strong man has only five or six hundred jin of strength. A young man can pull a three-thousand-jin ancient coffin, which looks a bit difficult, but it is shocking enough.
"Young and handsome, he came to pull the coffin, this young man wants to be unlucky for a lifetime? "
An elderly man was moved, and many people nod their heads in agreement. Although it is not common to pull the coffin, it happened occasionally in the history of the North Desert, and everyone knows about it.
When important members of the Northern Desert family die, they like to be buried in golden coffins. These coffins are not buried under the earth, but are placed on the top of the iceberg, which is said to protect the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters great changes, the family will hold a coffin-drawing ceremony to find a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffins of the family, replace the feng shui, and recast the family's well-being.
This led to the appearance of the coffin puller.
Pull the coffin is a thing that is harmful to qi, in the minds of many people in the North Desert, when pulling the coffin, their own qi will be absorbed by the body in the coffin, the body essence and Yangshou will also be absorbed, will be unlucky or ill for a lifetime.
Therefore, pulling coffins is the most base occupation in the North Desert, even if the commission is high, young warriors will not be moved, only the down-and-out old warriors will pull coffins.
The young man has beautiful features, is about 1.75 meters tall, has wide shoulders and narrow waist, slender legs, and knotted muscles. He wears a simple animal tooth on his neck, and looks wild, which is very good in terms of appearance.
Fourteen or five years old, handsome in appearance, with a terrifying power, the condition of a young man is not bad. But to do this most base and insidious work of pulling a coffin?
"He's not afraid of being robbed of his fortune, his life will be greatly reduced, and he'll have a lifetime of bad luck?" The middle-aged man stared at the golden coffin and glanced at it, and said, "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family? Yes, I heard that the Liu family recently suffered a big change, and the price was sky-high."
"Silence, the Lius are coming, "an old man said suddenly, and all the caravan members shut up and looked into the distance.
Wow!
In the distance, there was a howl of wild animals, and a team of warriors in black armor and riding silver wolves rushed to their faces before approaching the fierce breath of the wolves.
"The Silver Wolf Guards are indeed the warriors of the Liu family. "
The crowd nods secretly, the whole area around Wuling City is thousands of miles, only one army riding the silver wolf, the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the teenager, and a middle-aged giant in the front, holding a long whip, looked at the teenager and shouted, "Lu Lei, walk quickly! If you don't pull to Black Eagle Mountain before dark, you won't have any reward."
The teenager called Lu Li looked up and was surrounded by a dozen huge silver wolves one meter high and two meters long. He didn't have much fear and nod his head and said, "You can rest assured, I will arrive before dark."
The giant man shouted and rushed off with the Silver Wolf Guard, quickly vanishing into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan staying nearby and continued to walk silently, pulling the coffin. He grasped the huge chain of cold iron in his hands and carried it on his shoulders, each step was extremely difficult, and his muscles trembled. Nevertheless, he did not stop at all, and quickly passed the caravan and walked into the distance.
"It's so heavy!"
After walking for a few miles, Lu Li stopped after climbing a steep slope. He was out of breath, and in such cold weather, he was sweating so hot that he could imagine how much energy he was expending.
He wanted to rest for a while, and after placing the coffin, he sat on a stone and took water and dry meat from the sack behind him, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
I should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat, he looked at the sky, his eyes quickly became brighter, saying to himself: "Pull a coffin can be exchanged for a Dan medicine, I do not know if the Liu family's quenched body Dan is really like the legend, one can increase the strength of 500 jin? "
"If I can really increase the strength of 500 jin, I now have three thousand jin strength, only need to pull a dozen coffins can reach ten thousand jin strength, can... wake up the blood! "
"Look who dares to bully my sister in the tribe? Hey, hey, I'll soon be able to take my sister to a good life. "
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face glowed with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his footsteps were more steady and fast.
Sand and sand!
After walking for a few miles, a sound sounded behind him, and Lu Li looked back, his face a little dark.
There was also a man in the back, but he was an old man. The old man's hand was holding the chain with white light on the road, and there was a faint white light on his feet.
Lu Li muttered enviously that white light is the metaphysical power that only a warrior has. A warrior with metaphysical power will have a lot more power, and the old man used his metaphysical power, which is how he can walk like a fly and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man chased Lu Li, he looked at him, frowned and said, "Boy, why do you pull the coffin? It will damage your luck. "
Lu Li smiled and said nothing, the old man looked at him a few times, no more words, and quickly pulled the coffin away.
"If you can't wake up the blood, then what is the future to speak of? Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, and my sister suffers. "
"No, this is not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became a little twisted, he roared, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
As the wind and snow grew heavier and heavier, the sky gradually became darker, and the glimmering light of the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain path appeared to be very mysterious and mysterious.
Download Chapter 001
"My brother is going to look for a job, you can do your homework at home, here is ten yuan, don't forget to go out to buy something to eat at noon. "
In front of a low-rise hut in the slum area, Lu Li patted little Laurie's head and rubbed it pitifully. It was nice to see her sister so healthy and lively!
"I know, brother, "Little Laurie complained, "Don't rub my hair, it's all messed up by you."
Her sister Lu Xin was very considerate in helping Lu Li to arrange her clothes, and like a little adult, she told her, "I must work hard, my brother is so hard-working, I believe I will be able to find a job this time."
"Take it easy, my brother will find a good job, earn a lot of money, let Xinxin live a good life," Lu Li held his sister, secretly added, because of no money, and will not helplessly watch you lose your life a little bit.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will earn a lot of money, "Little Laurie wriggled in Lu Li's arms and swore with her little fist.
No matter how sad, Lu Li said goodbye to her sister.
When he got on the bus, his hand in his pocket paused and he couldn't help laughing bitterly.
The money I gave my sister for lunch just now came back into my own pocket, and I should have expected the little girl to do this.
Now in the 23rd century, science and technology are infinitely developed, and all kinds of intelligent technologies are flooding every corner of the world. This development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but by the way, it has also reduced the demand for manpower to a minimum.
Unemployment is no longer a rare thing, especially for people from the lowest levels of society, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there were no surprises, he would remain unemployed.
It was not until a coincidence that he joined a game union, but because he entered the game called Dawn, the game had been open for nearly a year, and the level was too far behind, so he was not among the super-skilled.
Two years later, her sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a physical examination at school.
He had no money to pay for millions of treatments, and was chased by several unions during the game, only to watch his only relative weaken day by day.
The taste was even worse than cutting meat with a knife, and Lu Li held her sister in her arms and wept bitterly more than once.
However, fate took a turn. On the day of receiving the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and went to sleep in front of her sister's hospital bed.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, a lot of money.
With money, we can cure our sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money can we let her live the happy life that innocent and lovely girls should live, like her countless peers.
Only with money will you be proud, and never be inferior to others!
After all, Lu Li was helpless to find that even if he was born again, it would not be easy to become rich.
It seems that all I can do is play games - the Dawn he's been playing for more than two years - and now it's only a few days before the game opens.
Lu Li has given up his plan to find a serious job, and today he went directly to the headquarters of the Star Moon Trade Union, where he served in his past life.
The Star Moon Union is not one of the top ten games, nor is it one of the top four in China, it is just a game alliance composed of a group of college students, the leaders of the union are very rich rich second generation, because they are willing to spend money, so the development is also very good.
Located next to the university town, Qinghu District is the most beautiful place of this generation, surrounded by mountains and rivers, full of cherry blossoms, in front of the office building, behind the villa area, only very rich people can set up a company here.
The beauty at the front desk looked at Lu Li's clothes in disgust, called a series of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that she could go in for an interview.
"At present, we only recruit death squads, the gold medalist does not accept, "the person in charge of the recruitment is a girl, dressed very trendy, while painting her nails, while not lifting her head in charge of the interview.
The so-called death squads are actually cannon fodder, and it is normal for a dozen people to die a day.
Lu Li wanted to find a studio to join, the purpose is to use the studio's game helmet for free, although the gold player has no future, but at least can upgrade, doomed to upgrade difficult cannon fodder is not what he wants, death in the game will lose experience.
"What, 20 gold! "The nail polish was smeared on her face, and the girl screamed like a cat that had been stepped on.
Although Dawn represents the most advanced virtual technology today, with the world's most first-class design team, it is not confident enough to dare to market without the inside, but the content of the test is relatively small, and it is decentralized testing, and will not have an impact on the normal game.
After just a few days of testing, the player was most impressed by the fact that gold coins are not easy to play, and there are too many places to spend money.
Normal gamers basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold players can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that if they want to accumulate enough 20 gold to establish a union, a hundred people will play gold to brush the appropriate monsters, remove the repair equipment and potion consumption, at least it will take a week or more, this is the game before the third system update of the money burst rate is high.
And now this boy, he promised to take out 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you ever participated in the inside, did you find any bugs to brush money? "the recruitment beauty was moved, asked suspiciously.
Lu Li laughs and does not speak, appearing to be extremely unfathomable.
"Ao Jian, I have something to do here, you come over... Well, someone came to apply for a goldsmith, said that he can pay 20 gold in a week, I suspect he has a BUG to brush money, "there is no way to recruit a beautiful woman, can only quietly call the high-level.
After a while, I heard a rush of footsteps, and when I looked around, Lu Li was also a little unexpected.
In addition to the boss of Star Moon, the arrogant sword, there were several people who came with him. Lu had been in the Star Moon Trade Union for two years, and most of these people knew each other, all of them were high-level members of the trade union.
"Oh, don't tell me, this is the boy who can get twenty gold a week, "the little man walking next to the arrogant sword could not help howling, the game name of this man is half a cigarette, is the leader of the Star-Moon Union band of thieves, is a very fretful person.
"You have a way to get twenty gold coins in a week, is it the game Dawn? "Ao Jian's face is not very good-looking, originally was holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope is gone.
Lu Li is ordinary in appearance, his face is waxy and swarthy, his clothes are wrinkled, and there are obvious traces of wear and tear at the corners, so he is the kind of person who rolls and crawls at the bottom of society.
"There's no reason to say it, even if you can't get you, there's not much loss, isn't it?" Facing the huge aura, front and back of the social elite, Lu Li Hun did not have the crampedness of the bottom of the little people, just a faint smile, calm eyes seem to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter 1
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay, get up quickly, the class is about to start, this class is ruthless, you hurry up. "A voice in a hurry sounded in Ye Mo's ear, Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
"This idiot, I think he has no face to see, so he covers his face. "Another voice rings in his ear, but Yemo wakes up.
Ye Mo looked around a little dazed, no one knew, all were strange faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's dazed appearance, there was another burst of laughter, it was obvious that the laughter was directed at him, and the people around him seemed to be laughing at him, and he dared not ask questions for a moment, so he had to be on guard to prevent someone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seems that he was the only one who didn't laugh at himself, just now he kindly pushed himself to wake up.
"How is it like a school? "Ye Mo asked subconsciously in surprise.
"Ha, ha... "There was another burst of laughter.
"Ye Mo, I think you are angry and confused, Yan Yan can also write love letters at will? You are okay in the Ye family, now you are not a member of the Ye family, be careful later. "
The deskmate sighed, of course, he didn't believe that Ye Mo would not remember after a while, just love face. He hadn't recognized the reality, he was no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head was in bouts of pain, and he remembered that he and Master Luo Ying were refining back to Yuandan, and then the group of mixed hairs at Xiliumen came to fight, and then there were explosions and all kinds of fighting sounds, and he remembered that Master held himself in his arms and used a evasion charm, but how did he appear here?
By the way, I'm sitting here now, what about Master? Master is only three years older than him, and the reason why Xiliumen suddenly attacked them was because Master was too beautiful, and the young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful Master, but it was only after Master refused.
If Master fell on Xiliumen's hand, the consequences would be unthinkable, and Yemo couldn't help but panic and suddenly stood up.
"What's the matter, don't you know the bell rang?" A young woman with a cold face walked up to the platform with a few books in her hand, coldly glanced at the students laughing below, and the laughter suddenly subsided.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, an English lecturer, and the most annoying thing is that the students heckle him, and once she catches him, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already feels that something is wrong, although he understands these words, but the obvious language is not his original language, is it not Luo Yue mainland?
Ye Mo was completely expelled from the Ye family after his father died, the specific reason being that Ye Mo was not a species of Ye Qian Tian. More precisely, after the death of Ye Mo's father, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-identified and identified as not a species of the Ye family, which led to the matter of being expelled from Yemen.
However, he also has a sister, Ye Ling, and a brother, Ye Feng, but they are not the same mother, but half-brothers and sisters. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Mo, so he purposely asked his father to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianqian probably knew that he was not in good health, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, and he found the Ning family in the capital city.
The Ning family was of course very willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China, and gave Ning Qianxuexu, the granddaughter of Mr. Ning, to Ye Mo.
In a hospital physical examination, Ye Mo was found to be impotent, to put it plainly, it is not humane. Although the Ye family tried to hide the fact, but overnight it seems that the whole Beijing people know that one of the five families of China, the Ye family had a day of impotence, the Ye family is also a big loss of face.
"Ah... "The memory was turned over here, Yemo shouted, stood up, and almost immediately took off his trousers to look at it. He already knew that he might be reborn into a person named Yemo, but he was not humane, it was better to kill him.
"The classmate, what's your name, what do you shout in class, go to my office after class. "The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's shouting, and her face was very unsightly.
The rest of the class was laughing to themselves, and asked a college student to go to the office at the first moment. I guess only the English teacher could come out, but if he didn't, he couldn't.
Ye Mo sat down decadently, although he did not understand the inside story of the family struggle, but also some understand that he was probably driven out of the Ye family because of impotence, not necessarily because he is not a member of the Ye family, and who knows who did something in the DNA test.
Ye Mo is not worried about being driven out of the Ye family, he doesn't care about this, he cares about his impotence. There is also what happened to his master, Luo Ying.
However, he also understood why his classmates were laughing, because his predecessor had been driven out of the Ye family, and he still wanted to pursue the hottest girl in the class, Yanyan. As a result, they pasted their love letter on the blackboard, and then stood on the platform and looked at themselves scornfully and said, "Master Ye, can you have sex with me? "
Later, after the impotence was spread out, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed and wanted to face, but what he didn't expect was that the girl who was fawning on him actually did so to him, and then he fainted in a hurry, cheapening his rebirth.
He was reborn in such a place. He couldn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's lecture on the platform, even if he could understand it, Ye Mo would not listen to it, and he absolutely couldn't accept that he was impotent now. It's better not to be reborn than to be reborn like this.
It doesn't matter if he doesn't go to college, the main thing is to find out his current situation. His impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family, although he was expelled from the Ye family, but who knows if he will be suddenly killed? Maybe there are other insiders that caused him to be expelled from the Ye family, now his safety is still guaranteed?
After the bell rang, Ye Mo's first thing was not to go to the beautiful teacher's place, of course, but rushed out of the school, he wanted to find a place to see his little **, is it really impotent.
Luckily, there weren't many other things next to Ninghai University, but there were many small alleys, so Ye Mo hurried into a remote and deserted alley and pulled down his trousers.
Small ** is really small, but Ye Mo did not disappoint because of small ** small, but really hissed. He is not impotent, but because small ** is too big, by a meridian blocked the development, resulting in this false impotence situation.
But that's it, with the technology on Earth today, it's no doubt a dream to open up his blocked meridian, but it's hard to beat Ye Mo, although he doesn't have the ability to open the blocked meridian and make his little ** strong, but as long as he reaches the three levels of qi practice, the meridian will automatically be opened.
However, Ye Mo immediately began to be a little disappointed again, because in the case of the earth's world and earth, the strength is so thin, want to cultivate to the three levels of qi, no doubt it is a difficult task, maybe he will never be able to achieve it, in that case, he is still the same as impotence.
"Playing hooligans... "A soprano who is absolutely high decibel, sounded in front of Yemo, Yemo just checked his small **, and forgot to check the situation around him. I didn't expect that this small alley is still connected, but the front corner can't be seen here.
Yemer is not an exhibitionist, and he has no capital exposure now, so he pulls up his pants and walks away.
"Ye Mo, why are you? "the woman screamed and asked in a surprised tone, obviously knowing Ye Mo.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Late at night, Qingzhu high-level residential area in Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sits quietly on a soft leather sofa, holding a pile of documents in his hand, looking out of the floor-to-ceiling window at the swimming pool, full of frustration and reluctance.
As the leader of Shadow, one of the four major game studios in Jinhai, he heads the Grand Guild of tens of thousands of people, and is a well-known master sword magician in Jinhai, but now he can only sit at home drinking alcohol to relieve his worries.
A ten-year gaming career.
Ten years of bloody fighting.
After experiencing countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild to establish ten city-states in "The Divine Domain," and when he could begin to compete with the first-class guilds and enjoy endless glory, a paper document became a thing of the past, never to return.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of efforts would be in vain, for the game, he gave up so much, but in the end became someone else's wedding dress, all because he opposed the shadow to merge into the super guild to dominate the world, less than the next day Lanhua Foundation gave him a reply, delete the 200-level sword king account that he spent ten years of hard work to develop, go to the financial department to settle the salary.
All he can get is five million credit points and a mansion, which is less than a drop in the bucket compared to the ten city-states established, the virtual kingdom of daily gold.
Shi Feng thought that he had paid so much for the shadow, so that Lanhua Group became a big consortium, a lot of credit is his, but the result was like throwing garbage, he lost him, for what the Lanhua consortium did, he will retaliate.
"I'll never forget it and start again."
Shi Feng's eyes flashed with confidence and firmness, and the documents in his hand were torn to pieces. He then picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and took a few mouthfuls.
Even if you don't have the Sword King account and the support of your team, the technology and knowledge in the game won't betray him. As long as the technology is still there, you can rise up in the Godland and build your own virtual kingdom again.
In the morning, the sun was just rising.
Drop by drop!
The phone rings constantly.
Shi Feng was dissatisfied with being woken up, helpless to get up and pick up the bedside mobile phone, last night's hangover is still fainting.
"Hello, what's the matter?"
"Feng Ge, I'm Kurozi, what else do you ask? We agreed to become a professional gamer, today is the recruitment day of the school's shadow studio, don't you always want to become the core member of the shadow? "
Shifeng was a little confused.
I've just been fired by the Lanhua Group, how can I go to the shadow examination. "Feng Ge, Feng Ge?
Are you listening? They'll test it at ten o'clock, and if you don't come quickly, it'll be too late! "
"Black son, don't be kidding, I've just been fired by the shadow. "
"How much did you drink yesterday, Brother Feng? You haven't woken up yet, and the shadow hasn't hired anyone, so why were you fired?
Shi Feng didn't respond, so Kurozi hung up the phone.
Drowsy Shi Feng looked at his mobile phone and found that the old Love Crazy Six was not his mobile phone at all, but his mobile phone was the latest Love Crazy Twelve.
Then I looked around. The small bedroom of less than 15 square meters was a mess, full of books about game strategy guides, and the laptop on the corner desk was also a very backward old model, the large wardrobe by the wall, scattered a lot of clothes, and in the fitting mirror of the large wardrobe appeared a familiar face.
When Shi Feng saw this familiar face, he was taken aback.
Shi Feng immediately got up and went to the fitting mirror, looked at it again and again, only to be sure that he was really young.
Yesterday, I slept in a large and luxurious bedroom, and now I get up in this terrible place, and I'm young.
Shifeng still has some memories of this place. It was ten years ago, I rented a small house for more than half a year when I was a senior in the Divine Domain, and then I made some money in the Divine Domain, so I rented a big apartment in the city.
I think it was a very difficult year, the situation at home was not good, in order to let him go to college, he also owed a lot of foreign debt, so his parents also worked hard to earn enough money every month to send enough living expenses, to make himself suffer.
Shi Feng wanted to make money to change his family situation, but college students were all over the street, want to find a good-paying job is more difficult than the day, so he thought of the most lucrative virtual game, in order to improve the game technology, he heartlessly bought a virtual helmet, has become a professional player as the goal, in the virtual game hard training skills.
At that time, he ate white noodles and bubble noodles every day, in order to save money, the class organized class reunions or social networking did not participate, so he became a little transparent in the class, the boys despised, the girls saw it far away, every time to buy bubble noodles in the supermarket, the wallet was less than 10 credit points, even one credit point of ham sausage dare not buy, the saleswoman saw Shi Feng pitiful, recommended special ham, Shi Feng looked at the attractive ham, and touched the wallet, or gritted his teeth and refused.
"Is it someone who's kidding me?"
Shi Feng looked at the familiar scene and his young self in the mirror and shook his head, rejecting the idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his mobile phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Am I born again? "Shi Feng joked with a wry smile on his face.
He remembers that today is August 5, 2139, and it can't be April 2129, when he was still a senior.
Shi Feng shook his head and wanted to be sober, but he still had a little hope in his heart that he could be reborn, really back ten years ago, so he went to the computer table and opened the laptop.
If the time of the mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the Internet can not be faked.
After a few minutes on the Internet.
Shi Feng was completely shocked, he inquired on the Internet all kinds of information, all show that today is indeed April 19, 2129, even the official opening time of the world's hot Gods, the official website is very clear, the countdown is six days later on April 25.
"Am I really back ten years ago? "Shi Feng stared at the news reports of the Divine Realm, leaving tears of excitement in the corner of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood is indescribable, with regret, sadness, and joy.
It was as if everything in front of you was a dream.
But the sound of cicadas outside the window, and the air-conditioner, remind Shi Feng that all this is true.
Looking at the family photos taken in college on his mobile phone, Shi Feng never found that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles around the eyes, they were really old and not as vibrant as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the Divine Domain, high debts, excessive labor and pressure, so that his parents were seriously ill, became ill, and needed millions of credit points to recover, but at that time, Shifeng was just a small team leader of the shadow, the money earned could not pay such expensive expenses.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng did everything he could, but it was not enough, and even though Shi Feng did everything he could to maintain it, his parents left a few months later.
In his last life, he didn't take good care of his parents, and who knows his pain and regret?
Even if Shifeng later earned millions of credit points, this has become a permanent pain in Shifeng's heart.
Unexpectedly, fate played such a joke on him, and he really started from scratch, everything returned to the origin.
"Okay, great, hahaha. Since I'm born again, I'll change all this, earn enough money, cure my parents' illnesses, and don't let them work for life. "Shi Feng wiped his tears from the corners of his eyes and swore secretly.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Kurozi called again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for examination.
However, Shi Feng was not in a hurry, put on his clothes, packed up and went to Jinhai University.
He was familiar with shadows.
I remember that when I was in college, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of Lanhua Group, opened a shadow studio, and at the same time provided a lot of funds to organize the master students in Jinhai University to fight in the divine domain, then he also went to the examination, and became a core member, Kurozi became a peripheral member, and he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, Shadow Studio had his leadership, which made Lanhua Group make a lot of money in the Divine Domain, and became a big money group, but in the end, it was fired by Blue Dragon himself.
Since he was born again, he still has incomparable advantages over the divine domain, naturally he is not ready to join the shadow, become a tool for others, to make money for others, he has to take a different path, to fight for his own life, do not have to let his parents send living expenses, pay off all debts, so he has to start his own business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng came to the No. 1 teaching building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking around the gate, anxious, this man was Kurozi.
"Brother Feng, you've finally come, but fortunately the registration deadline is not closed, let's go in quickly to sign up. "Broko said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously, "Black son, I'm not going to go to Shadow, I'll open my own studio, will you come? "
Kuroko is known in a virtual game, the technology is very good, and then together to enter the world, can be said to be brothers, in the days of working together in the shadow, although Kuroko has no game talent, but the management is very strong, the guild hundreds of thousands of people managed in an orderly manner, if there is Kuroko's help, the realization of the goal will be further, but he will follow Kuroko's choice, after all, he has nothing, Kuroko's family is not good, in order to make a living decided to be a professional player, join the shadow to earn living expenses.
After a full minute, Kurozi looked up at the peak.
"Brother Feng, don't be silly, do you know how much a virtual helmet is? That's 8,000 credit points, open a studio, at least six people, workspace, pay salaries, and so on, just the start-up capital of seventy-eight thousand, there is follow-up investment, that's a lot of money, but now you have so much money?" Kurozi understands the situation of Shifeng, know that Shifeng's family is not well off, want to persuade Shifeng to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy the Godland virtual helmet now." Shi Feng silently nodding and admitted, as Kuroko said, even seventy-eight thousand said less, remember that the 100-person studio recruited by Blue Dragon spent more than five million, and later in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio, spent a lot more.
"In that case, why bother to take the risk, it's not more stable to go to the shadow, at least the shadow can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become professional players." Kurozi saw that Shi Feng understood the key problem, immediately relieved, he pulled Shi Feng to enter the teaching building.
Shi Feng threw off Kurozi's hand, looked at Kurozi seriously, and said, "But I'm still going to open my own studio, I don't want to be controlled, Kurozi, will you come? "
Shi Feng would not force Kurozi, after all, he had no security, and could not tell the secret that he was a born again, only hoped that Kurozi could believe him.
When Kurozi saw Shifeng's serious look, he always felt that today's Shifeng was very strange, too crazy, virtual games can not make money in the early stage, everyone knows this, is there any way to make money in the divine domain? Even if making money is a few months later, they don't have so much time to waste.
Kuroko hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed, "I know, who asked you to be the big brother, I'll open a studio with you, but what about virtual helmets, we can't play games without helmets? "
Shi Feng's tight brow immediately relaxed, happily patted Kurozi's shoulder, laughing: "This is my good brother, let's rest assured about the virtual helmet, I remember that there is a college student trial discount, every university has a place to issue, as long as you have a student ID, you can get a virtual helmet free trial for ten days, let's go to have a look."
Kurozi's swarthy face turned black at this time, feeling that the future is dark, why would I believe in Shifeng? Is it Shifeng's confidence and stability? With Shifeng to start a business, really no problem?
What can I do in the Divine Realm in ten days?
Ten days past, I'm sure I'll miss the opportunity to recruit people in major studios, and in the end, I don't want to buy a virtual helmet, but how will the money come?
If you want to earn 16,000 credit points in the ten days that the Divine Domain opens, even a group of professional players can't do it!
"Just give me the money."
Shi Feng patted Kurozi on the shoulder, showing a confident smile.
Earning 16,000 credit points in ten days is whimsical, but he has the spirit of a reborn person, no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break one by one. And the opening of the Divine Realm is the beginning of his rise.
Then Shi Feng took Kurozi to get a trial helmet, and bought all the money to buy instant noodles, put on the computer table in the rental room, two large boxes, enough for more than ten days of food, after explaining some things about the Divine Domain, quietly waiting for the opening of the Divine Domain.
At nine o'clock on the evening of April 25, there was a glimmer of light in the dark and silent hut.
Shi Feng lay on the bed, closed his eyes, and clicked the start button of the helmet.
"I'm here."
I couldn't tell what it was, and it seemed to penetrate the body and rush into the soul, making the body shiver in the cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpers across the sky and earth, and the snow flutters with the wind, fragmenting the sky and covering the earth layer by layer, and from a distance, if covered in silver, the land is desolate.
It was not late at night, but only dusk, but the dimness of the sky was like the night, giving a heavy feeling, as if pressed on the heart, breathless. On the silver land, a huge silhouette could be seen, a majestic city, as if a giant animal were threatening.
In the center of the city, there is a towering pagoda-shaped altar, in the shape of seven corners, black through the body, straight into the cloud peaks, standing in the wind and snowstorm, lofty and motionless, the sound of the whimpering wind blowing on the altar is mixed with the sound of the Kara-Kara, scattered in the distance, with a primitive roughness, with a unique charm.
The hoarse murmur, which floated from the altar in the wind and snow, seemed to merge with the wind, and was faintly indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where is it? If there is no hope, why let me see it!! "The voice was mad, almost hysterical, roaring for nine days.
Under the altar, there are countless figures in hygroscopic clothes, standing there silently, from a distance, there are hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, around the altar, densely packed, motionless, but there is a fever, like the people on the altar, they can pay everything for it.
The snow, it's bigger.
"Since you let me see it, there must be hope, but hope... where! "The hoarse voice on the altar with bitterness, containing sadness, for a long time.
"Today, Ming Huang returned by mistake, Santai cleared the land, the snow wind came, the old man will be a barbarian again!" The voice suddenly became loud, I do not know what means to perform, but saw the sky on the wind and cloud color change, the countless falling snowflakes all suddenly stopped, then all rolled back, from all sides howling to come together, making the sky and the earth tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky, and all the snowflakes condensed to form a huge snow-colored dragon, who looked up to the sky and hissed as soon as he was formed, and his voice was so bitter that all those who heard it were shocked and torn apart by the sound.
Shocking bursts of blood poured out of the snow dragon, and soon permeated his whole body, making the snow dragon as a blood dragon, its bitter roar, struggling body rushed to the sky, like a meteor straight into the sky, as if to open a hole in the sky, open a hope.
Its speed is so fast, the blink of an eye is endless, the roaring and gyrating, as if the dragon crashed into some invisible diaphragm, the sky and the earth vibrated, the humming sound spread to all sides, the blood dragon again screamed bitterly, the body collapsed layer by layer with the speed visible to the naked eye.
At the moment when it was about to completely disintegrate, the hundreds of thousands of silent people under the altar, all pinch the knack with their hands, bite the tip of their tongues, and spew out a mouthful of blood, which seemed to be drawn by some force, and galloped up, as if the sea of blood were to rise in the air, straight to the collapsing blood dragon, and after merging with it, the collapse of the dragon was eased and rushed to a higher horizon.
Seeing the blood dragon flying higher and higher, everyone's eyes were condensed, but at this moment, the blood dragon was a violent shock all over the body, uttered a hiss that spread across tens of thousands of miles, and could not stop the collapse of the body, turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes, fell down, and from a distance, the sky and earth had been dyed red yellow spring.
Even at this moment, the blood dragon collapsed, from its mouth came a completely different voice from the roar! "Sorrow... "
At the top of the altar, in the center, sat cross-knee an old man in a purple robe, his face wrinkled and covered with brown spots, his eyes open in a murmur, but his eyes were dim and obviously blind.
In front of him lay a complete spine, emitting a white awn, and in his right hand he held a stone tablet, resting on the 13th spine.
His empty eyes looked at the sky silently, for a long time, for a long time, a long sigh.
In his words, the right hand holding the stone tablet moved again on the strange backbone, rubbing the bones of the animal, uttered a click and click sound, scattered towards the distance, his figure was obviously bleak, and with this voice, revealed a sad loneliness and decline.
Late at night, it was dark, but the mountains were not calm, fierce animals infested, the roar of the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, the leaves rustled down.
There was another roar of animals, and Lin Feng shrunk his neck, dusted the leaves that fell on his body, looked at the mountains in the dark, and sighed in his heart that this place was really different from the earth.
Lin Feng sat under a tree in a daze, opposite several husky teenagers looked at him with disdainful eyes, a little fat man shouted at Lin Feng: "Leaving you a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat, work quickly! "
Lin Feng came to his senses and didn't say anything. He patted his buttocks and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man groaned, "Useless waste, not even a child's strength, should be thrown into the mountains to be eaten by the monster! "
Lin Feng curled his mouth, brother, a man who came across the earth, how can he compare his physical strength with your herd of animals?
This Tianyuan world is a world dominated by cultivators of the truth.
At present, this wolf village is just a small village in the mountains, and naturally there are no cultivators, but every villager practices martial arts skills and strength, even women and children are no exception.
Only in this way can we survive in a world where monsters are rampant and even ancient relics are infested.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong people in the village also have to go hunting in the mountains, many prey are used to going out at night, although it is dangerous to go into the mountains at night, but the harvest will be greater.
The people in the village have become accustomed to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village do not sleep, so they get together to play and wait for their adults to return from hunting.
He also dragged a child with a clean snot, and indifferently played with dozens of hundreds of jin of stone locks as toys, while a group of teenagers were trying to see who could lift a giant ding that weighed a thousand jin at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at the herd of small animals and sighed, comparing his strength with them, he really looked like a waste of firewood.
But this didn't make Lin Feng feel frustrated. Although he was discussed behind him from time to time, he still stayed in this small mountain village called Wolf Village with his ability to trick. What really hurt him was that there was one more thing in his mind.
Super Master System.
At first, Lin Feng was happy, thinking that crossing is welfare, but the first system explanation made him half-hearted.
"The main task of the system: the host opens the mountain to establish a faction, establish the world's first major gate, become the first ancestral master. "
"The main task is divided into different stages, each stage needs to be completed within a limited time, the timeout is not completed, directly erase the host!"
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence "Erase the host," speechless for a long time, and finally squeezed out a few words from the teeth: "I bought a watch last year!"
After the anger, Lin Feng helplessly read the content of the task, he is not ready to risk challenging the system, to see if the other party can erase him in the end, just came to this world, the ass is not hot, he does not want to die again.
Main task 1.0 - Receiving four students who pass on the mantle.
Mission Statement: Even if you are a casual practitioner and want to pass on your mantle, you should also accept apprentices. The most important resource of a school is always people, who are the heirs of talented students.
Time limit: one year, overtime is not completed, directly erase the host.
"Pit Dad! "Lin Feng sighed, we just passed through the newcomer, young like a refreshing cabbage, I should quickly find a big bull as a master, a good hug on the thighs?
System elder brother, you give me a secret at any rate, so that I can accept an apprentice, this poor and white, what do you want me to teach people?
What's more, the system said that there was a novice gift package, but told himself that the gift package system failure, the novice gift package was delayed, so that Lin Feng lamented that there is no most pit father, only more pit father.
The exchange system opened, but all kinds of good things are full of dazzling, magical treasures, magical practices, only you can't think of it, without him there is no stock.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng doesn't have even one exchange point at the moment, so he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was swearing at his mother in his heart, and suddenly there was a commotion at the entrance of the village, which seemed to be the return of the hunting team.
The young people waiting in the village cheered and went to the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced at them indifferently, but was amazed to find that all the young and strong people who had returned from the hunt had returned empty-handed, with no prey to say, and even their weapons were missing.
For these villagers, weapons are a second life, and living in this mountain, they can't live without weapons.
Lin Feng's mouth aroused an imperceptible smile: "There seems to be a story. "Thinking of this, he also walked to the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before approaching, I heard someone shouting, "Wolf wind is the hope of our wolf village, and now I've been seriously wounded by the people of Stone Village, I can't give up! "
When Lin Feng looked up, he saw a teenager in the middle of the crowd sitting on the ground with a shriveled look, covered with bruises, and his eyes were a cold light of hatred.
"This is the genius that was talked about by the people of Wolf Village?" Lin Feng stealthily observed, for this wolf wind, he is also famous for a long time, the idol of the whole Wolf Village teenagers, is regarded as the hope of the village, today Lin Feng is the first time to meet a real person.
Although the wolf wind was wounded in the body and looked weak, it was full of qi and blood, and although the physical strength could not be compared with that of the cultivators, it was absolutely the top among the worldly warriors.
According to the public theory of the Tianyuan Great World, there is this level at a young age, and if you cultivate the truth and practice qi, there will be a future for development, and the truth cultivator, in the final analysis, is to guide the spirit of heaven and earth into the body, condense the power of mana, and strengthen his own foundation.
Lin Feng quietly tuned out his super ancestor system, which has a disciple talent detector, he pressed the confirmation to the wolf wind.
"The qualification of this object is too low to become a disciple of the host. "
Lin Feng frowned, and the system was too picky. He wanted to take in four students at random first, to fool through the one-year time limit of the system, and in the end, it was a big deal to drive the students who made up the number out of the door.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to drill the loopholes in the system, even such a talented young man as Lung Feng is not qualified, Lin Feng wants to collect all four students to complete the system tasks, it is too difficult.
"A year, a year... "Lin Feng sighed gloomily.
In the crowd, an old man beside Wolf Wind looked pale and hummed, "Wolf Wind is my grandson, of course, this matter can't be forgotten like this, but not now. There has been a lot of movement in the mountains in recent days, it seems that there is a mountain treasure to be born, first get the mountain treasure, and then settle accounts with Shicun!"
There are often fights between rural clans, Lin Feng is not interested in this, but the word "Shan Bao" into his ears, let his heart move a little.
Lin Feng was thinking about mountain treasures when he suddenly heard someone in the crowd swearing in a low voice, "I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster, less than four years old, a little doll, can defeat the talented wolf wind of our village, it's a damn thing!"
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lighted up.
The little doll, less than four years old, defeated the wolf wind in front of him?
The wolf wind is already a bit of a talent, the person who hurt him is not even four years old, what kind of talent should be?
The little fat man next to Lin Feng shouted in a low voice, "Damn the little devil, I must kill him! "
After looking at him, Lin Feng agreed, "Yes, yes. "
In my heart, I thought that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd, and now he would like to fly to Stone Village with wings, but he dare not go out of the village alone, otherwise he would have to eat for the monsters in the mountains.
At this moment, the mechanically dull beep suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"Newbie gift package released, do you want to check it immediately?"
Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, and was overjoyed. He had never thought the dull and dull system prompt was so melodious.
Find a place where no one else is, and Lin Feng opens the gift bag.
Beginner's Package: The host gets the basic training as the four-level state of the Qi training period, gets a lottery opportunity, gets 300 points to redeem, gets the Taoist secret "Nine Days of Thunder" and gets the nine-day power of the Gods.
Lin Feng was stunned, and a warm current fell from the top of his head, running straight through his chest and abdomen, quickly breaking through a hidden acupuncture point in his body.
There are twelve important acupuncture knacks hidden in the human body, which are called the twelve-fold building by cultivators.
The cultivation during the qi practice period is divided into twelve levels, in order to open the twelve-fold building. When each acupuncture knack is opened, the aura will be transformed into mana, and the mana of the practitioner will rise to a step.
Lin Feng now feels a warm current of continuous victories, and walks all the way until he gets through the four acupuncture points in his body before disappearing. As Lin Feng breathes, the energy of the outside world is quickly inhaled into his body, circling in the four acupuncture points that have been opened.
Each acupuncture point is like a constantly running star cluster universe, the aura is constantly transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just as the universe is beginning to open, the evolution of all living things.
Lin Feng felt that his whole body was becoming lighter, his mind was moving, his mana was surging like a spring, and his explosive power was ready to move.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and was relieved: "At last, I have a little self-preservation power." But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system is to build the first gate in history, he wants to become the first ancestor in history, Lin Feng was under great pressure and hurried to check other things in the novice package.
"Raffle chances?" Lin Feng looked at it, in addition to the exchange system in the auxiliary training system, there is a lottery system, but it is gray, is still not activated, do not think about it for the time being.
At present, I can only hope that the purchasing power of the 300 exchange points is higher.
While thinking, Lin Feng entered the exchange system, before he was so poor, he didn't have the heart to look at the price.
After carefully looking at the price, Lin Feng insulted the system black-hearted, the lowest-level bottle of Yangqi Dan, 10 exchange points, a slightly spiritual iron-making sword for 30 points.
Even if I want to get a basic outfit, a feather coat and a star crown, it costs 50 points.
The most basic magical powers, such as "fireball" and "thunder in the palm of the hand," cost a hundred points.
As for the high-end goods with a series of zeros hanging on the back of the buttocks, Lin Feng did not dare to look at it for fear of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the poor 300 in his "existing exchange points" column and shook his head: "The start-up capital is too little. "
Luckily, the novice gift package opened a book of Taoist secrets and a magic power, otherwise Lin Feng would really be blind.
Taoism is the foundation of practice, mainly to improve the state, while the divine power is a practical martial arts or magic with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the quality of the Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa in the gift package is very high, the existing exchange system can not even be exchanged, must be upgraded before the exchange.
As for the system upgrade, it needs Lin Feng to complete a certain number of system tasks before it will open, it is still very early.
The Jiuxiao Tianlei Fa-rectification is one of the top Lei Dao Fas in this Tianyuan world, but it has been lost for many years, and the elders who practiced successfully in the past were all big bulls walking sideways with this Dao Fa.
According to the instructions, the novice gift package is randomly opened a way, can open the Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa, Lin Feng is the ancestral tomb smoke, 300 exchange points although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng at this time the heart of the depression swept away.
With such a top-level Dao Fa, if there weren't that damn main task, Lin Feng would have found a place where no one else could practice God Gong and then come out to kill people everywhere.
But now that I'm going to take in apprentices, that's another way of saying it.
Dissatisfaction is dissatisfaction, Lin Feng quickly adjusted the state of mind, and acted quickly.
He quietly asked for the way to the village, and then left the village without disturbing others.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility, and Lin Feng, who has become a true cultivator, is not afraid of the people of Wolf Village, but he is afraid that they will reveal their identity in front of the people of Shicun.
Luckily, now the people of the wolf village gather at the entrance of the village, because there is a lot of discussion about the injury of the wolf wind, Lin Feng went out from the back of the village, no one noticed his actions.
Walking on the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate to directly invest in 50 exchange points to buy a suit for himself.
How could Lin Feng from the earth not know the principle of "Buddha needs gold, people need clothes"? If you want to sell things, publicity and packaging must first be done well.
Looking down at his feathers and star crowns, white robes with wide sleeves, a fairy wind and bones to get the image of a master, Lin Feng nodding with satisfaction, the system is expensive, but the quality is really not to say.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing he saw was half a huge piece of dead wood, the trunk was ten meters in diameter, and the whole body was black.
Lin Feng looked at it and speculated that it was a lightning-struck tree that had been struck by lightning many years ago, destroying the huge crown and vigorous vitality of the old tree, and now only a stump eight or nine meters high was left on the surface.
But just looking at the size of the existing tree trunks, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead trees were blackened, and there was no sign of life.
At this time, an old man came up and coughed and said, "This tree has withered for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng and looked at Lin Feng up and down with a pair of eyes, "The little old man is the head of the village, I don't know what can help the head of the road?"
Lin Feng smiles, his body naturally exudes a dusty and arrogant atmosphere, and then matched with a dress, white robes with wide sleeves, feather coat with a star crown, the appearance is not picky at all, absolutely world-class.
"Discovering the goal, suitable to become a disciple of the host. "
Lin Feng was just about to speak when he heard the sudden sound of the system prompt and almost choked on his mouth.
The old village chief of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but he shivered.
Lin Feng's eyes were green, staring at the entrance of the village like a starving wolf.
At the entrance of the village, a pink-carved jade peck, a snow-white cute child, is pulling the tail of a rhubarb dog, the child's voice is crisp and loud: "Babbling, don't run! "
Lin Feng's system sound in his mind is non-stop: "The talent system is finished, the No. 1 target information is as follows. "
"Roots and bones - >10; understanding - >8; mind - >8; happiness - >8."
"Summary: the goal is very talented, it is recommended to earn under the door, carefully teach, will be the backbone of the door. "
Lin Feng didn't see anything else, so he stared at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
What does 10 root bones mean?
For example, if someone else runs, it takes 100 meters from the beginning to the end, and the end is the same, the little bitch starts from a place of 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder he was less than four years old and could beat the wolf wind with a face full of peach blossoms.
The little bitch also found Lin Feng at this time, looked at him with a dazed face, blinked and blinked big eyes, full of Meng Zhengtai.
Lin Feng smacked his mouth, this product is not only strong to the sky, understanding, aspiration, fortune are also super talented level.
Isn't it a little stressful to accept such a product as an apprentice?
Lin Feng thought, and gradually a warm and sunny smile appeared on his face.
If people who were familiar with Lin Feng in previous lives saw him with such a smile, they would immediately hide as far as they could.
Part 1, Chapter 1
The morning sun, through the light silver veil, fell just on the bed, and stung her eyes so much that she could not open them.
At the party last night, she was so happy that she drank too much, and Lu Yanchen picked her up.
When I sit up, the thin silk is slipping off, a touch of red on the white sheets is revealed, and my body, greasy white skin is covered with kiss marks.
You can see that it is the result of a night of indulging.
"I love you."
When he was in love, his touching love words seemed to be still in his ears. Time was full of peach blossoms, his eyes were shy, and he looked around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt and got out of bed, and when his legs touched the ground, he was weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the light came out again, Lu Yanchen also returned, leisurely and slowly walked into the living room, slender and tall with a strong and oppressive aura.
Time lifts its eyes, and it falls into a pair of deep eyes, eyes quiet as if the unfathomable clear pool.
It was the first time that such an intimate relationship had taken place, and the time was a little shy, and I dared not look at him.
When she was confused, she vaguely heard him say that he wanted to surprise her.
Is it to propose to her?
Time is a little at a loss, the heart plops and beats wildly.
As soon as she spoke, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's silent voice: "Break up! "
What did he just say, break up?
What surprise is he going to give her? Is it a breakup?
Was he teasing her, joking, or really, breaking up?
A scream of extreme pain, hidden in the throat can not be uttered, so half-loud, time to find their voice,
It's very light, as if low to the dust. "Break up, after we have sex..., Lu Yanchen, what do you mean? "
Lu Yanchen's cold expression did not change a bit, "Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who held me tightly and asked me not to stop, last night you also enjoyed it. "
Time is as stunned as lightning!
She was speechless, looked at the man who was completely different from what she remembered, shivered uncontrollably, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why? "
After saying that, he turned and looked out of the window, with a faint smile on his lips.
In the eyes of time, that smile looks like a mockery.
Time's face was as white as snow, the pain started from the heart, pressed the nerve endings to the four limbs, the dizzy darkness struck, her fingertips tightly pinched the palms, did not let herself faint.
The air suddenly became cold and bitterly moist, making people shiver and suffocate, making them unable to stay for a minute.
Time is gone.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Rain country, Cangyun town Lingjia, the moon is over the middle of the day.
It took Ling Han a whole ten seconds to finally be sure that he was indeed reincarnated.
For a strong man in nature, it takes ten seconds to be sure of something, which is absolutely unbelievable, but it also proves how unbelievable what happened to him.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and had unprecedented achievements in Dan Dao, the art of "three fires" initiated a revolution in the alchemy world, and was revered as "Dan Emperor."
But he was not satisfied, and wanted to go one step further, to reach the legendary emptiness, to break the emptiness, to become a god. To this end, he visited countless historical sites, and finally entered the Valley of Black Blood, where he found a mysterious ancient pagoda after many dangers.
He was not disappointed, but the golden text on the ancient pagoda was a supreme exercise called the "Immortality of the Heavenly Book." If you practice to the highest level, your body will be immortal, coexist with the heavens and the earth, and live with the sun and the moon!
However, even though I practiced martial arts in the cold weather, I still felt that the "Eternal Book" was obscure and difficult to understand, as if I were reading a book of heaven, and I had no clue at all.
When he wrote down this exercise by force, and wanted to study the ancient pagoda, the ancient pagoda vibrated lightly, releasing an immeasurable light that shattered his physical body in an instant. But strangely, his soul did not dissipate, and fell into a state that seemed to wake up, not to wake up, not to dream, and lasted for ten thousand years.
During these 10,000 years, his soul has been thinking about the immortal heavenly scriptures - he can't do anything else, and after 10,000 years, he finally comprehended the first level of this practice.
It takes 10,000 years for a strong person in the world of nature and man to comprehend the first state of a practice. What is this concept?
You should know that those who are strong in the world of nature and man generally have a lifespan of less than a thousand years, and normally speaking, no one in the world can cultivate this immortal heavenly sutra, because they will die of old age before they have even started.
But Ling Han mastered the first level of the practice of the Undead Tianjing in this strange way, and then he suddenly came to life and was reincarnated in a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"Whatever it is, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only the second level of cultivation of the body, waste material can not be waste material, but I was once a strong person in the world of nature and man, stood at the top of the martial arts, and was a master of Dan Dao, poor qualifications to use Dan medicine to make up for, I don't believe can not return to the peak."
"Besides, I can finally practice the Celestial Sutra without destroying it, this is a supreme practice, even... may not be owned by the mortal world, but from the legendary divine world, otherwise how can it take 10,000 years to understand the first practice?"
"In this life, I will surpass the predecessors and achieve the position of God!"
"Also, what is the matter with this body? I only cultivated to the second level of the body at the age of sixteen, is it because today's martial arts is too withered? "
Boom, countless memories poured into my mind, this is the memory of another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people also fused together, indistinguishable.
"I understand."
Ling Han nods in his mind, the reason why he is only in the second level of the body is that his spiritual roots are too poor.
If you want to cultivate to become a warrior, there is a prerequisite, that is, you must have a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, you can absorb the spirit of the heavens and the earth, harden your body, and become your own strength.
Some spiritual roots absorb aura quickly, while others are slow, so the spiritual roots are divided into four major levels of heaven and earth, and each major level is divided into three small levels, with the upper, middle and lower levels being the best and the lower levels being the yellow.
The key to judging the quality of the spiritual root is purity, the more pure the better, while Ling Han's spiritual root is both the five elements and the most chaotic, in the martial arts world this is the most inferior spiritual root, counted as the yellow-level inferior can only be said to be reluctant, so he is now 16 years old but only cultivated to the second level of the body, while his peers have reached the fourth and fifth levels of the body.
In the past, Ling Han was the spiritual root of the heavens, but also the spiritual root of the nine yang fire, plus no one can match the talent of Dan Dao, with Dan to assist the martial arts, only took only two hundred years to reach the world of nature and man, this is an unprecedented record.
"This is the lowest spiritual root of the Five Elements, no wonder the predecessor, although incomparable efforts, only the second level of cultivation of the body. ""For me, the Five Elements of the Five Elements, although a bit difficult, but with the addition of Dan medicine, I will certainly be able to return to the peak in 400 years at most!"
"Huh!"
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, and his face showed an incredibly shocked expression. He was stunned for a while, and with a strong soul, he looked inside at his spiritual roots in Dantian, and his shocked expression turned into ecstasy.
"This is not the Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root, the Five Elements are completely balanced, forming a Dao lotus! This is the Five Elements Chaos lotus, the best of the best, more rare than the Jiuyang Fire Spirit Root, can be called the God-level Spirit Root!" "The predecessor cultivation is slow, because the God-level Spirit Roots need special exercises to play a real power."
"And I... just mastered a five-element celestial gong matching the five-element chaotic lotus! "
"A hundred years! No, it only takes fifty years, and I can reach the world of nature and man again!"
Rao couldn't help but show his joy at the cultivation of the heavenly and human world in Ling Han's previous life, and his spiritual roots were born to be doomed and can't be changed the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, he visited countless historical sites in order to break the void and become a god, and received a lot of mysteries and practices, of which the Five Elements of Celestial Gong is one.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and in this life, he will create new glory and create an immortal myth.
"How did he die?"
Ling Hanfan picked up the memory, and soon he showed his anger.
Formerly, he was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family, and his mother and grandparents died very early. The Ling family is a martial arts family, and every member of the clan practices martial arts and respects martial arts.
Because of the problem of spiritual roots, Ling Han was regarded as a waste material from a young age, and ate up the white eyes.
In order to give his son a bright future, Ling Dongxing and Huyang College reached an agreement that Huyang College would recruit Ling Han as a disciple and train him fully, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter the Purple Light Valley to find a long-lost thing for Huyang College.
Huyang College was built and run by the Emperor of the Rain Kingdom, with countless resources, and if it is fully cultivated, even the waste material can be promoted to the Yuanyuan Realm.
But the people at Huyang College can't be idiots. If it's easy to get, how can they offer such good conditions?
The Valley of Purple Light is full of dangers, and a wrong step could kill you, but for his son, Ling Dongxing set out seven days ago without turning back.
Yesterday, people from Huyang College came and informed the Ling family that they would pick them up today as agreed. But at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the grand deacon of the Ling family, came to discuss with his predecessor and asked him to give up this precious place to his grandson, Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with an infinite future, and such an opportunity should not be wasted on a waste material.
Naturally, the predecessor would not agree, this is his father's life in exchange for the opportunity! But Ling Chongkuan said it was a discussion, in fact, only to inform the predecessor, did not take his opinion to heart.
The predecessor could not bear to shoot, but Ling Chongquan is a strong gatherer, a finger can suppress him, is he an adversary?
With just one blow, the former was seriously injured and then shut up in his room, obviously not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people at Huyang College.
And the predecessor of the severe wound was so angry and died.
Ling Han groaned, it's really a deception, his father sacrificed his life in exchange for this quota, was taken away by Ling Chongquan's grandson?
This pair of shameless dogs!
I can't bear it!
He got up from the bed and felt sore all over his body--he was alive, but the wounds on his body would not be invincible.
"Linggen is also traumatized!" Ling Han frowned, Ling Chongquan that blow caused damage to his spiritual root, and Linggen was traumatized, this is a very troublesome thing, ordinary healing stone is ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of Dan medicine that can repair Linggen, but the four materials needed are too expensive, even if I sell the whole Lingjia can not be exchanged - moreover, my Linggen is only lightly damaged, do not need such advanced Dan medicine."
"The remaining three, two need to be refined into Dan, with my current cultivation of the second layer of the body is too reluctant. Then there is only one choice - Yuanxin Fuling Powder, only need to proportion the herbs, boiled into medicinal juice. "
"Heal the wound first, and then to stop the heavy-handed grandpa and grandson, although I am not rare this quota, but must not let the father in exchange for the opportunity to cheapen this shameful grandpa and grandson! "
He sat down on his knees and began to operate the "Non-Destruction of the Heavenly Book."
This is the first time he has run this practice, which may be a divine practice, but since he has been thinking about it for tens of thousands of years, he is now taking it easy.
The humming, his body immediately aroused strong vitality, a lot of energy was depleted, but the injury was quickly recovered.
In just a few minutes, he was completely gone.
"It's worthy of not destroying the heavenly sutra, and I've just started to practice cultivation and have such a wonderful effect. It's just that this is completely different from other practices, the normal practice is to use the spiritual roots to transform the spirit of heaven and earth into the energy, but not destroying the heavenly sutra is the opposite, to quench the energy of the body, and can heal injuries."
"After practicing to the highest state, it is not impossible not to die and not to die." "So it can be called the Celestial Book!" "It's a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I can repair the spiritual roots with the Celestial Book."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked out the window at the whitening sky, and muttered, "Now, it's time to go to Ling Chongquan that faceless old goods, to give him a surprise. "
He put on his shoes, went to the door, and opened the door.
At the door, a tall figure immediately appeared blocking his way, named Zhang Yuan, one of the heavy and wide stooges.
"Master Han, the chief deacon ordered you to stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan said with a hey-hey laugh, although the man on the opposite side was the son of the master of the house, but he was a famous waste material, in his eyes it was a joke.
Ling Han's eyes were cold and he said, "Do you dare to stop me?"
The chief deacon said, "You must not let Ling Han make trouble today, and if necessary, you can be beaten! Zhang Yuanpi said with a smile, "This is the order of the chief deacon, and please Master Han don't make me difficult."
Ling Chongkuan, the old dog, was really cautious, and he was still uneasy about beating him to a serious injury, and he sent someone to guard the door, which also shows how important it was for Ling Chongkuan to let his grandson enter Huyang College - but when this hope was dashed, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and annoyance could be imagined.
"Get out of here! "Ling Han coldly said.
Slap it!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped it in the face, coldly saying, "What are you, can't you roll? "
What, he was slapped by a waste material? Zhang Yuan caressed his face in disbelief, the waste material dared to shoot him, and also hit him, what kind of joke is this?
Slap it!
Ling Han waved again and slapped him solidly.
"Baa - baa - baa - "
The sound of a sonic goat bleating reverberated in the silent mountains.
Li climbed up the hill in the seventh night, the night wind was sharp and cold, but he was so anxious that he was sweating. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the hills with his hands and feet, and the night looked very pitiful and horrible.
Although the night looked horrible, Li Qiyue's heart was burning with anxiety.
Li Qiye, he came from a family of tenant farmers, his parents are poor people, he began to herd sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herded the sheep as usual, but when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that one sheep was missing, which made him very anxious. He hurried back to the hills to look for it, but he searched the whole hills and couldn't find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of the landlord of Zhangdahu and the loss of a sheep, Li Qiyue was very anxious and uneasy.
Now the whole hill had been searched, and there was no trace of the sheep. At this time, Li Qiyue thought of one place, but there was only one place he didn't look for - the Fairy Cave!
Looking up at the night in the valley in front of him, he looked like a wild animal, opening his big mouth and choosing people to eat at any time, hearing the sound of wolves crying and ghosts in his ears, and looking out over the blurred night in the fairy cave, Li Qiyue shuddered.
The Fairy Cave, a notorious place in the area, is said to have a demon living in it, and anyone who enters it will be eaten, and no one ever comes out alive.
However, at this time, Zhang Dahu's cracking whip reverberated in Li Qiye's ear, and if he lost a sheep, Zhang Dahu would surely beat his skin to pieces!
"Okay, okay, okay, the immortal crow of this seat is finally refined, only lack of soul, today just borrow your soul to use! "I do not know how long, the fairy cave sounded a deep and gloomy voice.
"Pat--Pat--Pat--"After a while, a sudden flapping of wings sounded, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of the fairy cave.
"Fly, fly, this seat should remember the burial place with your soul, fly over the relics, as long as the Nine Realms are still there, this seat must be found!" In the fairy cave, the deep and gloomy voice reverberated.
Since then, between the sky and the earth, there is a crow flying, into the burial place, into the fairy city, across the evil region...
Time goes by, times change, one invincible character rises, one giant falls after another. Slowly, I don't know when **, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow out of the captivity, began to find the way to control their own destiny.
From the God of Medicine, to the Flying Fairy, then to the Blood Seal Fairy, then to the Mingren Fairy, then to the Swallowing Sun Fairy, then to the Ice Feather Fairy... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants rise, generations of gods fall away, but across tens of thousands of years, the crow still looming in the long river of time.
The wind is as cold as a knife, and the snow is flying.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw himself sitting in a yellow and gray carriage, the carriage was shaking, and there was a little girl talking softly beside him.
Outside the car, there was a lot of noise and noise. There were shouts, shouts, and cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back. He was an old man who ate and died in a state-owned enterprise, and after getting drunk, he woke up in this world.
It's been five days now.
He sniffed, and the air smelled of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit.
"Alas, the white cinnamon wine in the Osmanthus Fang is getting fragrant, "said the maid in the car with a milky voice.
Plus, she's born with a baby face, and she's small. She looks like a ten-year-old.
The little face is chubby, red and white, wearing a green cotton skirt, and the little hands are still rubbing the hairline for Lu Sheng to get off the car and tie his hair.
This hairline is made of a very expensive cross-bark, will naturally give off a light fragrance, but the only disadvantage is that it will be hard in cold weather, you need to rub it with hot hands to soften.
Lusheng smiled and didn't say anything. The carriage stopped quickly.
He lifted the curtain and got out of the car, and the gray streets were paved with blue stone bricks, each the size of a basin.
Cars came and went on the street, and there were people leading horses to and fro. The hawkers and the girls and female family members who came out to hang out were not shy, and they were showing their faces and laughing.
Lu Sheng looked up at the wine shop in front of him. The white plaque was rectangular, with three big characters written in the middle: Osmanthus Flower Shop.
"Inside, please! I'll keep the A-size box for you! "A boy with a smiling face came up.
Lu Sheng nods, a rich boy makes a pie, from the side of the small hand to take the silver edge of the white paper fan, a light shake, the fan face unfolded, on the top of the painting is a picture of the mountains and rivers, the mountains and rivers one after another, the light and dark overlap, and a look is the inscription of everyone's style.
He was familiar with the road and followed the boy into the wine shop.
The restaurant is divided into two floors, and a lot of people are sitting in the hall on the first floor listening to music.
A girl in green was standing in the open, her voice soft, and beside her was a middle-aged woman playing the pipa.
The song is a biography of the Three Huis, which tells of the sad and beautiful love between the general and the fox girl in the mountains.
Unfortunately, the drinkers were all coarse people, only a few literati could understand, and the rest of them turned a blind eye to the girl.
Lu Sheng stopped and saw how busy the first floor was, so he simply found a seat on the first floor.
"Who ordered the three-way pass-through? "he asked the boy casually.
His status in this osmanthus blossom shop is different, if this osmanthus blossom shop is equivalent to the high-end entertainment club on Earth, then he is the supreme vip customer here.
Such an expense, in a small city like Jiuliancheng in the north, is already a top customer.
"It's Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou is missing Mr. Zhou."
Lu Sheng didn't bother him, so he waved him off.
After he sat down with Xiao Qiao, he glanced around the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale, thin boy, dressed in white, holding a golden lotus-leaf folding fan in his hand, gently rocking.
"I guess I saw the little girl singing again. "Lu Sheng shook his head.
"The big boy warned him last time, this guy is really a bad guy! "Xiao Xiao puffed his mouth and complained.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. He began to listen to the music quietly.
On the dark red wooden table, a table of wine and vegetables was quickly served, and Lusheng put a piece of fried meat with lettuce in his mouth.
Take a sip of white cinnamon wine, which is similar to a drink. The sweet, sweet, floral fragrance is mixed together, just like drinking juice.
This North Syracuse, ice shrimp is a speciality here, in the thick ice holes at will, you can fish a large number of translucent shrimp.
The iced shrimp is half the length of ordinary shrimp, but it tastes delicious.
Of course, the price is also very expensive.
It's a luxury for ordinary people to eat once a month, and there's always a meal like his.
Lu Sheng ate the food, drank the wine, and listened to the melody, but his mind was thinking of other things.
He has been in this world like ancient China for so many days, but according to his observation, there are many strange things in this world.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but later he found out he was not.
The customs and festive climate here were far different from any of the dynasties he knew.
Thought of things, the door of the wine shop opened again.
A group of strong men in shorts came in one after another and sat down at a table near the corner.
These strong men were not locals at first sight, they dressed more like they came from the Central Plains, and their clothes and temperament were not as coarse as those in the North.
The man in the head was a bald-headed man with brass earrings and a face full of flesh, but he sighed. "
"The elder brother is worried about something, Lijiacun can't pass, we can take the second road, from Zhangcun to make a detour is also OK, "the other man frowned.
"You know what, when I came to meet you, I went from Zhangcun. The situation is similar to Lijiacun, a lot of people died. "
"What's the matter, brother, you tell the brothers to listen to it, and let us improve our knowledge. "A man urged.
The bald-headed man sighed again. "I don't know what the specifics are, but I know that several fishing villages near Suiyang Lake have had accidents, as if they were haunted by water spirits. "
"Isn't it?"
Lusheng's table was not far from them, and they could be heard talking undisguisedly.
Originally, he was just listening and playing, but I didn't expect that these people were even talking about God's way of things.
His life's road family was one of the best in the Northland Ice City, and his family was rich.
If you compare it on the earth, it is at least the rich people with assets of more than 100 million.
In the past few days, when he went out to drink, he heard a lot of rumors about monsters and spirits in the winery, but most of them were legends.
This was the first time that these people had had such a personal experience. So Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
Luckily, the people didn't hide it. They continued to talk loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"The water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes, more than a foot tall, with green face and tusks, covered with a lot of water weeds, obedient, if it were not for your big brother I run fast, now you would not want to see me. "
"Big brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost? "A man did not believe.
"I'm afraid it's not the story you made up, is it?"
Lu Sheng was also amused to hear this, and I guess it was just a braggart who came out of nowhere to brag. He's seen a lot of people like this during this time.
After eating and drinking, he asked the boy to take the song list of the girl and skim it at will.
Although the three-meeting biography is good, but not for the occasion, he plans to change it to a cheerful one.
Slap it!
But just then, the bald-headed man turned red and slapped the table.
"The bone that the water spirit fell on the ground! I picked it up secretly afterward! "
He carefully took out a green stone like jade from his arms and slapped it on the table.
"Isn't this a piece of jade? "A man laughed.
"Miscellaneous jade? Is this mixed jade?
"This brother. Could you show me this thing? "
All of a sudden, a mild voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of several people with a smile on his face, looking at the green jade on the table.
"Dare you dare to take this thing? It's something left by the water ghost. "The bald head said in surprise.
He's putting it on show now, and he's going to throw it away in a minute.
After all, it's not a thing left behind by people. If the water spirits are really attracted to make trouble, it's really not worth the loss.
"I'll take a look. "Lu Sheng doesn't believe in water ghosts, just looking at the jade sells well, not like ordinary jade.
You should know that common jade, can be bought everywhere in the store stalls, is jade scraps polished at will, the price is extremely cheap.
But I don't know how, as soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
Tsing Yi is a white fox, wearing a sapphire hat and black cloud-pattern boots with silver thread embroidered.
All the clothes can be spent in this osmanthus blossom shop for several months. Even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
"The boy wants it, it's not impossible, well... a silver or two is fine! "
Lusheng asked Xiaoxiao to take out a couple of pieces of silver and put them on the table.
The bald head resolutely picked up the jade and went to the road to win the hand. Several people changed their eyes, got up and left.
Lu Sheng did not say anything, but saw several people leave, holding the jade in his hand, took it up and looked at it carefully.
"It's just that I've been so rich in my life." He shook his head, and a silver or two was nothing to him. According to the body's memory, his monthly expenses were at least a hundred silver or more. Occasionally, they might cost a thousand silver or more.
When he thought of this, he secretly thought of the loser.
Holding the jade, he ignored the sight of the guests watching the festivities around him, but left the winery with a small foot and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But just out of the wine shop, he didn't walk halfway, he suddenly stunned, took the jade and put it in his hand.
The jade was in his hand, in the palm of his right hand, and it melted.
The original hard stone, in just a few seconds, turned into a mass of dark green mucus, the mucus faintly heard a scream.
The whole mucus suddenly exploded, turned into a cloud of green smoke, and slowly drifted away from Lusheng.
He stood where he was in amazement and saw that the jade was still in his hands, but the green inside had faded away.
He stood in a daze, constantly recalling the scenes before.
Xiao Qiao kept calling him on the side.
Lu Sheng returned to his mind, and then looked at the jade in his hand, it was an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
"Get out of here and go home!"
When they got into the carriage, the driver took up his whip and gave it a few strokes, and the two black horses with hair all over them began to walk slowly.
In the car, Lu Sheng said nothing, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hands. Xiao Xiao also found the strangeness of the stones.
"I've been cheated again!" she muttered to herself, and she didn't say much, but the eldest son was fine this time. The biggest time he was cheated was for a so-called antique wine jug, and he spent thousands of silver, which almost made him angry. This time it was only a silver or two, and the young master sometimes had more than that for a meal.
The carriage went all the way back to the house. Passing the city gate, Lusheng heard someone shouting outside.
..." I heard before that the water ghosts were removed! A traveller's Taoist rescued the danger of the fishing village! "
"Is there anyone from above the court?"
"I came early, and I heard that even the Ouyang headhunter of the prefect's yamen in the city almost fell into it. I was fortunate to meet a cloud traveler, who was said to have a flash of gold when he shot, and the water ghost in the barn screamed, turned into green slime, and then exploded into a thick smoke and dispersed."
"Of course not!"
Lusheng recognized that the officer guarding the city gate was chatting.
He would often pass by the gate on purpose, and the officers and guards were well-informed and liked to brag about strange things everywhere.
"It's a coincidence... "Lu Sheng's face was silent.
He thought of the jade before, and his heart sank.
Autumn of 9999, East China Sea, Qingzhou City.
Qingzhou Academy Palace, the holy place of Qingzhou City, the noble family of Qingzhou City and more than half of the strong people in the family of Qingzhou City, all came out of Qingzhou Academy Palace. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the palace for spiritual practice, once they have the opportunity to enter the school, they will study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone has this awareness. At this time, in a schoolhouse in Qingzhou Academy Palace, a teenager was lying on a table, sleeping soundly.
On top of the lecture hall, a girl in a long Tsing Yi dress also noticed the scene, and with a touch of anger on her face, she walked towards the teenager in her sleep.
Qin Yi, a 17-year-old official disciple of Qingzhou College and a lecturer of students from outside the university, has a beautiful face and a hot figure. In the schoolhouse, a pair of eyes move with Qin Yi's attractive posture, and even if she is angry, Qin Yi's steps are still graceful.
"This guy was sleeping in Qin's lecture hall again. "It seems that he noticed the sleeping posture, and many teenagers around him were speechless, obviously, this is not the first time.
"According to Qin's appearance and figure, even looking at her is pleasing enough, what is in that guy's mind. "
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer, none of them, as for the reason, as long as you see her, you can understand, I do not know how many people regard her as a goddess, her lecture hall is always full of schoolhouses.
Qin Yi's steps were very light, and she didn't make a sound when she came to the boy's side. She stood in front of the table and looked at her sleeping face, her beautiful face covered with frost.
"Ye Futian. "A soft voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seems that when I heard someone calling me in my sleep, Ye Futian's body moved, holding his head with his hands, and he opened his eyes leisurely.
"It's so big. "Ye Futian couldn't help whispering, his voice was very soft, as if talking to himself, but in the quiet environment at the moment, the voice still seemed very abrupt, only for a moment, many eyes frozen in the air, and then turned into anger.
"How dare he... openly belittle Qin Shijie?"
The angry eyes turned into a sword, causing Ye Futian to shiver, as if he felt something was wrong, his eyes moved up the attractive place, and then he saw a face as delicate as jade, but full of anger.
"Eh... "Ye Futian has a black line on his face, how is it Qin Yi?
He looked back and saw a pure 15-year-old girl glaring at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, then swore, was killed miserably, no wonder the size is not right.
"Sister Qin Shi, I... "Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian. "Qin Yi interrupted him indifferently, saying, "What is the background of the Qingzhou Academy Palace?"
It is obvious that Qin Yi is to avoid the embarrassment just now, to change the topic, but her anger at the moment, Ye Futian can clearly feel, he even faintly felt the flow of a string of swords from Qin Yi's body, sharp and piercing, stinging every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, the Eastern Phoenix Emperor unified Eastern China and ordered the princes of the world to create the Wufu Academy Palace to prosper martial arts, and the Qingzhou Academy Palace was founded in this context." Ye Futian responded, of course, what he said was a true historical record, and there was another name in the wild history he saw in the family, but the name of the taboo was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the occupations of spiritual practice? "Qin Yi asked again.
"Practicing martial arts can be divided into martial arts and art, there are many professions such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, and so on; practitioners of martial arts have many professions such as mage, dan master, and instrument master, and the mage is divided into many departments, of course, there are also talented people who practice martial arts at the same time."
"You seem to have missed a profession, "Qin Yi asked with a solemn look and seriousness.
The young man's face showed a touch of divine brilliance: "The strongest profession recognized in China, those who have received God's providence, the destiny mage, have God-given talents, those who have rare talents, such as the summoner, the master of the beast, the astrology, the vast majority of them are from the destiny mage, no matter the practice of martial arts, the destiny mage can have stronger talents than others."
Everyone around us is fascinated, the destiny mage, the legendary profession, the destiny, the providence of God's providence. "Not only that, even the destiny mage, is also born suitable for martial arts training. "
Qin Yimu showed longing, then looked at the teenager in front of him, and said angrily, "I didn't expect you to know a lot about this. "
"Of course. "Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said earnestly, "I am a destiny master."
"Puff... "Nearby, a teenager who was drinking water choked violently, coughing violently, and a pair of eyes around him looked at Ye Futian, as if looking at an idiot.
Is there such a shameless person in the world, worthy of being a legendary figure of the Qingzhou Academy, who not only openly teases Qin Shijie, but now falsely claims to be a destiny master, in order to attract the attention of Qin Shijie?
However, who is he, who has been practicing in the palace for three years, has been lingering in the first state of awakening, the body is weak, obviously the body has not completed the exercise, such a mediocre and even can be called a waste of firewood, saying that he is a destiny mage?
Qin Yi's chest rises and falls again, and she looks at Ye Futian angrily: "Since you are the master of destiny, the natural palace of destiny has a soul, release the soul of your palace of destiny for me to see. "
"My soul is still sleeping, and I can't call it out, and I fell asleep in the lecture hall because of my soul, "Ye Futian calmly responded.
"Ye Futian... "Qin Yi suddenly shouted, staring at the teenager in front of him with beautiful eyes, saying: "Three years ago, you entered the palace at the age of twelve, when I was a foreign disciple, visited your talent test, your perception of the aura as a heavenly product, shocked the palace, many teachers paid attention to, but in the past three years, there has been no progress, always stay in the first re-energized state of awakening, do nothing all day long, lazy, absent-minded in the lecture hall, have you ever practiced? "
"In the past three years, whether it is the Spring Festival or the Autumn Festival, you all abstained, directly ranked first from the bottom of the school, Ye Futian, do you have the heart of shame? "
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the whole schoolhouse became silent, the falling needle could be heard, the eyes of all the people stared at Qin Yi's excited face, as if this was the first time they had seen Qin Shijie like this.
Ye Futian also seemed to be restrained, his dark eyes staring at the delicate face red with anger in front of him.
"Three years. "Ye Futian whispered in his heart, but I didn't realize that it had been three years, and the guy in the Ming Palace, still hasn't changed at all, and he was a little unexpected, the iceberg sex goddess Qin Shijie, who has always been indifferent, had been paying attention to him, from the year he stepped into the school to test the perception of the talents of heavenly products has begun.
The space was dead and silent, Qin Yimei stared at the young man in front of her, with a handsome face with clear lines, clean and deep eyes as bright as stars, and at the age of 15, she could not find any other faults except her thin body, and in three or two years, she would be a beautiful man.
"Is my tone too heavy? "Qin Yi saw that Ye Futian seemed to feel a little lonely out of the corner of his eyes, and he couldn't help but say in his heart, and his anger dissipated a little.
"There is still a month to the Qiu Yun examination, if you still abstain or do not pass this time, even if you intercede for the rest of your life is useless, the school will not allow you to continue to stay, do you understand?" Qin Yi continued, the people in the schoolhouse stared at the eyes, it seems that the school is intolerable to the guy.
If so, I'm afraid it will be recorded in the history of Qingzhou Academy, after all, it is very rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy.
"He'll go, I'll go. "At the end, an indifferent voice came, and many people looked at the teenager sitting in the corner, with complex eyes, envy, envy, admiration, and fear.
"It has been decided that the rest of his life does not need to participate in next year's Spring Festival, you can choose any of the battle towers of the school, the knights, and the magic palace to practice, his future can no longer be affected by you. "Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, he and the rest of his life's fate will eventually go in a completely different direction.
Ye Futian's mouth outlines a faint smile, a little cynical.
"Shut up... "Sitting in the back, the rest of my life stood up, the eyes were bright and sharp, stabbing at Qin Yi.
"Sit down. "Ye Futian did not turn back, said indifferently, the rest of his life's eyes glazed, looking at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words to him, is an iron order.
"I decided to...... "Ye Futian showed a slightly frivolous smile on his face, looking at Qin Yi and saying, "I officially participated in this year's Autumn Examination."
Behind it, a bright light flashed in the eyes of the rest of my life.
It's been three years, and he's finally serious?
Qingzhou Xuegong has been practicing for three years, and all the people in the school only know that he has a great talent for the rest of his life, a great talent for perception and martial arts, but he can also practice Dharma and martial arts, and although he is a foreign disciple, his level is higher than that of many lecturers.
However, who really knows the sleeping teenager?
"You are weak, still stay in the state of the first re-energization of the awakening, even if you participate in the Autumn Examination, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian, sighing in his heart, even now rise up, I'm afraid it is still too late.
"What if it's over? "Ye Futian seems to have no self-awareness at all, there is a strong confidence in the tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want to do in the lecture hall. "Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed a strange light, looking at the shadow and hot body in front of him, his eyes involuntarily looked at the place where he should not look, and weakly said, "What do you want to do? "
"This guy, what does this mean... "many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where do you look? "It seems to notice Ye Futian's eyes, many people have the impulse to go violently, he even dare to tease Qin Shijie?
Qin Yi naturally also noticed Ye Futian's eyes, the newly born sympathy was instantly lost, the beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian viciously, gnashing teeth and saying: "What you want to do, it's okay! "
Deep mountains and dense forests, thousands of demons gather.
For the first time, all ethnic groups put aside their enmity and resentment and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes, and snakes... all kinds of demons had arrived. For a time, the whole forest was full of all kinds of demons, big or small, delicate or charming. At the top of the head were ten demon kings, the top ten strong in the world of demons, but the same heavy look appeared between their eyebrows.
"Ladies and gentlemen, you must know what happened here recently." The Tigers have always been strong, and the Tiger King was the first to speak to make all the demons quiet down, "We are the same demons, under such a crisis, I think all ethnic groups should throw away their preconceptions, speak together, and solve the current problems together."
"What is the purpose?"
"Do you still have to guess this? "Tiger King groaned coldly, "Apart from those monks in the Six Schools and Three Zongzong, who would do such a thing. Have we had so few demons killed by him in recent years?"
"But we have always had a clear distinction with these cultivators, and why did they suddenly block my way out of the boundary? "Wang Fox looked puzzled.
"I didn't eat the first son of their three families, "the Snake King also guessed, "They don't need to tear their faces like this, do they?"
"Just! "The Leopard King also said indignantly, "I've been like this for so many years, which demon hasn't eaten a mortal, how can the three Zongzong six factions suddenly attack? I don't think they are."
"Yes, everyone knows that the demons of our world are harmful to their cultivation, so they never go near the border forest, and how can they stay here specially? "
"But... except for the six factions and three kings, who has the strength to kill all the demons out of the boundary within three months. "Tiger King still insists on his idea.
The eagle king nods, as if to think of something, the feathers on his body are trembling, "I heard that those demons who went out of the border, all died without bones, there are also those who were skinned and cooked, there are dry corpses on the old shame trees in the forest.
"It's just too much of a bully. "The Tiger King slapped the armrest of the stone chair and stood up angrily. "Ladies and gentlemen, I think instead of guessing who did it, I'd better kill it together and make it clear. I don't believe it, no matter how high they are, they can still stop the army of demons?"
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings immediately showed their expressions of approval, and indeed it was better to take the initiative than to be afraid.
The deer king's head responded, "My son died in their hands, instead of guessing here, I'd better go out and kill them happily. What about the three kings and six factions, we demons were afraid of them! "
"Isn't that why we gather here today? No matter who he is, kill him to avenge the dead of his kind. "Even the least daring King Rabbit stood up and responded, but the Rabbits died the most.
"Yes, this revenge is not retaliated, in vain for the demon!"
"The spirits of the people are above, and I will swear to avenge this. "
Other demon kings also stood up to respond, and even the demons of all ethnic groups on standby around them also showed up, bright claws, excitedly shouted the slogan of revenge, and looked as if the whole army was ready to go.
"What... "a small voice suddenly sounded in the crowd of demons, "I don't think I need to go."
In the wave of indignation, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared. Although it was not loud, it managed to attract the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, all the demons' eyes stabbed at the past.
"Who is it? "The Tiger King even more roared, searching for this speciesless demon.
The demons searched around, obviously the most sensitive demon of the five senses, but they did not find the voice of the person for half a day.
"Who is it that just spoke? "Tiger King was a little angry, "Where is the bastard? There is a kind of stand up for the king!"
"I'm here, here!"
The demons again patrolled around several times, but still did not see who was speaking.
"Here here... "The voice rises again, "Left left, wrong... over, a little on the right, wrong, look here, look here!"
The demons followed the sound and looked around several times, but still couldn't find the person who made the sound.
"Ah! Forget it, I'm here!"
It was not until a sigh that a figure suddenly climbed up on the platform on which the demon king was sitting, using both hands and feet.
It was a woman in a gray robe, her shoulders were weak, her eyes were pulling down, and she had a lazy temperament, she was short and thin, and her face was a little yellow.
The word "weak" came to the minds of all the demons at the same time, too weak! Even the spirit of the demons on her body was so weak that it seemed that any demon could blow her away.
No wonder the demons didn't find this person after looking for him for half a day, such a demon is really too inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King couldn't see it at once, and the Tiger snorted and said, "Hum, you're a seedless boy, only a few monks scared you and made you look like this." All demons can be incarnate, but this is a meeting of demons, so most of the demons here show some archetypes to distinguish races, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the Tiger King even more disdainful, "Dare not to show people in the original form, what are you a demon?" "I'm a human being."
"I'm a human being," the woman answered.
"Shemale? "Tiger King was stunned for a moment, "What is a shemale? I've never heard of it!"
"How can any weak and indiscriminate demon dare to come to the meeting of the demons? "Tiger King stared at the woman indignantly, "You little demon without seed, don't talk nonsense here, affect my morale to wait for revenge."
"No, I'm serious. "The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders were not consciously drooping, appearing weaker, "You really don't need to go out to seek revenge."
"I'm still talking about it! "The Tiger King was angry and shouted, "Believe it or not I ate you a little demon."
"You ate me, and there's no need to go for nothing?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, the guy you just said killed all the demons, the animal is not as good... "She sighed, patted the gray robe and raised her head, still listless, but pointed to her nose and said, "Maybe... it's me!"
There was a silence for three seconds, and there was no sound.
"Kill her!"
The demon, who reacted, rushed at the woman at the same time.
Small animals or something - it's so troublesome!
In five minutes.
- The First and Last Congress of the Monsters is over!
Chapter 1 Tony Dawn?
The huge noise stimulates the nerves of the brain, and the decibel size can cause deafness. A glare of white light enters the eyes, and the sun ** bulges and hurts.
Dawn couldn't help squinting, but the white light didn't fade, but spread to the whole world.
What the hell is this? Am I at the rock concert?
Dawn swore and opened his eyes, but what came into his eyes was a big, scary face. A face full of sweat, black, and the heat from the two black holes under his wide nose seemed to have reached his face. The white teeth in the cracked mouth were as scary as wild animals, and of course there was bad breath coming out of it.
Then there was a violent, head-on collision. Dawn felt as if he had been hit in the chin with a heavy blow and fell backwards.
The weight of the two men fell on the poor plastic bottles, and they disintegrated under the weight of the weight. The water of the white flowers splashed out, and a column of water even shot out of the mouth of one bottle, directly into the face of the "pond fish" behind, and the other "pond fish" rose as if they were frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!"
"Damn it!"
"What is this?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you do it?"
Dawn lay on the ground, staring at the strange faces around him, some of them anxious, some gloating, and some of them covering their faces. There was still a lot of noise, but the loud noise had changed its tune, and there were hisses and laughter.
Where is this? Who are they? What is this?
Wait, let's see what's going on on the sidelines? "The live commentator suddenly became excited, he stood up and looked down from the top bleachers, "Forest's main striker David Johnson was knocked into the sidelines in a fight with the opposing players, poor Coach Tony Downe was standing on the sidelines directing the game... oh! Look at the misery on the ground, it was a real crash of Mars into the Earth!
Dawn lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaking wet, crumpled with grass and dirt, looking like a freshly used rag.
A man with a big nose and black beard, a little like Mario, appeared in his vision, and he quickly took out white gloves from his backpack and put them on, and then began to examine Dawn's body.
Damn it, he seems to have landed on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me? "He stretched out his hand and waved in front of Dawn, his tone much more anxious than it had been.
At the same time, the TV screen began to play the scene again and again.
David Johansson was pushed by his opponent during a fierce fight with No. 14, and the big black man slanted towards Tony Downe on the sidelines. But strangely, Downe could have avoided it, and he had plenty of time, but he stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his teammates crash into him.
The Forest players anxiously gathered around the bench, the center of the crowd was Dawn lying on the ground, and the black striker David Johansson, who had made a mistake, knelt on the ground and prayed. If his coach had something bad or bad, he would be the first player to kill his manager on the field.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood on the field, folding their arms and watching the play, while some curious people took on the role of scouts for the team, running to see the crowd, and then running back to share the situation with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to worry about their manager's life or death, and they took the opportunity to shout curses at their team's poor performance, with words beginning with "F" or "s" popping out of their mouths, and countless high-up middle fingers setting off the "0:2" on the big screen.
Forest's team doctor, Gary F1eming, is still doing his best. He saw Tony's eyes move, but why didn't he respond?
He patted Tony Donne on the face, but there was no response. The team's acting head coach lay on the ground like a wax figure, with his mouth slightly open and his eyes wide open, as if he had seen something surprising.
The blue sky, the white clouds like marshmallows, the faces with different skin tones and different expressions, the noisy environment, all these are familiar, but so strange, as if a thousand miles away from me.
The referee signaled to the team doctor to see to it that he could not stop the game endlessly because of off-field injuries. He blew the whistle for the players to return to the field and the game would continue, even though the Forest players were no longer interested in playing.
"But he may even be in danger! "Fleming was angry at the referee's indifference, pointing to Donn, who was still on the ground, and shouted at the referee.
"Then you can call an ambulance, I'm just the referee! "The referee responded with no sign of weakness, "Besides, he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you said." He pointed behind Fleming and ran back to the court.
Fleming turned back and saw Dawn slowly standing up, touching the back of his head, and he rushed up to help him. "How do you feel, Tony? "
Dawn asked at a loss, "Where is this?"
Fleming turned and swore a dirty word, which had been very unlucky recently. "Des, Des, you come over! "He waved a golden man on the bench.
The man called "Des" came running over. "How is Tony? "
"It's terrible. He even asked me where it is? "
Des's reaction was the same as Fleming's, and he turned his head and cursed.
"I suspect it was the result of the impact on the back of his head when he fell to the ground. "
"Is it bad, Gary? "Dess bit his lip and looked serious.
"I don't know, maybe it's good, maybe it's bad. "Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"The good thing is that he just lost his memory for a while, and he'll get over it after a rest. The bad thing... do you need me to tell you? "
Des waved his hand, indicating that he understood. "Send him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we're behind, and we need him to direct the game... "He said, turning his head to look at Tony Dawn next to him, but he was surprised that Dawn was moving slowly towards the players' aisle alone.
"Hey! "Dess hurriedly left Fleming and ran to catch his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going? "Des's shouting in the noisy environment was actually a "whisper. "
Dawn looked back at Des in a dazed way, a look that chilled Des's heart, and now the afterglow of the setting sun was golden above them, but he couldn't see any light flowing in those eyes.
"Tony, where are you going? "Des repeated.
"I... I don't know, maybe... it's home... "Muttered Dawn, trying to break free from Des's hand.
Fleming also ran over and said, "Tony, you can't go home now. We're playing, you're the head coach, you're in charge of the team! "
The pull of the three men at the entrance of the tunnel attracted the attention of the two benches, as well as the stands, and even the players on the field would glance at it from time to time.
Dawn suddenly laughs: "I'm a coach?" This is ridiculous, how can I be a coach... Although I'm a fan and I often play football manager games, but how can I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a damn nightmare!
"He's desa1ker, a former England international who played as a centre-back, who retired from the team last season, and now he's your colleague, your assistant," Fleming said as he introduced the two men to each other for the first time.
Dawn nods, and then says to Des, "Okay, now you're directing the game for me, and I'm going to rest." Then he breaks Des's hand and walks down the aisle, ignoring the huge boos and the two stunned people behind him.
Fleming looked at Dawn's back, and then at Des Walker.
Walker sighed and turned back. "This game can't be played! "
Dawn sat in the passageway, with his back against the wall, staring at his surroundings in a daze. On the white wall opposite him was a huge sign, with three wavy curves under the big red "mushroom" and an English word below it: Forest.
Where am I? What is going on?
Dawn felt the back of his head, where it still ached.
***, sneak up on Lao Tzu, hit Lao Tzu behind!
"What's my name? "he muttered, but suddenly covered his mouth. Only then did he realize that he had been speaking bird language - English.
"***, how did this happen?"
When Dawn finally realized where he was, he stayed again, which was so strange that his brain stopped responding after the load of calculations, and it all seemed to have nothing to do with him.
This is the scene at the City Stadium this afternoon, where Forest's acting head coach, Tony Downe, was knocked down by his teammates on the sidelines and appeared to be in a temporary coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the players' aisle.
With the dim light of the streetlight outside, Dawn stood in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror, a middle-aged bastard with a tall nose, deep eyes, blue eyes, and a brown curvaceous head.
In fact, Dawn from Sichuan, China, is only twenty-six years old, and the person in the mirror even has a headline! Thirty-four years old! That's Tony Dawn's age.
He not only bent over an Englishman for no reason, but also walked forward for four years and three months!
Although he never thought he was handsome, he could attract many women.
He growled at the mirror, and then smashed it with his fist. The mirror of himself suddenly became innumerable, the fragments fell to the ground with a clattering sound, countless faces looked at Dawn as if laughing at him.
Dawn felt dizzy and took a step back, leaning against the smooth wall and gasping.
After a few minutes in the dark, Dawn gradually calmed down and decided not to think about such complex problems. He had a habit in China of going to a place to drink when something went wrong. There were bars all over Chengdu, and he might be able to find a one-night stand or something. He used to think of Nottingham as Chengdu and decided to go out and find a bar to drink in.
After glancing at the hazy sky outside, he put on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
"After losing 3-3 at home to underdogs Walsall, Forest have had a bad year recently. Paul Hart, who had high hopes, did not bring good results to the team, and he submitted his resignation to chairman Nige1doughty after the last round, which was quickly approved. "
Today's sports news is being broadcast on an elevated television set, with the focus naturally on what is happening on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest match.
There was a hiss in the noisy bar.
A drunk man gave the TV his middle finger. "Tony Dawn, I know him! The little boy who used to be Paul Hart's assistant on the youth team. "
The drunk man had just finished his long speech when Dawn pushed the door in. The noise of the door attracted the attention of most of the people drinking and chatting in the bar, all of whom looked at the door, first surprised when they saw who was coming in, and then a playful smile on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with a glass of wine and shouted, "Our Coach Tony Downe is here! "
"Wow! "The people in the bar hissed "welcome."
"Cheers to his beautiful defense of Johansson's breakthrough outside the court! "The middle-aged man raised his wine glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately followed and raised their wine glass in his hand. "Cheers!
Another man, who was obviously drunk, stood up crookedly, walked up to Dawn, reached to his mouth with a beer bottle in his hand, and belched, "Coach Tony Dawn, it was a beautiful defense, but the referee and the public obviously didn't... didn't think so... huh!
After asking him, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So he pushed the bottle of wine in front of him with a gloomy face. Then he went straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside, "Please bring a bottle..." He used to want to say a bottle of "Xiao Er" - a small bottle of er pot head, although he was from Sichuan, but he went to university in the north, and he liked this spirit from that time on - but he couldn't speak "Xiao Er" in English, and more importantly, he quickly realized that it was in England, not in China.
The others who had been observing him shouted when they heard him say he wanted the strongest wine.
"Yo! Cowardly Tony drinks too?"
The young bartender was also at a loss in the face of the excited guests, he wanted to get the wine but was stopped by the drunkard: "Give him juice! Juice! "
"No, no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ah, ha, ha!"
The owner of the bar, alarmed by the noise outside, came downstairs, stood on the staircase, and saw almost all the guests who had not fallen asleep on the table crowding around the bar, sitting among them a man wrapped in a black windbreaker, ridiculed by the drunkards.
His loud voice made the pub quiet. The drunkards, who had been very arrogant, quieted down when they saw the people standing behind them.
Dawn wondered who could keep the crowd honest with a single word? He turned his head a little and saw a man coming out of the shadows at the staircase.
The young bartender pointed to Dawn and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a spirit. "
When the visitor saw who was sitting there, he was a little surprised, but he said, "Just bring it to him. "
"But... but they didn't let... "The bartender looked awkwardly at the drunkards who had returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, and everyone he saw lowered their heads, either pretending to sleep or drinking with their heads down.Down became more and more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I don't see anyone objecting. Pour him a glass of Scotch and I'll treat him. "The barkeeper turned to Dawn and asked, "Single or double?"
The drunkards laughed as they watched the fun.
The bar owner also laughed. "I forgot who you are... "He poured half a glass of golden whisky into the glass, then added half a glass of water, and then handed it to Dawn: "This is my hometown wine."
Dawn took a sip and immediately began to cough. He rarely drank foreign wine, and the pure Scotch whisky had a strong smell of coke.
There was a burst of gloating laughter in the bar.
"The Tony I know Dawn never drinks, he's like a real old-fashioned Puritan. And he doesn't look at me the way he does, don't you know who I am?" The man stares at Dawn, who seems to see through everything by the man.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Uh... me," Dawn bowed his head and took another sip, this time he did not dare to let the liquor stay in his throat for a second more, but swallowed it directly, and the uncomfortable feeling was lighter.
There was another burst of laughter.
The man touches the back of the head to show understanding.
Someone helped Dawn out, and a voice shouted, "It looks like our coach Tony has really broken his head! The man sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Cup winner, and the winner of the 1978 Stanley Matthews Award, Mr. Kenny Burns! He's a hundred times better than you! "
The people behind him roared with laughter, and the "stupid ass" shouted non-stop, but the object of his ridicule suddenly threw out the half-glass of wine in his hand. The golden Scotch whisky shone brilliantly in the light, made a beautiful arc in the air, and then hit the hapless man's face - as accurately as David Beckham's right foot free kick. "Bang! "
His dirty words were smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Dawn threw himself on the other side with the wine glass with an unexpected quickness. He could not bear it any longer, came to this place for no reason, walked forward for four and a half years, was ridiculed and insulted for no reason... He wanted to vent on someone now, whether he was knocking down someone else or someone else was knocking him down.
The two crashed into the table behind them, and the empty wine bottle fell down and shattered in a crisp noise.
The laughter suddenly stopped, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect that Tony Dawn, who had been a coward, would suddenly explode.
The first person to react was bar owner Kenny Burns, who pushed the fat man standing at the bar and shouted, "What are you doing standing there? Pull them away! "
In addition to the misery on the ground, the battered man's brow was oozing with blood, and there was a red circle, the mark of the mouth of the glass. In addition, his left cheek was punched as red as if he were drunk.
Dawn, on the other hand, did nothing but mess up his head and clothes. He seemed to have vented his anger when he was pulled up, and he didn't have to fight. He arranged his clothes and head, and then spat at the hapless man who was being held up by his companion, "I don't care who you are, don't mess with me. "
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry for the mess I made of you. Today was too ***... "He was annoyed at the thought of being crossed, "I'll apologize in person some other day, and don't worry about compensation."
Then, without waiting for the bar owner to say anything, he turned and walked to the door. As he passed the fat man, he sarcastically said, "You'd better keep your milk for yourself, fat pig. "
Everyone watched him push the door out, but no one thought to stop him, so they watched him leave, leaving a mess.
The bar was quiet, and the drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room and the chaos, and asked, "Did I miss anything? "
I don't want to be a bastard! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Dawn shout like that?
Since his "past life" is quite bad, why not take this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, but he has watched football for more than ten years, the football manager game has been played by every generation, to understand the nature of the work of some coaches, this is not a good opportunity to challenge?
He no longer thinks about why God chose him. He just needs to think about how to be more like a real professional coach, which is hard, but worth trying.
"Hey, man. You broke into my house without my permission, and I'll call the police if you don't leave! "Suddenly an old voice rang.
Dawn looked dazedly at the old man standing opposite, with a lot of newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten hamburger in his hand.
"Is this... your home? "He pointed to the bench below him.
"Of course."
"Ah, I'm sorry to interrupt... "Dawn stood up from his chair, and immediately sat down and lay down. He covered himself with the newspaper in his arms and pressed it firmly between the back of the chair and his body.
Looking at the beggar contentedly eating a hamburger and lying in the "newspaper den," Dawn even thanked God for not allowing himself to "possess" him.
A taxi disembarked in front of him, and he walked quickly forward and got in. Dawn took a last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying his "dinner" and asked the driver to take him back to his strange home.
From today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Dawn's eyes. On Saturday morning, Zhao Yao was on his way to sterilize his cat... on the way to sterilize his cat.
The cat bag in the hand is a yellow fox cat, also called an orange cat, a kind of idyllic cat. The head, back, and limbs are covered with layers of yellow-orange markings.
The chest and stomach are a large piece of fluffy white hair, the tips of the limbs are white, this kind of treading white gloves is said to have a spike effect on girls, will control their brain waves, make them emit "Ah~~Ah~~."
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and looks very feminine.
At this time, the cat was giving out a heart-breaking howl. Most domestic cats are very homely and only want to stay at home for the rest of their lives, moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao only spoke out to comfort the cat.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly streaked across outer space and gradually flew over China, with a strange luster on the surface of the meteor, which seemed to be constantly emitting some kind of rays into the surrounding emptiness.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag on the front desk: "The male cat is sterilized, I made an appointment before, surnamed Zhao. "
"You have not come to us before reading the record, the medical record card information field needs you to fill in. "
In outer space, the meteor slowly crossed the sky over China and began to move in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Where the meteor passed, many cats suddenly had a shock, and their eyes flashed a deep luster, just like the luster emitted by the meteor.
At this moment, Mashcha suddenly moved, struggled and jumped up, and ran towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse let out a cry of surprise, but Zhao Yao on the other side rushed out and grasped the fleeing tea.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow, and he couldn't grasp the body of Mashcha, but only the tail of Mashcha.
When the tail was caught, Mashcha gave a roar, instinctively turned back to bite at Zhao Yao, this is the cat's instinct, the speed is also very fast, instantly opened a gap in the back of Zhao Yao's hand, Zhao Yao's hand back pain, also immediately released the palm.
Maybe she knew she was in trouble, but Mashcha didn't continue to run away, just curled up and looked at Zhao Yao uneasily.
Zhao Yao held the tea and said, "Foolish cat, what do you bite, rebel against it! "
The eyes of the tea-mash cat suddenly flashed a glimmer, and the blood stains on the teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt his head suddenly dizzy, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but this was a little stunned, only to see that the back of his hand was clean, there were no wounds and blood.
The little nurse on the other side took the cat and said, "Obey, make tea, it's all right, it'll be all right in a minute, don't be nervous. "
The call in Zhao Yao's ear was not a simple cat call, but became an intelligible word.
Zhao Yao pointed to the tea in front of him in shock, and said with a surprised face, "This... this... this cat has spoken! "
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao in doubt and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you okay?"
"Didn't you hear me? "Zhao Yao hastened to say, "It... it's talking."
The little nurse's brows frowned, and Zhao Yao's eyes became more and more strange.
"Do you understand me?"
"Take me home!"
"Wow-wow-wow-wow, scared to pee ~ meow. "
Zhao Yao suddenly opened his mouth wide, looked at the side without feeling, still comforting the little nurse, looked at the tea and said, "Can you understand me? "
"I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, take me home, wow-wow-wow-wow. "
The little nurse on the other side turned his head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, but his face became more and more strange.
Despite the nurse's strange eyes, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the tea and put it back in his bag, and trotted away from the hospital.
In the rental house, the cat immediately relaxed when he returned to his familiar environment, lay on the coffee table and began to lick his white hands, squinting his eyes and looking relaxed. For cats, licking their hair is always a very relaxing behavior.
Before the tea table, Zhao Yao stared at the tea-mash cat in front of him and said, "Can you still talk? "
Then he stood up and said, "Does the master want to play the game? "
"Eh, this... wait and play. "Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said at a loss, "When did you learn to talk?"
Looking at the innocent face of the tea-making cat, Zhao Yao's face was strange.
Mashcha Cat didn't feel strange about the situation at all, suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted his eyes and rubbed Zhao Yao's body, and said, "Play games with me."
Looking at the tea-making cat who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao touched his head, and the latter grunted with enjoyment.
"According to it, you are only one year old, and now you are only five years old as a human being. "Zhao Yao's mouth was a little smile: "It's still a child, it seems good."
A month later, at nine o'clock at night.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lives in is only 30 square meters, but the decoration is complete, it is a newly married couple's house, and it is very close to the company, so he works overtime every day without worrying about the traffic problem, so although the rent is not cheap, it still let Zhao Yao willingly.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the tea cat unknowingly climbed up next to him and rubbed his arm with his head, looking intimate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed his head, and the latter showed a look of enjoyment.
But just then, the mobile phone on the sofa was also pushed by the tea.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er lay on the table, her slender white arms resting on her little head, and her long black hair, like satin, flowing down in the air, revealing her half-bright little girlish face, oh, hot, so hot.
What is going on?
There was a steady stream of heat in her body that burned her little face and made her feel uncomfortable. Today, she came to Didu from Yecheng and drank a cup of plain water delivered by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
"No, Tang Moer jumped down, go after her, don't let her run away! "
Tang Mor is an exciting spirit, sober up more than half, Han Xiaowan even designed her!
What should I do?
Tang Mor looked at the man as if he had caught a straw, "Sir, help me, I've been drugged, and there are a few men behind me who want to blow me up. "
The man's deep, cold, narrow eyes looked over the girl at the men behind her, although the eyes were dim, but it was chilling.
Those men were little bastards, and they had seen some of the world, the man who covered the headlines of the whole financial magazine, who controlled the lifeblood of the whole imperial economy, they had seen on TV.
Gu Mohan.
The man was too much for them to offend, so they turned and ran. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle was taking place, with angels with flaming wings, knights in heavy armor, crusaders with golden swords, and an evil army of smoke-covered dragons, monstrous and terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
The battlefield between the two sides is not in a plain full of fire and smoke or a bone field full of bones, but in a dark and invisible darkness, which is undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what is even more bizarre is that outside the battlefield, in the emptiness shrouded by endless darkness, a few faint voices can be heard whispering?
"Operate it, hurry up! My God!"
"When you talk about others, you can control your death knight first! The death knight and the mobile bunker are fighting! "
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy? "
After the battle, the angels, knights, and scattered skeleton soldiers on the battlefield vanished into the background darkness, returning to a state of absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had happened.
But several voices continued to communicate, and even more joined in.
"My teammates are a bunch of pigs! The dogs are better than them! Not only do they not help the battle situation, but also rob the command of the core troops... "The voice of the previous failure said a little reluctantly.
"Bah! It's clearly because the undead creatures are too weak, if it was changed to my demon army, it would be different... "The other voice also showed no sign of weakness in the counterattack, and made such a forced explanation for his wrong command: "I thought the death knight could easily solve those blockhouses."
After hearing this sound, there were a few chuckles in the dark, and the two sides of the argument lost their temper and said to the victorious side, "I'm not as good as a man, I'm willing to bow down. "
And the winner made a round of unseemly ridicule?
"Ha, ha! Justice will defeat evil!"
"In the face of our strength, whether it is the dead or the demons, even the gods will kill you!"
This is undoubtedly more infuriating, the two sides had calmed down and immediately launched a new round of scolding battle, while the third person of the victorious side outside the new battlefield, a little helpless asked: "Should I not organize this round of games? "
It turned out that the fierce and heroic battle before was just a game?
A voice who did not participate in the game responded, "It's great to be able to use consciousness to simulate a realistic war, so that we onlookers seem to be immersed in it, you are really good at surprise us, I hope you. "
When the guy called Hope was suddenly thankful, he answered in a low-key way, "You praised me, it's just a pastime. "
Yes, the battle, which was like a life-and-death battle between the good and the evil, was just a pastime, adding only a little fun to the endless prison.
This is the empty realm beyond the plane of reality, which is supposed to be the Jedi forever dark, cold, silent, where no life will survive, and a realm more fearful than death.
However, in such a place, the place of death that can not hold any life, but stubbornly survives a group of difficult to characterize creatures, they have lost their body, only the last consciousness remains in this emptiness.
They call themselves the Void Walkers, and are forever imprisoned in the prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the supreme strongmen of all races and fields, the mages who climbed to the apex of the magic path, the soldiers who touched the limits of martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the faithful and noble missionaries, the demons who ruled the hell, the lich who controlled the soul, and so on, and they have left their names in the history of all planes.
Many people think they have long since vanished, only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they do not know that these old monsters are strong enough to be described as perverted, in fact, imprisoned in the endless emptiness outside the plane, where they have spent incalculable years, and it seems that they will be imprisoned here forever, the seemingly thin barrier between the reality plane and the emptiness, is a wall of sighs that they can never break through, Rao is the power they once had is so powerful, but there is nothing to do about it.
But they never gave up hope of escape, because among the 33 Void Walkers there is a very special existence, which is the fifth walker code-named Hope.
I hope the original name Bai Yi is not from those planes of human existence outside the emptiness, but from a strange place called the Earth, he was an editor of a small news website, his daily work is to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then replace it with a shock!
Men will shed tears, women will be silent and so on the headlines published on their home website, a noisy and tedious job.
Later, due to an accident, Bai Yi lived and died, but his consciousness did not immediately disappear, but instead entered the mysterious emptiness under the error of yin and yang, met several other emptiness walkers, and finally lived so strongly until this moment.
The Void Walkers insist that he from a different world will be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "Only you are different, want to leave here, you are our only opportunity, I firmly believe this, so I call you by the code name of hope," the Void First Walker, the codenamed Sorcerer, once said to him.
They have always believed in this, that they would one day see the light of day, even though they have been in captivity for countless hours, hundreds of years? thousands of years?
If you want to hold on for thousands of years in this immutable prison without going crazy, it's obviously not enough to just talk or discuss; in fact, the main means of pastime for vacuous walkers is an activity called memory sharing.
The activity is based on a consciousness technique called memory retrospection, which allows people to recall every detail of their experience, even every punctuation on the newspaper.
Then, through a certain degree of editing, remove some memories that you don't want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your left and right hand, and then exchange your memories with each other, which is equivalent to enjoying a very long movie about someone else's life, which is a great way to pass the time.
The memory of the thirty-three empty walkers is equivalent to his thirty-three lives, even though he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid memory confusion, only retained their knowledge and experience, but his state of mind also in the thirty-three life experience, sifted away the weaknesses of naivety, impetuous, become mature and calm, no longer the ordinary people on Earth.
That's why he was highly expected by other vacuous walkers, but after countless years, even he couldn't find any opportunity to disengage, the only thing he could do was to make this dull time a little less boring.
At the same time, the reality of Easter is about to usher in the night, when the afterglow of the sunset covered the whole Xian Sai College, the students finally ended the day's heavy school work, accompanied by young and full of cheerful laughter, walking in twos and threes on the college's boulevard paths.
Mia, a sophomore in the Soul A Department, was also one of them. She had a cute face, her long black hair was combed into two equally cute double ponytails, and she was wearing the standard uniform of Xian Sai College. After a simple farewell with her classmates, she went to the college square alone, found a bench at random, sat down, and then rubbed out some half a piece of bread from her blouse pocket, tore the bread into a little bit of crumbs, and then sprinkled it on the green stone floor of the square.
After a moment, a sound of wings puffing and flapping was heard in mid-air, and several white doves fell quickly to Miya's feet, pecking down at the crumbs she had spilled, and uttering a cooing sound, Miya squatted carefully, and the long two horsetails gently swept on the ground with her movements, silently looking at the group of doves she had already known, with a happy smile on her face.
Beautiful girls, docile white doves, the square with several statues standing quietly, with the lush surrounding vegetation, in the last golden light of the sunset, together converge into a beautiful picture.
This is what Miya does every day, and it is the most relaxing time of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life at Xian Sai College is always very hard.
"It's getting dark, I'll be here today, I have to go back to practice, goodbye, Mr. Pigeons. "Miya kept a relaxed smile on her face, said goodbye to the group of pigeons, and then walked back to her dormitory with her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under the hem of her short uniform skirt.
Evening is also an important time to study, especially for a talented student like Miya, the effort required is not as easy as the smile that seems to hang on her face forever.
1. Chapter 1
The Su family mansion, a huge martial arts theater, is holding the awakening ceremony of the soul of the martial arts.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, was the son of the elder of the Su family and had great talents.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed the nine-fold quenching at the age of fourteen, which is said to be the first day of the Su family.
Now there is such a genius as Su Yu, so with Su Mo's talent, the awakened spirit of martial arts will certainly not be worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo can also awaken the spirit of martial arts above the fifth level, then this time, the Su family can appear two top talents, their future development of the Su family is not trivial.
When the presiding elder called out the name, the shocked students, elders and others all looked at the beautiful young man next to them, and the anticipation in their eyes was incredibly strong, even surpassing that of Su Yu before.
Sumo's face was calm and he lifted his steps to the altar.
As he walked down the altar, Su Yu, with a proud face, gave Su Mo Leng a cold smile, and his eyes were full of provocation.
Sumo didn't pay attention to him, took a deep breath, and sat on his knees with his eyes closed.
From the bottom of the altar, a stream of light immediately wafted out and penetrated into Sumo's body.
His talent was a top-notch presence in the Su family, and he completed the quenching at the age of only 15, which is not a bad talent. However, he was always overwhelmed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more runes glittered on the altar, wrapping Sumo's body.
Su Mo, sitting with his eyes closed, breathed slightly rapidly, and from his body, a roar gradually sounded.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar!
Boom!
Finally, with an explosion, a dark shadow suddenly rises up, like a black hole, which slowly spins inside, without seeing the bottom, giving a sense of coldness.
At the same time, a yellow halo flashed above the shadow.
Ah!
In a flash, everyone's eyes glazed.
A halo?
The lowest martial spirit?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu's face was dull and stunned.
Because, he never thought, on the first day of the Su family, he only awakened the first-level martial spirit, the lowest martial spirit!
Su Mo sat on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, and when he saw his soul, he was stunned.
"The first-level martial spirit...! "Sumo murmured to himself, arousing a wry smile at the corner of his mouth, he never thought that he had awakened a lowest-level martial spirit!
The most rubbish martial spirit? ""Awakened a waste martial spirit!
"What's the first day? It's the first waste of my Su family. "
For a while, everyone, including Su's parents, deacons, and others, looked at Su Mo in a different way, disappointed, disdainful, and disdainful.
On the altar, Sumo slowly stood up and his fists were clenched unconsciously.
After a cold glance, Sumo sneered in his heart, "These people are really snobbish! "
In the past, Sumo was so talented that everyone was very kind to him, and everywhere he went, he was always back and forth, flattering and clapping.
Now, he awakened the garbage spirit, and these people immediately changed their faces.
Sumo shook his head, didn't bother with them, and strode off the altar.
His face was a little itchy, and there seemed to be a piece of grass around him.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I come back to life?"
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped death, the sight made him stare with excitement.
I can't! How can such a beautiful girl go anywhere?
Xu Xiao stared wide-eyed. So he watched the beautiful girl completely take off her skirt in front of his eyes, and the blasphemous trousers inside were taken off little by little, and the eyes were white and tender, with a unique body fragrance of a woman.
"Lady, what are you doing? You can't defecate anywhere!"
The scene was deadlocked. She let out a scream, put down her skirt in a panic, and the whole person bounced up from the same place, and flew away with a sharp sword.
Damn it, what is this? The Royal Sword Flying?
So, is it really a goddamn fairy?
Xu Xiao was startled, and at the same time, a large number of strange but familiar memories sprang up in his head, as if he had been born with them.
I've fuckin' crossed it!
Immediately read the files in my mind, the memory that does not belong to me, Xu Xiao cleared everything.
This is actually a world of cultivating immortals, just like the little fairy who is so angry that she is flying with her sword, people can practice various practices to become immortals.
The owner of this picture of his body is today's princess, but this princess is absolutely unlucky.
He himself is only a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was recruited as a prince by the emperor under the opportunity to provide him with countless talents and treasures for cultivation, and in just six years, he congealed his belly and entered the Jindan period.
When he entered the Jindan period, he really entered the bridal chamber with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights in the wedding bed, and as a result, the beautiful and glamorous princess, like a fox, repaired his whole body to make up for it, and even took away his spiritual talents.
The talented princess was just newly married and was reduced to a waste man. He was sent out of the palace in a low-key night, and on the way to the frontier, he was slapped to death by the man arranged by the emperor, died of anger, and was finally dumped here.
"Alas, it's a pity!"
After clearing up these memories, Xu Xiao looked regretful, shook his head and sighed, and said in chagrin, "Damn it! Why didn't you take a step earlier to get through the happy time of crazy exercise in bed with the beautiful princess? "
Thinking of the beautiful princess's ecstatic charm on the wedding bed, her proud figure, and her amorous breath, Xu Xiao felt even more pitiful, a step too late!
"Bold thieves, dare to spy on this girl in the toilet, give me life! "
At this moment, a sweet rebuke suddenly came, and it was the fairy who had gone and returned.
Her face was red with shame and indignation, but her eyes were full of endless killing intentions, and she stepped on the cold and sharp sword and killed Xu Xian.
"Damn me, fairy, this is absolutely a misunderstanding! Clearly you squatted on the place where I lay, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please put your pants on first, OK? You look like me, I have no motivation to escape!" Xu Xiao shouted, and ran.
The woman's face suddenly changed, red-faced, lifted the blasphemous trousers under the skirt, blew, and angrily rebuked: "The harlot is looking for death." The speed of the sword flying under her feet suddenly increased, swishing towards Xu Xiao to kill.
While running wildly, Xu Xiao frantically thought of a way to escape.
All of a sudden, there was a flash of light in my mind.
Immediately, he stopped his footsteps, reached out his hand and took a familiar token from his arms, turned around and shouted to the woman: "Bold witch, I am the princess of the Republic of Fire, you dare to disrespect me? Be careful I'll kill you nine tribes! "
At this moment, Xu Xiao's head suddenly sounded a series of system beeps.
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' for activating the face-to-face system, this system will protect you and help you to fly! "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' pretending to be successful, the reward of the pretending to be worth 1 point, will you enter the shopping mall to exchange? "
"The system detected that the host'Xu Xiao' ability is weak, difficult to survive in the world, a special reward for the novice package, do you check the package? "
When the beep sounds, a light screen window pops up in front of you, showing several pieces of information and data.
Xu Xiao first took a breath, followed by an irresistible burst of laughter. What this pretend face-beating system, I heard it was tailor-made for me, to help me break the skyline of the anti-sky system ah!
"The harlot, you're dying, what's funny about you?"
All of a sudden, a petty rebuke pulled Xu Xiao back from his ecstasy.
The woman was standing ten meters in front of him, pointing at him with a flying sword in her hand, but her big eyes were staring at him suspiciously.
"Come here... want to do it with me, don't you? Is there a way you can try to get closer to me? "
"Ding, congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' for the success of the pretend force, the reward of the pretend force value of 1 point. "
Sure enough, the system beep in Xu's ear, which only he could hear, sounded again, and he couldn't help laughing again. "By the way, there seems to be a gift package. "
Immediately, the picture of the light curtain window changed, a square gift box appeared, the gift box was opened, a few streams of light leaped out, and flashed away.
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' for getting the initial experience Dan, taking it can get 10,000 experience points. "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' on getting two of the first-level God's Escape Charms, which can be moved to any place within a five-kilometer area immediately after use. "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' on getting the first level of the Taikoo Five Elements Recipes (Note: the first level can only be cultivated to the foundation period, can be exchanged in the shopping mall). "
"Ding, detected the host'Xu Xiao' spiritual root defect, does not meet the conditions of cultivation, the system will complete all the spiritual roots for you. "
Immediately, Xu Xiao felt as if an electric current was running through his body, and his scalp became numb.
But it is followed by a sense of comfort, the pores all over the body seem to be completely opened, greedily absorbing the four sides of the aura.
Boom!
Soon, he felt that his body had changed dramatically, becoming closer to nature, as if he could blend in with everything and control everything.
But he knows how familiar this feeling is, when the fire root was not taken away by the princess, he had such a kind feeling for the fire, and now the system not only repairs his fire root, but also completes the other properties of the root.
Gold, wood, water and fire, all five kinds of spiritual roots are all at once, and each is the most superior "day" level.
I went, it's against the sky!
Thinking of this, Xu Xiao finally couldn't help shouting: "The system is in hand, I have the world, what bullshit, the princess of the Republic of China, when I upgrade Xu Xiao to return, I will step on you all underfoot, step on the crushing. "
"The daring harlot, since he claimed to be the prince of the Fire Yuan Kingdom, dared to speak out in an attempt to kill the king? "The woman next to him was a bit silly, the princess lost his heart?
"Ding, congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' for the success of the pretending force, get the value of the pretending force 1 point. "
Xu Xiao then calmed down, the corners of his mouth slightly twitched, damn, Gu dresses to look forward to the future, almost forget the trouble at present, we have to find a way to run.
"By the way, experience Dan!"
He suddenly remembered that there was a beginner's experience Dan in the beginner's package.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly used the idea of the operating system interface, opened a package, three items suddenly appeared in it.
"Use, use. "Xu Xiao stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' on the success of the cultivation of the Five Elements of Taikoo. "
"Ding, the host'Xu Xiao' took the initial experience Dan, and gained 10,000 experience points. "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' upgrade, the current state of the gas refining period one level. "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' upgrade, the current state of the three-level gas refining period. "
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Xiao' upgrade, the current state of the gas refining period of ten levels. "
In a few short breaths, Xu Xiao changed from a mortal without the power to bind a chicken to a cultivator, and sprinted directly to the ten levels of the gas refining period, just one step away from the foundation-building period.
And his current strength is innumerable more powerful than the normal ten-level gas refining period.
The reason is that he has five spiritual roots, which is equivalent to a person has five times the strength of ordinary people.
Even with the mutually reinforcing nature of these five different auras, the power of the outburst is much more than five times as simple.
"This time I really have nothing to say, I'm not invincible who is invincible?"
Xu Xian couldn't stop being excited. But at this moment, the woman on the opposite side waved a stream of light across the sky, and the sharp blade of the sword darted like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn me, fairy, I just asked you this little beauty to come and have a good look at the princess, who let you out of the sword? You're a sneak attack! "
When Xu Xiao saw the flying sword attacking him, he was startled and immediately opened his mouth to scold.
You can scold and scold, but the movement of the feet is not ambiguous at all, slipping back, the fingertips condensed a wisp of water aura, lightly flicking on the blade of the oncoming sword.
"Dang! "
There was a trembling sound, and the sword flew out of him.
"How is it possible?"
The woman was stunned. Those who could crack the sword so easily in the gate, except for those masters who cultivated to be unfathomable, at least those brothers and sisters who built the foundation on the sixth floor could do it!
"I was wondering, I said what happened just now was a misunderstanding, you are always entangled, and you want to kill me? Don't think you look like a fairy, I won't hit you, anyhow, I didn't see clearly, this time I'll look at it openly and aboveboard. "
Xu Xian angrily scolded, and Yu stepped out at his feet, the Tuyuan aura suddenly melted into the earth, the speed suddenly doubled, and in the blink of an eye appeared in front of the woman.
Following, a wisp of water aura gushed out of the palm of her hand, surrounding the four sides, the woman had not had time to react, and was imprisoned on the spot.
"The bastard... the bastard, what do you want to do? "The woman was startled, feeling that the fire aura in the body was completely suppressed.
"Hey hey! Since you've called me a harlot? Then I can't take this pot for nothing. "
Xu Xiao had a cheap smile on his face, raised his eyebrows, and reached directly into the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is an afterlife, accompany the world dance!
Nine-fold sky, sea of clouds, thunderstorm platform, a line of sky!
Here, is the nine-fold sky mainland, three days, a Jedi, a thunderstorm platform! On the thunderstorm, in and out of the sky!
But at the moment, on the platform of the thunderstorm, there is a gloomy wind and mist!
"Chuyang, hand over the Nine Swords! Forgive you not to die!"
"Chuyang, the Jiujiu Jian, the first divine thing in the world in your hands, is a pure waste, how many years, you have made no progress, is simply a tyrannical thing!
There were loud shouts from all directions.
The look in my eyes is still as calm and fixed as a rock! - The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, it is full of willingness to bend! Even though he has been fatally wounded!
At his feet, within hundreds of feet around him, countless stumps were broken and bloody.
Looking around at all the masters who were just shouting, but didn't rush over, Chu Yang showed a sneering smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such a person, with such a xinxing, no matter how high he cultivates, no matter how many he has; even if he can kill me 10,000 times, he is not worthy of being my enemy!
How could the Jiuquan Jian in his own hands be leaked out? I had been investigating for three years before and after the last three days to determine that there was a cut-off body of the Ninth Jiuquan Jian in the thunderstorm platform, and after a lot of painstaking efforts, I finally found the opportunity to risk the death of the nine to come to the last three days, but why did I encounter such a huge ambush after I came here?
Today, I've been in the last three days, and it's only the fifth day! Today's situation, pure death! I've always been known for my secret whereabouts, who knows my plan?
I rushed a dozen times in a row, and each time, I was blocked back! And the places I chose are all dead corners!
Extremely in love, extreme in sword! I put my love into the sword, enter the martial arts with kendo, seek the heavenly way with martial arts, at the cost of lifelong loneliness, and kill everywhere to save the world's treasure raft, but after all, I still can't practice the Nine Swords, practice the Nine-fold Heavenly God Gong!
Is it the wrong choice? Or is this path wrong at all?
Ruthless swordsman Ruthless swordsman, if the swordsman is ruthless, what is a swordsman? Kendo martial arts, after all, are ruthless... But now, at the time of life and death, why is it so wobbly?
Jiujiu Jian, Jiujiu Jian, what is your secret?
As he stared greedily at the Jiuquan Jian, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You only know that if you get the Jiuquan Jian, you will be invincible in the world, but do you know how much I have paid for the Jiuquan Jian?
There's nothing left.
Blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly felt that his life was passing quickly. He pursued martial arts all his life, fell in love, broke in love, and fell out of love until he was ruthless. At the moment of death, he thought that his only regret was that he had not reached the highest state of his life, but what he did not expect was that at this moment, a figure appeared in his mind that he thought he had long forgotten.
Don't dance lightly, Chuyang into the love of a woman!
"Originally, I didn't really break the heart... "Chu Yang's mouth showed a self-deprecating smile, muttered to himself.
A trace of remorse quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, sweeping his whole heart in a flash.
Dancing lightly! I don't know if I'll go to Huangquan this time, may I get together with you?
"Everyone! Just chop him off! As for the Jiuquan Jian, we'll discuss it slowly and not be too late!" One person shouted, "If not, we'll have to waste our time when he answers some! "The people around us made a roaring promise, and immediately raised their swords and gathered around Chuyang.
"One life is not a light dance, one dance is a life of suffering; this life is a king's dance, dance a life of suffering!"
This is a little poem written by Mo Qiandance on the night of love. I remember, when Mo Qiandance had tears in her eyes, her eyes were sad and sad, she... knew she was practicing with her love, but she still threw herself into her arms like a moth on fire, and let herself burn!
When I heard about it, I rushed to it immediately, but after all, I was a step too late. Although I later killed all the family members who had hurt Mo Lightly, I didn't leave the chickens and dogs of the nine ethnic groups, but the beautiful people can't come back to life!
When she was dying, she lay softly in her arms and said to herself, "Chuyang, if there is a future life... if I can meet you, I hope you can take a good... look at me. I'm better-looking than a sword! "
Dancing lightly, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can there be tears in the corner of your eyes?
Two drops of tears, but my heart, at that moment, smashed to pieces! From then on, this heart is dusty!
Life and death come together to the nine sky!
This is a poem written by the first talent in the world, Xue Tear Han, who felt Mo Qiandiao's deep love for Chuyang.
And now, dance lightly, you have reached the nine sky, but I am still in the world... but, I can immediately follow you to life and death... life and death!
Chu Yang thought in a daze, always cold and hard mouth, hanging out a gentle and sad smile.
Dancing, wait for me!
Dancing lightly, you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice any kendo, I would rather not have any peak, I would rather not take revenge, I would also be with you! In this world, what can be worth your satisfied smile?
No! Not bitter... dance lightly, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter, now... I am bitter!
More and more swords are added, blood flies out, pain focuses from all parts of the body, and finally interrupts the song and dance in my mind!
Chuyang's long howl of rage! Standing up suddenly, his long black hair fluttering violently!
Chu Yang's heart ached, and when he looked down, the piece of jade pei hanging on his neck smashed in front of his eyes.
This is the only memorial left to me by the light dance!
"Kill! "Chu Yang suddenly looked up, the killing machine in his eyes rushed wildly, a shout, the hand of the nine hijacking sword suddenly waved ten thousand swords, just like the nine days of lightning suddenly joined into a girdle of light belt!
There was a banging pong, and all the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
All of them hurriedly retreated, looking in horror at the neat circle and half of weapons under Chu Yang's feet, and the cold sweat flowing down on the vest.
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Nine Swords? "
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he gave a cold smile and slowly said, "Okay! I'll show you the Nine Swords! "
He suddenly jumped up! He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, and he jumped up!
"Nine hijacking swords, a little cold light, ten thousand awns!"
As the arc shoots out, tens of thousands of cold awns rush out!
Nine-fold day swordsmanship! One sword!
Jiu Chongtian is the name of this continent. All the swordsmanship has never dared to use these three words, but the Jiu Chongtian swordsmanship is directly named "Jiu Chongtian"!
From ancient times to the present, only this set!
Although Chu Yang could not exert the real power of the Jiuquan swordsmanship, he had understood these swords for a long time. Although the power of these swords was not as great as he imagined, it was far beyond the worldly swordsmanship.
Dozens of masters around, knowing that this sword is not trivial, all took out the ability to press the bottom of the box, and tried their best to resist the attack! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapons in their hands, they were almost unsteady.
"Nine Swords, what's the harm of killing the whole world!"
The first move is not finished, the second move is already killing! The surging light, like the tide of the sea, the boundless killing machine burst out!
Screams sounded, a dozen masters enough to monopolize, at the same time trying to resist, but still splashing blood all over, awkward retreat!
At this moment, everyone has a delusion: Chu Yang is absolutely not hurt! Absolutely in a complete state!
But they didn't know that they interrupted Chuyang's memory, interrupted Mo's songs and dances, let Chuyang completely rage, thoroughly exert all the potential of the body! This is the power of life, the rage of the soul!
"Nine Swords, a gathering of the wind and clouds is the emperor!"
Chu Yang opened his eyes and shouted, "Why? Why not? "
In the distance, in three directions, three lights rise at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air!
I'm only Wuzun, although the distance from the king is only one level, but this level, it is no different from the difference between the world!
Three kings! What a great handwriting!
"But in the past three days, it's not a place where you can run wild with a poisonous sword! "One person said softly, "It's a pity that I can't fight with you fairly, I'm sorry!"
As they spoke, the other two appeared together. All three, with wide robes and big sleeves, came in the wind with flowing clothes.
Chu Yang's eyes were already a little blurred: "You three kings... also want the Nine Swords? "
"I want you to die! "The three of them smile at the same time, as if the demeanor: "But by taking over the Jiuquan sword, it is also a windfall. Great harvest!"
Chu Yang smiled coldly and arrogantly, straightened his back, and said proudly, "It's a pity you don't know the Nine Swords! You'll never get it!" His eyes became resolute and resolute!
He is powerless to fight now!
It was the only sword he could use with full power, and when he saw the knack, he knew it could be used by himself. But such a sword needed to be motivated by his own life!
It is the spirits of the nine robbing swords that kill and destroy everything!
The three kings were almost too late to fight, and before they could even scream, they went up in smoke! Even the golden shadow of their royal power still flashed in the air, but their lives were already nothing!
Chu Yang sighed, in mid-air, his eyes fluttering casually, only to find a figure who he thought should never be here. In the distance, a man in white stared at this side, his face full of disbelief.
"God's secret? "Chu Yang kept his eyes, and finally understood. Why was his secret action ambushed, why were all his attacks accurately intercepted!
It turned out to be him, the magic plan is not a secret. No wonder I failed so badly!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the sky, slowly fell down, like the dead leaves of the late autumn, fell on the dust, with a light but warm smile on his face, muttering: "Dance lightly, if there is an afterlife, accompany the world dance! "
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest enthusiasm and the most intense longing! Because there is your lover!
Chapter II
Meng Qi's secret happiness was interrupted, and his complacency turned to shame and annoyance, while Zhende and other novice monks looked at him with surprise and disdain, which meant that the primary school students should separate themselves from the bad classmates, only Zhenhui "Fang Aqi" stared at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, looking like a god traveling outside the sky.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half turned his head and looked at the Xuanzang next to him. Did he see any clues?
For him, shame and frustration are small things, but exposing the fact that he has resurrected himself is the big problem!
Xuanzang's face was still bitter and his eyes were dejected. After feeling Meng Qi's eyes, he gently shook his head: "There is no Amitabha in the south, everything is subject to the decision of Xuan's bitter master." He did not hint, but said it directly.
Well, he thought I thought he was begging him for intercession... Mengqi quietly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that he had passed this test, unless the parents who abandoned the body, the horse-faced uncle, and so on, or it should not be seen through, if another ten years and eight years, it will be even more unsuspecting, childhood memories are easy to forget.
Compared to this, it's only a small thing to get into the junkyard!
The crooked Meng Qi tried to make his expression look as dull as Zhenhui, so that he would not be seen by Xuanzang that he was not so depressed and sad.
After the wide-faced and big-eared Xuanqi inquired about the remaining children one by one, together with Mengqi and Zhenhui, a total of six were enrolled in the military service home, and the rest were assigned to the monastery.
The ruler of his right hand tapped on the palm of his left hand: "Come with me to the sundry house to be ordained, take the robes and Buddhist sutras and other things, and in the future, I will work hard, and I will never have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma schools to practice advanced Buddhist sutras and martial arts."
Is there Dharma here, too?
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuanxiang didn't give him time to think, so he walked directly through the children and out of the temple.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi dared not ask much, and followed the two yellow-clad monks, Xuan Chu and Xuan Zang, into a nearby courtyard.
"You're not a formal introduction, you just need to worship the Buddha and leave your name. "Huan Chuan pointed to the futon in the small Buddhist temple.
"Yes, Uncle Xuanqiu, "the children all responded with Zhende, and then one by one knelt on the futon and kowtow to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshiped the Buddha, Xuanxiang put his hands together, Baoxiang solemnly saluted the image of the Buddha, chanting "Nanwu Amitabha," then he walked up to a child and put his right hand on top of his head.
The child's long black hair changed immediately, and with the speed that Mengqi could see, the roots turned yellow and fell to the ground like leaves, and in less than two breaths, the child became a real novice.
"The troubles are gone, the red dust is far away, "said Xuan bitterly and solemnly, his mellow voice reverberating in the pure Buddhist temple.
"What is this martial arts? It's amazing!"
Meng Qi was amazed and excited. Will he have the opportunity to learn such martial arts in the future?
He walked up to the children one by one and removed their hair, saying the same words all the time.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, meditated on the name of Buddha Daozu, and mourned for the hair that was about to say goodbye to him.
The thick and wide palm of his hand caressed the top of Meng Qi's head, and a piece of withered hair fell in front of his eyes, which made him sad and almost uncontrollable, but he loved the red dust to death, and never thought of becoming a monk.
"The troubles are gone, the red dust away."
The melancholy sound was like the sudden ringing of a chime bell, which made Meng Qi tremble all over and clear his heart.
But after the painstaking departure and the clearness vanished, Meng Qi's faith is still firm, and he must return to the vulgar in the future!
After worshiping Buddha, ordaining, and leaving a monk's dish, Xuanqiang asked several gray-clad monks to take the children to the backyard to receive their own things - two sets of gray robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, Shaolin Commandments, Twelve Little Mantras in Morning Class, and so on.
"You can recite the precepts of the temple and the morning mantras after you have practiced the words in the'Lecture of the Confucian School', before that, I will briefly talk about the main precepts of the temple, first, don't deceive the master and destroy the ancestors, second, don't allow, don't steal martial arts, third, don't kill, fourth, don't drink alcohol, fifth, forbid meat and hindrance, sixth, don't break the precepts... "
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and the others were hard work, copying the scriptures, caning, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the "miscellaneous yard" with the young novice monks.
"In this monastery, those in gray robes are ordinary monks, those in yellow robes are deacons of the monasteries, and those in yellow robes and red robes are the abbot, the head of the monasteries, and the elders..." On the way, Xuan bitterly instilled "common sense in the monastery" in the young novices, until Zhende and others entered the "Wu Monastery," he became silent again.
As the group walked more and more astray, both inside and outside the yellow wall were covered by green trees, and there was a rare Buddhist temple. After a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled old courtyard.
"Alas, brother Xuan Chu, brother Xuan Zang, you came so early?" A fat monk greeted him with a smile at the door, wearing the same yellow clothes, but the collar was slanted open, the stomach was weak.
Xuan bitterly frowned, meticulously combined the ten ways: "Nan has no Amitabha Buddha, Xuanxin brother, how can you be so lazy? "
The fat monk Xuanxin had long been familiar with Xuan's bitter temper, and did not get angry at all, saying, "Alas, you are too attached to the foreign minister, this is for our disciple of the mixed service school?" He did not want to entangle with Xuan's bitterness on this issue, directly pointing to Meng Qi and other humanities.
"I also ask brother Xuanxin to arrange it. "Xuan answered with painstaking seriousness.
At this time, Xuan Zang, who had been doing saw-beaked gourd, suddenly opened his mouth: "Zhen Ying, Zhen Guan is still in the miscellaneous service yard? "
"It's still there, it's still there! "The fat monk Xuanxin said in doubt, "Brother Xuanzang, what do you ask them to do? Do you intend to accept them as apprentices?"
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed, "My martial arts have been destroyed, so I can't mislead my children, so why dare I accept an apprentice?
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhenhui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently, Xuanzang this is the first time to arrange his own affairs, do the two monks really Ying and Zhenguan have something special, can help themselves?
"Haha, brother Xuanzang, the things you ordered, how dare I take on a word of'trouble'? Such a small thing, why do you need to be so? "Xuanxin agreed.
Xuanqiang looked sideways at Xuanzang and did not say much, but Zhengse said to Mengqi, Zhenhui and other novices, "I put you in the Miscellaneous Home because you each have problems, and if you can understand yourself and hone your xinxing, you may not have the opportunity to enter the Wushu Monastery, the Dharma Monastery, and even the Bodhi Monastery in the future."
"But if you continue to steal and play, lazy and playful, impetuous, unbearable suffering, I will not hide it, I will inform the Ordination Institute, and give you the corresponding punishment. "
He said what he thought without concealing it, to show that he was frank and unselfish, and made the old man beside him blush.
"Yes, Uncle Xuan Chuan, "answered Meng Qi and other novice monks in unison.
After seeing Xuan Suan and Xuan Zang leave, Xuanxin wriggled his body and let the pieces of fat tremble up and down: "Finally I'm gone, I'm most afraid to see this iron-faced ghost. "
The monk... Meng Qi put on a blind eye, followed the walking vacillation of the mystical heart into the Zen room.
"Zhenying, Zhenguan, this is your master Zhending, Zhenhui." Xuanxin pointed to Mengqi and Zhenhui, then turned around and took the other novice monks to another Zen room.
Inside the zen room, there is a bunk, enough for seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
On the bunk, two gray-clad monks lay down and sat down, both in their twenties, the one lying down with a dull expression and a dazed speechless, the one sitting with a deep frown and a cold tone: "Just put the luggage on the bottom of the bunk, if you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the yard to get it." "I don't know what to call brother? "
Meng Qi took a look at Mu Mu's true wisdom and decided to establish a good "roommate relationship" on his own.
The person sitting there said coldly, "True view. "
After answering, he stopped speaking, and even turned his head away from Meng Qi and Zhenhui, so that Meng Qi could not play the topic of close relations.
As for Zhenying, she closed her eyes and continued to sleep.
Who are these people?
Meng Qi returned to the dark in his belly, but on the surface he said to Zhenhui with a smile, "Zhenhui master, I'm Zhending, you can call brother Shi in the future. "
"Yes, brother, "Zhenhui shouted without any difficulty.
It's better for this stupid little guy!
Meng Qi sighed to himself and decided to play the role of his brother and help Zhenhui: "Little master, eh, I'll call you little master, come on, we'll change the monk's clothes first. "
Although there were people in the house, Meng Qi, who was often naked in his dormitory when he was in college, did not feel uncomfortable, so he quickly took off his clothes and put on his monk's clothes.
He quietly thanked the monk for wearing the simple clothes, so that he would not make a fool of himself, while inspecting the things on his body that he had not had time to examine.
The body of the robe, weaving fine, light and soft, even if Meng Qi does not know the goods, it can be seen that the value is very expensive, at the same time, "he" is hanging a piece of transparent jade pei on the waist, wearing a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red cord on the neck, close to the chest, cool and cool, so uncomfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized jade Buddha, only to see "it" full of compassion, lifelike, obviously extraordinary carving, at the same time, "it" feels delicate, both warm and cool.
"According to Uncle Ma-face, what nameless old monk sent this jade Buddha? But since the prince did not take it away, it is probably not extraordinary, it is better to wear it close to the body. "
Meng Qi hung the jade Buddha pendant over his chest and hid it close to his body, then packed up the jade pei and clothes and put them under the bunk he chose.
At this time, Zhen Ying, who had been sleeping, suddenly turned over and sat up, quickly put on his shoes and went out of the door, making Meng Qi stunned, not understanding what had happened.
"It's time for dinner. "Zhen Guan said coldly, and went down the bunk and out the door.
Who are these two people?
Meng Qi scolded again, and then turned to Zhenhui and said, "Little teacher, is it all right? It's dinner time! "
"Okay! "Zhenhui's voice just fell, the small figure like a rabbit darted to the door, as if already starving.
"... "Meng Qi was embarrassed, is it only himself who is more normal here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door, looked back at Meng Qi, and said with doubt on her face, "Brother, won't you go? "
You have a little conscience, know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought to himself, and then half-jokingly replied, "I'm not as hungry as you. "
Look at you one and two, it's like a starving ghost incarnate!\Q>
He turned and began to run.
Hello! After a few moves, he shouted, "Eh, little teacher, wait for me! "
All of a sudden, a sadness and desolation hit him, the other's is the little sister, why I only have a little brother, and in the foreseeable future there will be no sister.
In the pouring rain, a beautiful woman of twenty-seven and eight years old, with a boy of five and six years old, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
A woman named Zhao Meiling came from a remote mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to university with a dream and hope, but she didn't expect to meet a man who would change everything for her.
At that time, Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in a school, an accident, she was taken in by Li Zhe, and then Li Zhe launched a frantic pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost a lot of tricks, no means.
Zhao Meiling was just a simple and simple girl who had just come to the city, and that would be the rival of such a master of love, not only the body, but also the heart were completely given to him, but then Li Zhe was tired of playing with her, and then he ruthlessly abandoned her.
Later, Zhao Meiling learned that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the baby, so she fell out with her family.
After the birth of the child, Zhao Meiling wanted to raise him alone, but five years later, because her body was too tired and she became incurably ill, she had no years to live, and she finally decided to send the child to the Li family, so that the child could feel the love of his father and have a better life, so she could rest assured after death.
However, the Li family coldly refused to admit that the child was theirs, so Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with the child and beg bitterly.
At this time, the iron gate slowly opened, several people came out with umbrellas, the leading man and the boy are somewhat similar, he is the boy's father Li Zhe.
"Here! Stinky woman, this amount of money is enough for you to live a good life, "Li Zhe frowned and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must stay with him, he is your son! "
Li Zhe refused, and then said coldly, "Do you want the money or not? "
When she heard it, Zhao Meiling was already in tears and pear blossoms, and she shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe Leng groaned, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, kneeling on the ground, embraced Li Zhe's thigh and said, "Zhe! "
"Slap it!"
Before Zhao Meiling finished, Li Zhe slapped her in the face, "Let go! You stinky woman. "
When the boy next to him saw his mother being beaten, he rushed to hold Li Zhe's thigh and shouted, "Dad! Don't hit Mom."
In fact, the boy didn't know who his father was since he was born, and his mother didn't say anything about it until Zhao Meiling took out a photo of Li Zhe and showed it to the boy, and the boy knew he had a father, and he was so happy that he almost jumped up.
But now, he doesn't understand why his father doesn't want his mother and beats her.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy holding his thigh, looked disgusted, kicked the little boy out with one foot, "Who is your father, dead, wild, kind! "
The boy was kicked out and fell to the ground, curled up and covered his stomach with a painful face, which was far more than a five-year-old boy could bear, and tears rolled out of his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, hurriedly released Li Zhe, ran to pick up the boy, nervously and concernedly asked, "Are you okay, my son? "
The little boy looked at his worried mother, squeezed his mouth, fought back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and son, walked into the iron gate, next to a gray hair like a housekeeper, picked up the check, handed it to Zhao Meiling, sympathetically advised, "You'd better take it!"
Zhao Meiling shook her head, held the little boy in her arms, and slowly disappeared into the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the mother and son's back, sighed deeply, turned and went into the house, slowly closing the iron door.
Four years later! Before she died, Zhao Meiling called the nine-year-old boy, who had grown up a lot, to the bedside, rubbed his head gently, smiled weakly and said, "You should study hard and have a good job in the future, and don't resent the Li family, don't resent your father, promise me? "
The little boy fought back his tears and gave a serious nod.
As she watched the little boy nodding her head and agreeing, Zhao Meiling slowly closed her eyes forever with a serene smile on her face.
At two o'clock at night, a bright moon hangs high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shines on the earth, so that it is not dark around.
"Boom! "
There was a deafening noise in the sky, and Zhao Fu was startled and looked up at the sky, only to see that the whole sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of fire, emitting countless colors of light, dragging a long tail, like a meteor falling from the sky.
"Bang! "
With a loud noise, a meteor emitting seven-colored light fell in front of Zhao Fu, and the glaring light made Zhao Fu block it with his hands, and then the bright light dissipated, and a hedron one finger long and two fingers thick floated silently in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu came forward curiously, held the hedron, and the hedron floated in mid-air and was held by Zhao Fu without any reaction.
At this time, the people who had been sleeping were also awakened by a series of loud noises, opened their doors or windows, looked at the countless hedrons floating in mid-air, and began to rush out of the house to seize the hedrons, Zhao Fu did not stay in place, and hurried back to his home.
In a single-room rental room, Zhao Fu carefully surveyed the hedron, if only by selling, this hedron has no gemstone can be compared, if the quantity is rare, it is worth a city at all, but the number of keys fell from the sky is too much, to say the least, tens of billions of appearance, so the hedron may not be worth at all.
"The detection host is the primary intelligent body, the beginning of soul binding... "
Ding! Soul binding is successful, and we begin to travel to the apocalyptic world.
After the sound, Zhao Fu's eyes blacked out and he fainted on the ground. "Hong Dali, a 22-year-old male, an orphan, died because he bravely rescued two children who were about to be hit by a car. After the study of the relevant authorities, it was decided to posthumously seal Hong Dali as a hero and an outstanding university student in the province."
"I don't want to go with you to Hong's house to be married!" Tang Muxin buried his head in the pillow, desperately kicking his white calves: "Hung Dali is a famous waste of the city, humiliating the face of the Hong family, and the person is crooked, the brain is not bright or a standard loser, I don't want to find such a person as my fiancé!"
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Rui Si, chairman of Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is multi-talented, Bo Gutong, not to mention beautiful, beautiful, a beautiful lady, a combination of the spirit of the world, especially cooked good food, the standard hall, the kitchen, the big bed, in school I do not know how many boys' dream lover.
But today, she heard that her father said that he would take him to the famous loser Hong Dali's family to be married, which made her how she could bear it: "If his parents had not spoiled her, a single seedling in a thousand hectares of land, he was such a waste, would have been driven out of the Hong family and self-destruction, how could there be such a chance to be a loser everywhere all day long? "
After listening to her daughter's words, Tang Rui Si, sitting at the head of the bed, showed a wry smile on her face, but said, "Fragrant, I can't help it. "
Your marriage with Hong Dali was decided by your grandpa himself, and although he was a loser, it wasn't a big problem, was it?
Tang Rui Si wears a blue-gray vest, inside is a spotless white sweatshirt, wears a simple bow tie at the collar, has a light stubble on the lips, carries a bronze pipe in his hands, a short black hair is meticulously combed back, shiny, the whole image is quite good, but the original bright eyes are now full of helplessness and reluctance.
Speaking of which, if he was not really forced to be desperate, how could he be willing to give away his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dali is a wonderful work in the world, the only thing he likes to do or can do is two words: loser.
His most famous sentence is: "I must be a loser, don't losers waste my parents' money-making talents? "
This sentence can be called the joke of the whole Tianjing City, many parents will teach their children to say: "If you dare to learn from Hong, the loser, see if I don't break your legs!"
Therefore, Tang Muxin would have such a big reaction, it is indeed reasonable.
"It's also... "Tang Rui Si thought with a frown, and suddenly his eyes lighted up, saying, "Xinxin, what do you think of this? We'll make an appointment first, wait for Dad's company to return to normal, and then we'll find an excuse to withdraw our parents. This time we're over budget for research, once the funds keep up, as long as the research of this project is successful, it's definitely a sensational event in the world, wait for us to calm down, and then try to withdraw, his family shouldn't say anything more? "
Tang Muxin sobbed: "It's easy to be engaged and difficult to withdraw, his family is one of the world's top 500 enterprises, how can it be so easy? "
I have to say, Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family collapses, her fate will be no better. The world is like this, the law of the jungle. When you are strong, no one will dare to touch you, but when you are really in a state of ruin, there will be no fewer people who will come to fall down.
For example, the grand master of the Liu family who has been pestering her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way except this method, only reluctantly climbed up and said, "Then, then go and try it first, Wow, Dad, in the future you must remember to withdraw, I don't want to marry that loser!"
"Eh, okay, for the sake of my family Xinxin, Dad will try his best. "Tang Rui Si sighed and patted Tang Muxin on the shoulder: "Xinxin, let's go."
Hong sat on the bed with his eyes dazed and his mind in a turmoil.
The environment was strange, and the memory in his head was quite a problem, and now he could only barely recall the shrill sound of the brakes, and the rest was a mess of memories that didn't belong to him at all.
"Am I dead, here, and where?" Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong thought to himself, "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live. So, where is this?"
He looked around for a while and thought, "The most urgent thing is to find out the current situation. "
"One, I'm dead or alive now. Two, where is this place and who is my identity. Three, what should I do next? "
"Now let's look at the first point," Hong vigorously squeezed a small piece of oil skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and said, "I feel pain, so I should be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and top of his head: "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the scope of human beings."
"Then the second question is, where is this place and who is my identity?" Hong Dali looked around at the reinforced concrete house structure, snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD display in the corner of the room: "It's modern society, but I haven't seen the stars on the walls around me, and all kinds of toy models are never heard of.
There was no one around, so Hong stood up carefully and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak, thin like a bamboo pole, I really don't know when it will suddenly die. "
When he opened the computer, Hong vigorously opened several web sites at random, and the content displayed was very different from that on Earth, but at least he understood a few things: "First, the characters of this world or this country are still Chinese characters. Second, it is indeed a parallel space, and many things are different from the Earth, but not much different.
I don't have an ID card?" I thought about it, but I was quickly relieved: "Hehe, look at the age of this body should not be very high, about 17 or 18 years old, the ID card may have been handled, but more likely it has not been issued, after all, the world is different from the earth, some nuances are normal."
"Big loser system binding success, the current level: Level 1."
When the system tone was introduced here, Hong Dali suddenly saw a little person in his mind, who should look like himself.
"The host's name: Hong Dali."
Sexual ability: 32. Note: Each index of normal people is 100. "
Hong looked stunned: "The big loser system? Is this thing real or fake?
Luckily, there is no way out, Hong Dali is longing to commit suicide, the system's metal tone again came: "Explanation: every loser 100,000 yuan (RMB), you can get a property point.
When all the properties of the host reach the normal level, the Big Loser system will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added, please look forward to it. "
"Can you get attribute points? "At this time, there is really nothing better than to improve their attributes, Hong listened with a big smile, "can you really get attribute points through the loser, let yourself become like a normal person?"
Although the sound of the system is still cold, it is almost like a song in my ears: "Yes. "
Hong was so excited that he almost jumped up: "I want to spend! I want to lose! "
"Next, please ask the host to take the first task: the first loser. The task requirements: the loser before midnight today at least 100,000 yuan.
"Current loser amount: 0."
"Damn it, it's already eight o'clock in the evening! There's only about four hours left, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose! "
Just as I thought of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, a maid in her forties made a slight bow to Hong Dali, and said softly, "Master Dali, Master and Mrs. Dali let you go, please come with me."
"Would you buy me a game cabin? "Jiang Fei asked his father with anticipation.
"Xiao Fei, now you are in high school, you can't be addicted to games like before!"
"Mom! This game is different! This is a God's work that has been carefully made by Saatchi Company for thirteen years, and is called the second world of mankind! "
The game called "Dawnlight" mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in the history of mankind, it is not only a model of virtual real games, the degree of realism is close to 100%, but also through a brand-new technology, can let the player experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physically, but in the spirit can experience twenty-four hours of completely different magic life!
"This game is being promoted in the country! It is not deceptive, this game not only will not affect learning, but also can make people have a better rest!"
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
"I said last time, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework in twenty seconds, then next month's pocket money will be cut by fifty percent! "Dad said with a straight face.
"Old and stubborn!"
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that he didn't have to talk about it, his home conditions are good, my father is definitely not reluctant to buy this game cabin, but my father's brain is dead, I absolutely don't believe that playing games will not affect my study! "Fei Ge, how about it? Tonight's Dawn will be officially opened, have you prepared the game cabin?"
As soon as the bell rang, after the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei picked up his shoulder and asked.
Don't mention it, I can't play with you this time! "Jiang Fei gave a wry smile!
The brothers are pointing at you!"
The little fat man Zhao Feng said quickly, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in school, Jiang Fei's senior high school Class 9 is the key class of the school, but Jiang Fei's grades are medium, his grades are not good, sports is not good, and he is not good at interpersonal communication, so he is definitely a standard transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree, what can I do? "Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, but he said nothing to his only friend.
"Should the brothers pool their money to buy one for you?" Zhao Feng said, because the conditions are similar to Jiang Fei's, both are the kind of guy who is not outstanding in all aspects, so the relationship between the two transparent people who are not concerned by teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"I hope so!"
Zhao Feng nods his head.
Jiang Fei likes to play games since he was a child, especially this kind of realistic games, as a boy, the man who doesn't want to fight swords? A man with a three-foot sword, to make great achievements, this is every boy's dream, but in peacetime, and in a highly developed society, not to mention there is no war, even if there is war, it is to press the button, so if you want to enjoy the passion of fighting, you can only experience it in virtual games!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless, since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been ordered by his father to limit entertainment, all the game equipment at home is sealed, online games are not to talk about!
After school, Jiang Fei went home listless, and although it was only about six o'clock in the evening, it was already winter, so it was very dark.
Thinking that today was the day of the opening of Dawn, Jiang Fei angrily locked himself in his room! At about ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework. He lay on his back and looked at the wall clock approaching ten o'clock, feeling a little uncomfortable.
The opening time of Dawn is 10 o'clock this evening, and then every day from 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning, running for eight hours a day, not only does not delay the normal life of the player, but also allows the player to fully experience the 24 hours of game time! "Hey, such a great game does not have my share!"
As Jiang Fei muttered, he subconsciously rubbed the ring on his index finger with his hand.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei's mouth was wide open, and when he looked at the ring on his hand, he was a little speechless!
"Oops! "
A flash of white light flashed, and Jiang Fei saw a flower in front of him. When his vision was clear again, it was no longer his room!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of Dawn! No. 34784 novice assistant for you!"
A crisp female voice came into Jiang Fei's ear!
"Dawn? Is this the landing interface of Dawn?"
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface! "answered the novice assistant.
Jiang Fei is still a little hard to imagine, he has no game cabin at all, how can he enter the game?
Maybe this is my dream! Maybe I was too tired after doing my homework, so I lay down in bed and fell asleep, including the mysterious ring just now, I'm afraid it's all part of the dream, I think about it every day, I dream at night, maybe I want to play this game too much!
"The liar! The big liar!"
An angry petite drinker, followed by the sound of the soles of his feet running away on the blue stone ground.
Zhang Han held out his hands helplessly: "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher of the college... just want you to be my student! And, even if I'm a liar, why add a'big' word? "
After muttering, he remembered what the political and educational director had said, and Zhang Han rubbed his eyebrows: "The 17th! If I can't recruit a student today, I can roll up and go home tomorrow! "
Zhang Hanben is not a person of this world, but an ordinary university librarian of the earth, only remember the fire, and then... no more, wake up to this world again.
Similar to what is described in the novel, martial arts is respect, strength is king!
I thought I could pass through a waste wood, but was rejected from marriage, and then I hit back and sang all the way... I seem to have thought too much, only to find that it was not a student, but... teacher!
The saddest teacher in the whole college!
Other people's classrooms were overcrowded, too crowded to sit down, while his classroom, there was not a single one, he was hard to pull in a few, and finally even called several "cheaters," turned around and ran away!
The reason for this is that the guy who was pierced by his own soul, the lowest strength among the teachers, but also very poor vision, can not see anything, the key...
This is the same as the dead in the hospital, the reputation is greatly damaged, people spit on, even the new students, one by one, respect and distance, afraid of falling into his hands, be taught to be half dead!
There were no students, and they were criticized. Last year's teacher evaluation, the college was the lowest in the whole college, and even got the only zero point in history.
Depressed, I borrowed wine to worry, and as a result, I hung up as I wished, I took the opportunity to cross over.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum that if he could not enroll another student in his class this year, he would be expelled from the teaching staff!
Today, seventeen new students passed by his classroom, and as a result, when they heard the name, they all ran away without exception, like a little girl who met a strange maize, running as fast as she could.
"It seems that we must find a way to trick one!"
When I was thinking about how to open my mouth and pull someone, I saw a girl with a dull face showing her head from the door.
"Is this Mr. Lu Xun's classroom?"
The voice is sweet, cute, beautiful, and pleasant.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the college, the classroom is full every time, countless people come to admire the name.
"Just her! "Seeing someone throw himself into the net, his eyes hung brightly.
He recalled the various poses he had seen in his previous life, sat quietly on his seat, and posed as a worldly master: "Do you want to worship him as a teacher? "
The girl nods her head like a sparrow, and her black eyes are full of admiration: "I heard that Mr. Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian College, the students of the professor are all very strong, everyone is proud to join his class!"
"No matter how good his words are, they don't conform to your cultivation theory, and they won't make progress, and if they don't, they'll regress! Teacher is not famous, and if they conform to your theory, they can make rapid progress and make great progress in cultivation!"
"That's right... I've heard my brother say similar things! "The girl was stunned for a moment, her beautiful eyes were a little confused: "But I don't know what kind of classroom I'm suitable for!"
Seeing her take the bait, she hung her eyes and hesitated for a moment, Marx, Enkos and other sages came to mind one after another, pretending to be awkward: "Meeting is predestination, so I'm also a teacher of this college, I can help you see your roots, talents, temperament, and help you recommend a suitable teacher!"
I didn't expect to meet the teacher at random, so generous, the girl was excited and nodding her head.
"You show me the repair first, so I can see it!"
He hung his eyes half open and half closed, as if he didn't care.
"Yes!"
Hoo hoo hoo!
For a moment, the boxing style roared in the room, and the whole human breath, condensed but not dispersed, awe-inspiring but not visible, represented that she had an excellent foundation.
"Okay, I can see that you cultivate hard, solid foundation, excellent talent, is a rare genius!" After a set of fists, Zhang Han nodding with satisfaction.
He learned it from fortune-tellers on Earth, and his words are all golden, wide-ranging, so that people can't hear the error, but instead call it accurate.
"Teacher, I had an injury on my leg, the doctor said, it's basically the same as the waste... "The girl interrupted his chatter, some doubt in his eyes.
"Injured... "Zhang Han old face blushed, but, thick-skinned, others can not see it, continued to nonsense: "Do you think I didn't see it? Just now, when you exerted your power, I knew it!
Anyway, it's all trickery. If you can talk nonsense, you can talk nonsense, and you'll trick a disciple first.
"Opportunity? Teacher, what kind of chance? "The girl's eyes brightened.
After her leg injury, she always felt inferior to others and had a low self-esteem, but she didn't expect to be lucky.
"This opportunity can make you soar into the sky, become the first newborn is not too much, after all, you are very talented, is a unique genius, but... "Zhang Han Haikou repeatedly, almost did not take out a "Tathagata God's hand."
When she heard that she could be the first freshman, and praised her as a genius, the girl couldn't help but look hot on her face and asked, "But what? "
"But... "Zhang Han sighed, a talented man was about to be buried and exclaimed: "There are not many teachers in the whole college who can see this opportunity!
"Won't accept students? "The girl had great hopes, and her eyes dimmed a little when she heard this, and then she thought of something and jumped up: "They don't accept students, then the teacher you... can't accept it?"
"Of course I still receive it, but, as you can see, I'm indifferent to fame and wealth, and I don't have so much time!"
Puff!
Before the words were finished, the girl prostrated herself to the ground: "I know Mr. Gao Jie, please accept me as an apprentice! I will cultivate well and not lose face with the teacher! "
"Students will never disturb the teacher! "Seeing him a little reluctant, the girl hastened to nod her head, looking sincere.
"I don't have many students, I may not be able to compare with other teachers in terms of resources, and I will be criticized... "Zhang Han added.
"So... I heard that refining resources is very important... "The girl hesitated.
Teachers receiving resources in colleges are linked to many conditions such as the grades and number of students taught, and if resources are insufficient, it will be difficult to make progress in cultivation.
"Cough, I said this on purpose to test you, since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I am also willing to accept you! "Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Han immediately interrupted, hastened to say: "authentication! "
"Is it... so fast?"
Unexpectedly, the teacher's face changed like a book, it was outrageous, the girl was a little stunned, took a token suspended to represent the identity, was considering whether to verify, before she saw the calm teacher Zhang, had already pulled her palm, took out a sharp knife and gently stroked, a drop of blood fell on the jade plate.
Hum!
The light flashed.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't the teacher just say that he should think about it, ignoring fame and wealth? How could he move so fast, and... the knives are ready?
"From now on, you are my student! "Drops of blood to admit the master, Zhang Han then relieved, once again recovered the appearance of a master: "What is your name?"
"I'll tell you, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it couldn't be changed, the girl didn't say more, nodding her head with a germination on her face.
"Well, take your identity card, go to get your bedding, books, and find your place to live! Tomorrow's official class, come here to find me! "
Zhang Hanging and waving his hand.
"Yes! "Wang Ying nods and turns to leave.
"Successful trick on the last one!"
Seeing her become his own student, Zhang Han was relieved and smiled.
It's not easy. If I hadn't seen a lot of tricks on the Internet, I'm afraid it would be hard to succeed today.
With a student, you can avoid the fate of being expelled, Zhang Han relaxed, and immediately felt that the whole person's spirit was much smoother in an instant, and the obsession of the predecessor circling in your mind was also slowly disappearing.
"Take it easy, since you've passed through, I'll live for you!"
Before that, Zhang Han died because he couldn't recruit students, and many of them were reluctant. Now that there are students, the last insistence has vanished, and until now, Zhang Han has mastered this body completely.
Boom!
Fully in control of the body, Zhang Han was trying to trick a few students next, when he felt a shock in his head, a sound of Huang Zhong Dalu sounded loudly.
Boom!
All kinds of mysterious languages, shocked him a little dizzy, and then came to mind a huge palace, on which five big letters glittered.
Tiandao Library!
Push the door and walk in, countless bookshelves stand, all kinds of books are endless, a glance can not see the end.
"Library? Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, and I won't be in this world, it's the same! "
Other people's gift package, not the grandpa, is the system, all kinds of good things forced by the bull to burst, but he is a library, Zhang Han only felt a dark in front of him, almost fainted.
The library? The dry bird? Will there be a fight, someone throws a sword, and I throw a book?
"What are the books?"
In desperation, Zhang Han reached out and grasped the books on the bookshelf to see what the library was doing, but when he grasped them, he found that his palm went directly through the bookshelf and caught a blank.
"You're playing with me? I gave it to a library, but I can't get any books, I can't read them, what are you doing? "
Zhang Han's face was speechless and he wanted to cry without tears.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Hey? Where's my tattoo!
Zhao Yu pulled up his sleeves and looked at his two white and tender arms in surprise. Before, his arms were tattooed with two teeth and claws, a domineering blue dragon!
How come... it's all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found himself sitting in a glaringly lit office, with a small office partition on the left and right.
At the moment, the phone kept ringing, paper and documents were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were speeding through the hall, all looking anxious.
At this time, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket quickly came up and greeted the crowd, "Chief Qu Ping now tells us about the case of the electric baton strong * rape case, tonight will start action, everyone listen! "
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was covered with words and a number of photos.
Hearing the greeting, a large number of staff quickly gathered around, casually pull a chair, sitting in front of the white board to listen carefully.
Zhao Yu did not move, but was still sitting in his seat.
At the moment, he was still in a great shock, and he touched his right ear and it was intact! His right ear had been split in two by a little bastard in a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to look at his face in a mirror, but suddenly he saw a photo on his desk. There was a handsome young man in police uniform, who looked exactly like him!
Grandma is a bear! Shocked, a stream of strange memories like the Yellow River flooded into his mind. Zhao Yu gradually realized that... he encountered the legendary - crossing!
Zhao Yu clearly remembers that he was the gold medal fighter of the Qinglong Gang, a ruffian king who fought desperately! Although his real name is Zhao Yu, people in the river and lake prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma is a bear!
Zhao Yu was startled again, and he finally remembered that he had been executed by lethal injection!
But, reading and reading... why did you come here?
Did... I really cross it?
And it's still seamless, and there's no rebirth at all?
As new memories poured in, he was surprised to find that this was a parallel world similar to the previous one, and his current identity, is a detective of the Major Crimes Squad mobile team, is actually a policeman!
The hall where he is now is nowhere else, but the office of the police station!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes, such a huge contrast is really unimaginable. A senior ruffian turned into a serious crime team detective, this... where to reason?
He subconsciously touched his head. Before, he had a big bald head because he had been slashed several times and his hair was always different, so he had a big bald head, which seemed to be fierce. But now he had flowing black hair, and he looked like a handsome boy.
"Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of electric baton rape in our city... "At the moment, a short-haired, big-eyed female detective is telling people about the case.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information of the detective from her memory. She was the leader of Group B of the Major Crimes Team, but she was a stable person with a high rate of solving crimes, and she was a red man in front of the leaders. Generally, she would preside over any major case that required the cooperation of the whole team.
"The victims were all beautifully dressed young women, and all had bad lifestyle problems," said Qu Ping, the group leader, "the place of the incident was near bars, cabaret and other weather venues, the time of the crime was after midnight."
"According to the victim's statement, the offender first followed the victim into an unoccupied alleyway, then stunned him with an electric baton, and then raped him. After the crime, the offender would urinate on the victim! "
Hearing the word "pee", the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu took a look and saw that this person was Liu Changhu, the deputy leader of the mobile team of the serious crimes unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person had no less than Zhao Yu's tribe, and every day he was asked to deliver a letter and pour tea, just like the envoy called people.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a ruffian king, but a big boy with a weak personality, who has just finished his internship to become a regular police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but also many senior colleagues will make fun of him and arrange some jobs for him that should not belong to him.
Now Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon, how can he bear to be shouted at? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden standup startled Liu Changhu, and even the group leader Quping had to pause.
Who knows, just as everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a female voice like a silver bell suddenly preempted Zhao Yu's head. A girl with a ponytail, a little fat body, and big glasses appeared in front of the crowd.
The girl was a newly assigned trainee clerk from the serious crime unit, named Li Beni. The girl was a flower idiot, and within a month of contact, she fell in love with Zhao Yu.
Although Zhao Yu is weak and often bullied, he is a talented man, one meter seven and eight in size, Yushu is windy, young and handsome, and really has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being shouted at, Li Beanie rushed forward to relieve the siege: "Captain Liu, I'll come, I'll come! I'm still in the internship period, I'll naturally do these jobs! "
After saying that, Li Beni smiled at Zhao Yu and went to the pantry in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu didn't have a fit, so he could patiently sit down again and continue to think about his crossing. Although he crossed, his memory was very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was lying on the execution couch. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed and did not kill at all! The person killed was the owner of a real estate group, and Zhao Yu only beat him according to the instructions of his superiors, which could not have killed him.
Besides, even if he was beaten to death, it would be manslaughter and should not be sentenced to murder! So, his death sentence was a conspiracy of others!
When he thought of this, Zhao Yu was full of anger and his fists were clenched. If he could find the person who framed him in the future, he would have to make them pay twice as much!
At this time, Li Beni had brewed the coffee and shared a cup with each of her colleagues. The little girl's face was always full of enthusiasm, and every time she gave out a cup, she would kindly encourage her with words such as "hard work," "come on," and so on, which won the favor of her colleagues.
"Sergeant Zhao, there are two packs of sugar in this cup! Tonight is doomed to stay awake, you must stick to it! "
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to react, Li Beni happily put the plate on it.
At this time, the group leader Qu Ping had finished telling the case, and the head of the serious crime team, Captain Jin Zhenbang, spoke instead. Captain Jin was over 50 years old, with white temples, and was an old man who did not smile and was very serious.
Captain Jin said aloud, "There have been three electric baton cases, and one more will be classified as a serial incident. Not only the top, we can't wear this big hat!
Therefore, everyone should work hard to solve the case in the shortest possible time! "So... Team A sends someone to the scene of the crime to investigate, since the offender is following the victim, he must have appeared in the bar and cabaret where the victim was before, call out all the surveillance there, must find this person!
"Yes!"
"Group B, you are mainly responsible for the comparison of evidence!" Captain Jin ordered, "The criminal has no record of the case, the line of blood can not work. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue, although the police can not find a match, but you can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check and compare, as long as this person has a physical examination or has been in the hospital, you will be able to find him!"
"Yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the offender, the mobile phone signal at the scene, the only victim who has seen the offender's appearance, these clues can not be ignored, all have to be followed up! "
"Yes!"
"Okay, each group will arrange a plan of action, if there is no problem, then let's start as soon as possible!" said Captain Jin, closed his folder, and then turned to leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!"
When the crowd looked back, they found that the person speaking was not someone else, but Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also stunned and asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu? What's your problem? "
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said, "I'm not feeling well, go home first, you can play by yourself! "
Part 1, Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the director's office of Donghai high-level private hospital.
"Slap," a thick case was slammed on the table, Dean Lin looked iron-blue, angry, "Han Yun, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Ling Yun Group, he owns 40 (percent) shares of our hospital, you must give him priority to detoxification!"
Faced with the dean's monstrous anger, Han Yun put his hands in the pockets of his white coat and was calm. "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li's venom is chronic, I'm not allowed to jump the queue here for non-emergency situations. "
She is pure and beautiful, with big eyes and a pair of small pear vortices. She is famous for her amazing talent in acupuncture at a young age, and is a rare master of detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, phytotoxins, chemical toxins or human endotoxins, all of which are her strengths.
"You know, this is Ling Yun! "The dean was so angry that he shot the case.
"Enough is enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal before doctors, only men and women are divided. Han Yun, I tell you, arrange detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today on, get out of the medical profession!"
I thought Han Yun would be afraid, but she was still calm and calm, serious attitude, "Dean Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, only two kinds of people, I want to save and I don't want to save, Mr. Li I don't save, please ask for another good! "
When she said that, she smiled politely and turned to leave. Her seemingly thin body was graceful and calm, and there was a kind of pride in the quietness and beauty that could not be ignored. However, when Xuan Hanyu opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
"Han Yun, you dare to talk to me like this, you stop me!"
As she said, she dropped the case clip on the table on the back of her head, and Han was stunned, only to feel a sense of humid heat slowly flowing down the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the kingdom of Tianning.
Han Yun wakes up in a daze in the sedan and hears the festivities around him, the sound of Suo gongs and drums playing one after another, and the blackness in front of him.
What is going on?
Han Yun tore off the things on his head, and suddenly gasped, this... Isn't this Xipa? Subconsciously looking up and down, found that he was wearing a phoenix crown, like a bride who was getting married... drunk!
Han Yun's headache was caused by the turbulence of the sedan, and at this time, strange memories flooded into her mind. Undoubtedly, she crossed it, and as soon as she crossed it, she would get married!
The original owner was the legitimate daughter of the Han family of the Tianning medical family, also called Han Yun, because her mother's medical skills saved the life of the empress at that time, who is now the queen dowager, and was accused of marrying the Seven Princes at that time, who is now the King of Qin Long Feiye, which was also rumored as a good story at that time, and the status of the Han family soared.
However, no one knows that Han Yun died his mother at birth, and also grew up to be a waste material ugly girl who does not know medical skills, so the delay in marriage has become a taboo for the King of Qin, but a few days ago the King of Qin annoyed the emperor, the emperor issued a paper order to choose a date before the end of the month to complete the marriage.
King Long Feiyue of Qin was the only surviving prince in the battle for the throne. He was only in his early twenties, but he was the only emperor in terms of generation, and he was the first high-ranking and powerful man in Tianning.
The King of Qin's residence was in the south of the city, and the Han family was in the north of the city, so the sedan had to pass through the city from the north to the south, and the King of Qin married, but even though he did not show up, he attracted thousands of people to the alleys, causing a sensation in the city.
When Han Yun was sorting out these memory information, the joy suddenly stopped, only to hear Xiba shouted, "It's not good, it's not good! "
Chapter 1
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's going to be zero, get up and eat some dumplings. "
Feng Yu felt the voice was strange, but he felt very kind. He answered in a daze, opened his eyes, and saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
"Sister? "
"Wake up, wash your face quickly. I told you not to drink, you have to drink, you fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival evening, "Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is today New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu looked around in confusion, a hut of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched bedding, an old wooden table, a 20-watt incandescent lamp on top of his head, emitting a dim yellow light, and old newspapers on the walls, all of which were national events that he could not remember.
Isn't this the old house on his family's farm when he was a child, but the house was demolished with the construction of a small town, and how did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to find that this was definitely not a joke, because his hands had become smaller and his arms had become thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood on the door frame with the mark he made with a knife every New Year's Day, the highest line, in 1988, 166 centimeters.
Is it 1988? He hasn't graduated from junior high school yet?
He pinched himself so hard that he almost screamed in pain. Wasn't it a dream?
Feng Yu opens the door and comes out, and his mother is cooking dumplings in a cauldron in the kitchen. He lives in the hut, and the kitchen is the door, and on the other side of the kitchen is the living room, which is called the hall on the farm.
"Get up, will you drink again? "Zhang Muhua looked at his son with pity.
Feng Yu looked at her mother with black hair, and her eyes were moist.
"Mother, you've been working hard."
"This child, what do you say? Hurry to wash your face, watch TV in the house for a while, the dumplings will be ready immediately. "Zhang Muhua heard the hard sentence, the heart is also very happy, the son is grown up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. As soon as he was able to earn money, his father was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died within three months, without even spending a penny of his earnings.
Feng Yu felt very uncomfortable for a long time because he wanted to nourish his son and didn't stay with him.
"Dad. "Feng Xingtai turned to look at his son: "Get up, still dizzy? Watch TV, folk dance get-together, it's happy. "
"Dad, I want to have a drink with you later. "Seeing his father's anger on his face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Beer is fine."
I haven't had a few drinks with my father in my life, and Feng Yu now has a strong desire to drink with my father again.
"I haven't got a long memory, well, drink a little later, I think you can get up tomorrow and go to the New Year! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer. "
Feng Danying helplessly shook his head and turned to get the beer and cup.
There is also a single bed in the hall with bedding on it. Feng Danying lives in the inner room with her mother when she comes back from school. Feng Xingtai sleeps in this bed, but three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
On the west wall of the living room, there is a three-door stand-up wardrobe with two suitcases on top of it. On top of a solid wooden table, there is a fourteen-inch black-and-white TV with the Spring Festival evening on the TV.
In the middle of the living room was a folding round table, which was full of dishes and chopsticks. There were eight dishes, but all were leftovers from the evening. There was chicken, fish and elbows, and all eight dishes were meat dishes, not a single vegetarian dish.
Feng Yu didn't watch TV, but went to the front of the wardrobe and took a careful look in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can be sure now that he is born again!
My mother cooked the dumplings quickly, and Feng Yu and Feng Danying went to the kitchen to help bring them up. After all four of them sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up the chopsticks.
"Xiao Yu, you still drink! "Zhang Muhua stared at Feng Yu.
"Mother, let me drink a little more in the New Year."
Feng Xingtai also helped him say a few words, and Zhang Muhua shook his head and let them go. Feng Yu also attentively poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, and the whole family must have a drink.
"Happy New Year, father, mother, sister, toast!"
Feng Yu ate a bite of the leftovers on the table, and they were all very tasty. This year, there were no hormonal additives in later generations. The fish and rabbits were wild, and the chickens and pigs were all raised at home. The two men ate these dishes with dumplings, and one of them drank a bottle of beer, but Feng Xingtai would not let them have more.
After eating, Feng Yu washed and washed, and went back to his hut to lie down. As he lay in bed, he tossed and turned, and couldn't help but think of his life before he was born again.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his forties. After resigning from a securities company, he made his own investment life.
He had a wife and no children, and his father died of illness at an early age, and his mother lived with him.
He remembers that in the spring of 2015, in order to take his wife abroad to treat infertility, he wanted to earn more money, so he mortgaged all the family's savings, including the house and car, and borrowed a large amount of money, all into the stock market, according to his prediction, this is a bull market, fools can make money.
At first, the situation was very good, and his investment quickly doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, wanting to make more profits, and once again doubled, he would do nothing for the rest of his life, and he would have no worries about food and clothing.
When the stock market rose to 5000 points, he was greedy, like many people, and he thought it would continue to rise. The stock market did rise a little at first, but the stock market soon took a dive, because he used high leverage and had no additional funds, but he lost a lot of money. After paying back the borrowed money, he became poor, his wife didn't know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he didn't know how to go home to face his family.
He went bankrupt, drank a lot of wine that day, and then accidentally fell on the road in front of a lot of people and was hit by a big truck.
This should not be considered suicide, he put in the accident insurance, should be able to pay millions of dollars, enough to redeem the house and car, and can leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembers looking at the truck speeding by and thinking that if God could give him a chance to come back, he would not die so poorly, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But I didn't expect that God would really give him a chance to come again!
Since God let him come again, the regrets of his past life will never be seen again in this life. He will become a millionaire, he will become a legend in the investment world!
"Stop shouting, Xiaoyu, and go to sleep."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted, complaining about her husband and letting her son drink at night, which is nonsense.
Hearing her mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly.
Monday, May 20, 2019.
Spring ends with summer solstice.
This season, the temperature difference between day and night in the southern part of the Yangtze River becomes very large. During the day, I wear underpants and become a hot dog; at night, I have to huddle in the bed and become a cold bird.
Jiangnan University Town.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, and the computer table was pulled to the bedside so that he could watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang doesn't like to play truant - it was hot and muggy in the middle of the night last night, and in his sleep he made a move to "shuanglong out to sea" and kicked off the quilt.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who had only a small pair of underpants all over his body, was distressed. In his sleep, he groped with his hands on the bed, looking for the quilt, but could not touch it. Finally, he shrunk into the shape of a skin shrimp, shivering under the cold wind at midnight.
When the sun rises, Song Shuhang has become a member of the seasonal cold army.
His roommate has asked for leave for him in today's class.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The fever faded, and his body was still a little weak, so he couldn't go to class at all. So he had to stay alone in the dormitory and watch a movie.
On the screen, the progress bar of the film is slowly advancing. But Song Shuhang didn't see the content of the film at all.
"Isn't the effect of the medicine over yet? I'm so sleepy. "He yawned and felt his eyelids a little heavy.
"Drop by drop~" At this time, the chat software in the bottom right corner of the computer beats.
This is a prompt for someone to add him as a friend or to join a group.
"Who will add me? "Song Shuhang murmured, he reached out his hand in the bottom right corner of the computer touch screen and tapped, prompting the message to pop up.
[Huang Shan Zhenjun (*****) asked to add you as a friend.] Additional message: none.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who, such a strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate? "Song Shuhang said secretly, thinking of those guys in the class who were already in college but were still in a youthful fantasy period. If they were, they would have such strange nicknames.
Thinking of this, he clicked'agree'.
Then, another system message pops up.
[Huang Shan Zhenjun invites you to join the "Jiuzhou No. 1 Group," do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to agree.
"Shushan is under great pressure" agreed to join the "Jiuzhou No. 1 Group."
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to your friends!] There is also a system smiley face.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang agreed to turn off the prompt and group chat window - he is now sleepy, who has the energy to care what group he added?
Anyway, his group setting has always been "no message, only show the number," group chat will not pop up to disturb him, only show the number of chats after the group.
When he is sober, he can flip through his chat records, and he will know what group he joined, and the chat records of the members of the group will not be lost.
The film's progress bar is still tenaciously advancing, but Song Shuhang's consciousness is more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 group, after seeing a new person join, a member of the group of divers emerged. Beihe scattered people: "Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Taoist friend to come in? I haven't added a new person for more than a year? "
Another ID is "Su Shi A Qi" quickly replied: "There is a new Taoist friend? Which district of China is Taoist friend? What is the number of the road? How many products have been repaired? "
This series of questions, I always feel that there is something wrong?
"Is it a fairy? If so, I'll tell you three times and take a picture! "
"Sanlang Brother, are you really a goldfish? "Beihe Sanren sighed, "You don't want to die again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun adds a big elder to come in?"
Sanlang is a guy who is good at everything, kind and helpful, so he is very popular - he likes to spend money on it, and he is good at it.
However, this guy's luck value is so low that it's outrageous. Every time he dies involuntarily, it's always the elders who offend. These idle elders are worried and have no fun, and naturally they're happy to toss the three waves of knives that come to the door.
"Kneeling and begging not to mention the words'big seniors', there is a shadow in the heart of this seat. "San Dao made a row of "tearful face" expression.
Four years ago, his broken mouth offended a beautiful "big senior" and was tossed miserably... the big senior tossed him for a whole year and four months. You heard me right, it was a whole year and four months!
As soon as Sanlang said this, the crowd erupted with a series of bad smiles - undisguised, straightforward gloating.
There were eight people in the group who showed their online status, and six of them all popped up with a row of smiling faces.
"You people who are gloating over the misfortune, this seat remembers each of you, don't let this seat meet you, or you will have to taste the experience of this seat's seventy-two-way fast knife! "Furious Dao Sanlang hates to say. He is very confident in his fast knife, just now the six guys who laugh, none of them is his opponent.
The Three Waves of the Sword have just finished.
He has cultivated deeply, and has reached the state of 5 Pinling Queens, and is only two steps away from the 6 Pinling Kings, but he can't beat Aqi.
He is fast and ruthless with his seventy-two knives, and has a lightning-fast body, but he can't beat Aqi.
He claims to be a wild knife, and when he is mad, he is afraid of himself, but he can't beat Aqi!
When the people in the crowd saw the three waves wither, they were again a series of unscrupulous smiles.
"... "This time, the three waves of the wild knife can only depress a series of colons.
The crowd had been noisy for half a day, but they didn't see the newcomer make a noise, and they were a little confused.
"The new Taoist friend is silent? "asked the Beihe scattered person aloud.
Unfortunately, because of the effect of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has once again entered a half-sleep state.
At this time, Su Shi Aqi was very happy to send a message: "I read it, the new Dao friend called'Shushan pressure'. Have you ever heard of the master called this Dao number? This Dao number sounds like a Confucian practitioner?
In retrospect, the Confucian practitioners were even more enjoyable than the Buddhists, not only with their mouths, but also with their fists. When they were in the mood, they would also sing poems to help them have fun, which was very enjoyable!
"Seven, I said, your expectations for new Taoist friends are always only good to fight, and how good it is to fight? "San Dao said with a tearful expression.
"Eh. "Su Shi Aqi is a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren said with a bad laugh, "Would you be a'big senior' who can't use chat tools? "
When he said this, everyone felt that the scene was very visual?
Yes, almost four years ago, it seems that there was also a senior who left the customs after more than a hundred years of retreat, also had a hard time getting on the chat software, and was joined by Huang Shan Zhenjun, but because he couldn't type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy named Crazy Dao Sanlang was very happy to talk in front of the senior, and asked the senior to report three times, and asked her to send photos, and asked for voice chat and so on.
Then... a few days later, Shaan Dao Sanlang saw this senior with his own eyes. He was a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
Then, the beautiful elder tossed the three waves of the sword for a whole year and four months, and then left contentedly.
At this time, an ID called "pharmacist" spoke.
A short, inexplicable message with no end in sight.
Luckily, the people in the group were accustomed to the pharmacist's short chatting habit - he was asking the group owner where Huangshan Zhenjun was?
The brevity of the speech is not that the pharmacist is noble and arrogant, but because he uses two-finger zen and handwriting for typing, the speed of the thief is slow. When the number of words is too many, it is easy to make mistakes, and it is very painful to delete and write.
"After he added someone, he immediately went offline, and I heard that his precious big demon dog left home in a bad temper, and Huangshan Zhenjun went after him again. "
"The pharmacist. "
"Then I'll have to wait until the new Taoist learns to use the chat tool. "
They all have preconceived ideas and think that the newcomers are also in the same way.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang came to his senses.
"Remember someone joined me just now, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No. 1 group?" He muttered in a low voice, casually opened the chat tool in the lower right corner, pulling out the chat window of Jiuzhou No. 1 group.
What is it?
Soon, the chat record from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably went on a tour.
This seat? Pursue the big demon dog?
The special words in all kinds of fairy heroes.
The way the people in the group chatted and spoke was also very interesting - half-ancient, half-white. It gave the impression that modern people try to communicate in ancient language, but because the ancient text is not up to standard, the way of communication is very awkward.
"Whisper ~~" Song Shuhang laughs out loud.
It looks like this is a group built by fairy lovers?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of fairy fans!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a road number, and the place where they lived was called Dongfu, and the owner of the group described the lost pet dogs as the big demon dogs who had run away from home. Some people claimed that they hadn't beaten a Confucian traveler for hundreds of years, which means that they claimed to have lived for hundreds of years?
I feel a sense of shame just looking at these chat notes.
"This degree of obsession has reached the degree of the second disease, and it is a very Chinese characteristics of the fairy hero in the second. "Song Shuhang secretly nodding.
It looks like this is a concentration camp for patients with the second disease in the fairy chivalry!
This was his first impression of the Jiuzhou No. 1 Group and its members.
But why did you add him to the group?
He read the information of Huang Shan Zhenjun, the owner of the group, and was not his classmate, and he certainly did not know him.
The thin blue lines stretch smoothly from under the pen tip. The light blue lines on the palm-sized card are increasing, and gradually a complex and mysterious pattern becomes more and more perfect as the pen tip slides.
All of a sudden, the pen tip was heavy, and the lightness was changed, followed by a sharp side hook, the pen hook was like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly brightened, then quickly faded, and returned to normal.
His face is still focused when he finishes this card, and he has only completed 15 cards, which is ten cards short of today's task. What he is making is a one-star energy card, which is the lowest energy card, and it is one of the most widely used and most expensive cards at present.
Just then, the room suddenly went dark.
The number 100 was displayed on the meter. I didn't expect to run out of energy, and it seemed that I would have to add another task today. Chen Duoxun returned to his desk and threw himself into his work, relying on this paper-level card for all his resources.
Chen Duo's room is very small, only less than 40 square meters, and there is a half-old work table in it. Besides the work table is relatively clean, there are mountains of clutter everywhere in the room. The clutter is also all kinds of old books, piles of raw materials.
Chen Kuo has lived in this simple place for three years. This is a special relief house provided by the federal government, and a small room like this can be occupied for only 150 euros per month. For a poor person like Chen Kuo, there is really no cheaper place than here.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen finally finished the day's work - twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, counted them twice in a row, and made sure that the number was correct.
As soon as he entered the door, the shopkeeper noticed it and said, "A dusk is coming! "
He answered to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper, Uncle Hua, was an old man about fifty years old, and the years had left traces on his body that he could not hide. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of old glasses.
Chen Duo carefully took the card bag out of his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed it to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five. "
Uncle Hua took the card in Chen's hand and put it on the shelf without looking at it, smiling and saying, "Fortunately, you send the card every day, or I'll be in short supply here. "
Chen Duo smiled, but didn't answer, he knew that Uncle Hua's words were probably a joke. The One Star Energy Card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most expensive cards, not to mention that it is located near Dongwei University, where can only sell 25 energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Duo's temper, and did not talk nonsense, directly asked: "Does A Duo need cash or transfer? "
Chen Duo answered bluntly, and then handed a light green dika he had prepared to Uncle Hua. After the settlement, Chen Duo said goodbye to Uncle Hua and wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Duo and said, "A Duo wait a minute. "
Chen Duo stopped and turned to look at Uncle Hua with a little surprise: "Is there anything else? Uncle Hua. "
Uncle Hua took out a piece of yellow paper from the drawer and looked at Chen with a smile: "I almost forgot something. This is a card printing teacher training course certificate, which was attached to the dealer when the goods were purchased yesterday."
Looking at the kind-hearted face of Uncle Hua, Chen Kuo was moved. He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years, and if it hadn't been for him, Chen Kuo believed that life would be out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he just learned to make energy cards, and he sold them everywhere, but few people asked for them, and no merchants wanted to buy them. The amount of one-star energy cards required is very large, and merchants prefer to buy them in large quantities at a time.
Luckily, he met Uncle Hua, who agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price of each card was 103 euros, two euros lower than the lot price of energy cards on the market. Nevertheless, Chen Duo was very grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of 103 Odi was lower than the lot price of 105, Chen Duo felt himself surrounded by great joy. He sold all his energy cards and bought the cheapest food, and the rest of the money was spent on the raw materials for the energy cards.
Since then, Chen's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, and he didn't interrupt a day.
This was three years. In the past three years, he only made one card - a one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at ninety-five euros, each energy card he can earn eight euros, his daily income is stable at two hundred euros, which three years ago, he could not imagine the number.
When Chen Duo came back to his senses, he smiled at Uncle Hua and said, "Thank you, Uncle Hua!" He took the certificate and carefully put it into the card bag in his arms.
They often advertise with incomparable splendor, such as the lecture certificate saying "Dongwei University recognizes academic qualifications," "Dongwei University senior business card printing teacher authority to speak" Yun Yun, in fact, what is inside is clear. The only relationship between the organization hosting this training course and Dongwei University is that the institution will pay a fee to Dongwei University every time, as the cost of their maintenance of this nominal "joint organization."
Chen Duo still plans to listen to what is said in the training course. Business card printing is one of the most difficult learning, so many years, he has not given up self-study, but the effect is very little. Until last year, he did not understand what is going on.
For a teenager who has no foundation, it is even more difficult to learn business card printing, which is famous for its difficulty and obscurity. However, he has no doubt about his IQ, and can learn to make a one-star energy card in a week only by memory, the business card printing engineer once praised his talent.
Since then, he has let go of this goal, which was too high for him for the time being, and turned to basic theoretical studies.Every day, no matter how tired he was, he would take time to study these dull knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Kuo walked south along an alley. Today is Saturday, and he still has a job.
After walking across two streets for about twenty minutes, he came to a second-hand card buying station.
He is also the owner of this shopping station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Duo comes here to work for three hours.
Chen Duo gave a slight nod to Xiao Hei, but his face was still a little dull.
Xiao Hei has become accustomed to Chen Kuo's face. When Chen Kuo came here and asked for a short-term job, Xiao Hei refused. The buying station has been managed by his father since the beginning, and he has been managing it himself since then.
However, when Chen Duo said he didn't want to be paid, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Duo was still paid, and Chen Duo would usually choose a few old cards to take away as his salary.
Sometimes Chen Duo would pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste piles, and Xiao Hei calculated an account, and every month, he saved a lot of money on it. But for the taciturn Chen Duo, he was a little curious, how did this guy know that there was still energy left in these cards?
But since then, he has been smiling every time he sees Chen Duo.
Chen Duo squatted down and began to sort the old cards piled up. There were many kinds of cards, including energy cards, object cards, imitation cards, and even some rare plant cards and animal cards. But all the cards here were useless, and all Chen Duo had to do was to sort them into categories.
The work went on very quickly, and it was clear that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Duo turned his wrist and threw a card at Xiao Hei: "Here, this card can be used for a while." There is at least half of the energy in this two-star energy card, Chen Duo can't understand why the original owner of this card wasted so much. The capacity of the two-star energy card is 1,000, that is to say, there is almost 500 energy in it.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, and his eyebrows and eyes opened with a smile. He ran up to the energy meter and inserted the card. When he saw the "523" number on it, Xiao Hei's five senses were almost huddled with laughter.
After three years of production, he has his own understanding of the most common and lowest-level cards. There is not only one method of making one-star energy cards, Chen Kuo has collected twelve different structures of one-star energy cards from this.
These different one-star energy cards gave Chen a lot of inspiration, because he learned some of the skills of these cards, he successfully reduced the cost of making one-star energy cards to 95 euros. But such good luck does not happen every day, so far, he has only collected twelve.
But today's luck seems to be good.
Looking at the one-star energy card on his hand, judging from the texture on the surface, he is a one-star energy card that has never encountered another new structure.
He put the energy card aside and continued to immerse himself in rummaging through it. There were too many one-star energy cards, but Chen Duo never tired of checking them one by one. He was so fast that he could almost tell if he wanted it by touching the one-star energy cards with his hand.
All this came from his familiarity with the one-star energy card. This familiarity was left by three years of uninterrupted production, and he could judge whether the card was a one-star energy card, whether it was the structure he had seen, without looking at it. He was so familiar with them that he knew every detail of them.
The finger skimming over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Chu got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was drowsy as if it were not hers, the luxurious bed linen that the palm of her hand touched was not the old one she used to wash her hair, the lamp on top of her head was not the half-broken energy-saving lamp she was used to seeing, and her body was in pain as if she had just been torn by something, and she lifted her wrist, with a clear blue and purple mark on it.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to make herself shout, lifted the quilt, saw that there was no inch of herself inside, and screamed almost out of her voice.
Lin Chu's moving eyes turned twice under his eyes, resolutely lifted the quilt, got out of bed to clean up the messy clothes, put on casually, and if he didn't turn his head, he would run out.
"Ah... let go of me, you let go... "Lin Chu struggled with his hands and feet.
The man's big hand took her by the neck and dragged her back to the bed without any effort.
His deep eyes seemed to have an innate haughtiness on his cold cheeks, his pen nose was high on his white face, and his white jade-like skin made her feel envious and envious as a woman who asked herself if her skin was good.
She asked herself how many men she had seen, but the men who were called male gods suddenly faded in front of him.
Is this the man who spent half the night yesterday tossing her half to death?
"Who sent you, and you drugged me? You did such a thing, thinking you could leave here undamaged? "He looked at the stunned woman, his eyes flashing with anger.
This strange woman, whose skin is better than snow, has a pleasant little face, a pair of big, moving eyes, and flashing eyelashes, like a frightened deer, and she stares at him with her eyes wide open.
Gu Jingze's eyes were fixed on her body, and he saw Lin Chu's eyes turning quickly with his brain again.
But she was confused with the wrong person.
The person in front of him, although handsome and dizzy, is obviously not the super-first-line star Gu Jingyu.
This time, he took her arm again rudely, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled awkwardly in a circle before she settled down again.
"You're wrong, now I'm the one who's seriously damaged. "Her buttocks hurt, her hands hurt, and the pain underneath is even more people can't ignore, annoyed, she directly shouted out, "I'm fascinated by someone else, you don't have half a cent to do with you, you think you're worth my medicine, Aunt Ben didn't do it casually, you pay me back for the medicine money!"
Have you lost the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tense, his eyebrows were twisted into Sichuan characters, and his dark eyes were like dormant animals, staring at the woman in her cluttered clothes, her white half shoulders were exposed, and the bruises and red marks on them were clear and dazzling, and on the white and tender skin they seemed to be plum blossoms opening.
The images of the night flashed in his mind again, and his lower abdomen suddenly warmed, and he felt the obvious heat again, surging in his body.
He looked away from her face.
This damn woman dared to drug him, and the effect was so strong.
His moment of opening, so that Lin Chu finally got a chance, desperately jumped out of the bed, she pushed the man away.
She didn't dare to turn her head back, so she ran out.
When she heard him hiss, she shouted, "Look at what, look at yourself! "
"You... "Gu Jingze just turned to grab her, but felt the body was unbearable for a while, the following has been irresistibly high up again.
"Damn it. "He shouted and clenched his fists to restrain the damn **.
There was a series of sounds outside.
Qin Hao looked back and his mouth couldn't close.
What was it like? Why did a woman in untidy clothes come out of my husband's room?
He raised his sharp eyes, and his black eyes sparkled, so that Qin Hao quickly swallowed all the doubts he shouldn't have.
Gu Jingze washed his body in the bathroom until his skin was washed pink, and then he cursed in the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze was stunned, at this time, my mother even came over, thinking that it would not be a good thing.
When the bathroom door opened, a beautiful lady stood outside, looking in surprise at the mess on the bed.
The bunks that were too late to make up were clearly telling everyone in front of them what had happened last night.
Gu Jingze's dark eyes were gloomy, and he pulled his bathrobe over his honey-colored shoulders, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm busy today. "
How could Mu Wanqing not ask? The excitement on her face was hard to hide. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know that you have sex with a girl."
Gu Jingze pushed the door open and said to Mu Wanqing coldly, "Would you leave this matter alone? "
"How can I ignore it, Yasuzawa, you have to marry her, you have to take responsibility for other girls. "
"Mother, I won't marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name. "
"Mother! "Gu Jingze stood there, looking even more disturbed because he thought of the woman.
"Do you still think about that Mo Huiling? I tell you, you and her are impossible, you have been with her for so many years, still can't touch her, you are doomed not to be together at all! "Mu Wanqing said unkindly.
"Mother, that's enough! "Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, can not touch a woman at all, the family is almost ready for artificial insemination to let you get a child, but today you met a woman, it means that she is the most suitable for you! "
Taoist famous mountain Qingcheng, since ancient times, there are countless strange people and strange people in and out of it, the so-called grass reckless hidden dragon snake, just like this.
Countless myths and legends, countless legends, like a thick cloud, have covered Qingcheng with a layer of mystery.
At dawn, on the mountain slate path, groups of Tsing Yi Taoists, holding three long incense plants, silently and quickly marched on the path, towards a towering stone wall in the back hill, smooth as a mirror.
The mountain road is steep and the dew is slippery, but these people are faster than the running horses, bringing up strips of blue shadows. Some people jump up from time to time, flying across a distance of 100 meters in the wind, the morning wind blows, the clothes fly, the flowing, like a fairy.
In the mountains of Qingcheng Mountain, the peaks, and the great palaces and pavilions, there are Taoists constantly walking out and converging in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, a large group of little Taoists carried various flags, banners, and ritual instruments, and carried incense burners around the Nine Palaces. The cigarettes soared high in the sky, and the air of the tangled up, turning into a cloud covering the top of the road.
In front of the many Daoists, just below the stone wall, a group of Daoists dressed in gold-trimmed purple robes, with eight gossip drawings embroidered with silver thread on the chest and back, and the edges of the sleeves of the robes with cloudy lines and paraquat patterns, all around the body of the gorgeous Daoists, holding hands to brush the dust, standing there with no expression.
The road waited silently for a while, and when a red light in the east suddenly jumped up, and the red light tore the sky and the earth in all directions, many Taoists bowed down together and performed the three-kneeling and nine-knock salute to the stone wall.
Thousands of people recited the mantra at the same time, and the sound of the "humming humming" mantra became tangled together and spread out in a small sound that made people tremble. Gradually, a strange force rose from the sound of the mantra, and a bright seven-colored glow shot from the top of the heads of many Taoists, shining on the smooth and smooth stone wall.
The Taoists in gold-trimmed purple robes prostrated themselves on the ground and muttered a prayer.
If it lasted for half an hour, a wisp of white light finally came out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the whole stone wall was emitting a clear white light.
The haze rose into the sky, and there were countless clouds and smoke entangled in the stone wall, and a few dim figures with gold light on their bodies appeared in the clouds and smoke. The figures became clearer and clearer, and finally three men and two women dressed in white robes, their faces obscured by the gold light, appeared in front of the crowd.
The woman in the middle looked down at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had a pair of scrolls in her hand, which she threw out.
White light flashed on the stone wall, and the scroll made of purple jade woven of gold thread slowly floated out, landing on the hand of the old man in purple robes who was leading many Taoists to prostrate. The woman who threw the scroll said a few words in a murmur, turned around and left with a few companions.
Several old men in purple robes suddenly shouted, "Grandfather is merciful, merciful! "
The sound of "thumping" continued to sound, and all the Taoists kowtow to the five men and women, knocking their heads on the rocks.
The woman who threw out the scroll gave a cold shout, and all the Taoists knelt down stiffly and dared not make any more noise.
But the other woman beside the woman laughed a few times in a low voice, and threw a few things out of her backhand.
As the light of the stone wall dimmed, the five Taoists vanished without trace.
Several things sparkling with strange light slowly fell from the sky, namely a sword, a bead, a small ding, five charms and nine bottles of medicine.
Swords, beads, and small dings are as small as children's playthings, but each one is entangled with dazzling light and haze, and they are obviously extraordinary things.
The five Fuzhang Fuzhu is even more entangled with gold light, purple gas forcing people, if there is no pressure wave after wave from the Fuzhu, those who are close to the Taoist foothold is not stable, have been pushed back by this force.
The nine medicine bottles were densely engraved with various colored symbols and seals. The old man who had just taken the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists, and a secluded medicine box spouted out. Thousands of people in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, and felt that the seven knacks were smooth, and the meridians all over his body seemed to have been washed with clean water.
Just smelling the fragrance of the medicine surpassed the three months of painstaking work of these Taoists. The purple robes hurriedly stuffed the bottle tightly and sealed it solidly. The fragrance of Dan medicine alone has such magical effects, and you can imagine what a treasure the Dan medicine in this bottle is.
Several old men in purple robes gathered together and murmured for a while, picking up their swords, beads, ding, fuji, and medicine bottles, and then unfolded the scroll in front of all the people.
The first half of the scroll is a scripture for practicing qi and recuperating the spirits, "The Sutra of Taixi Qi," while the second half of the scroll makes the old men in purple robes pale and shout in panic. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists swarm out of the Qingcheng Mountains.
The potential power of the Qingcheng Mountains in the worldly world has been fully unleashed, setting off an invisible wave.
Part 1, Chapter 1
In the heat of July, Yau Bai Lu gave off a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, as if it were about to melt.
The road surface is directly distorted and skew because of the transpiration of the air.
Under such a poisonous day, there are few pedestrians on the streets, even cars are few, and everyone is looking for a cool place to escape the heat, or to enjoy themselves in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a washed-up white shirt and gray suit pants walked hurriedly, running straight to the Second People's Hospital.
The hair sticks tightly to the woman's face because of sweat, and the woman's cheeks are abnormally red, obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet with sweat, and it felt uncomfortable to stick to it, but Jonan didn't have time to pay attention to it, so he grasped the bag with the 100,000 yuan.
This was the money she managed to raise by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needed 200,000 for the operation, and she had to find another 100,000.
Walking straight to the ward, Jonan's hand touched the door guard and heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
"Mom, it was Jonan who killed me, and if it weren't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me. "This is the voice of Jonan's sister Qiao Ziyi.
"Don't cry, mother has taught you a lesson about Jonan. "Mother Ding Jiayi touches her eldest daughter's head with heartache.
Standing outside, Jonan felt that her sister was not caught cheating by Chen Jun, so Chen Jun would leave with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
When he thought of Chen Jun, Jonan's eyes were sad.
Chen Jun was originally Jonan's boyfriend, but Qiao Ziyi was pregnant with his sister's boyfriend's child, and Ding Jiayi scolded Jonan, saying that Jonan harboured evil intentions and was a heartless little brute who robbed his sister of her boyfriend and forced his sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had to quit and complete Chen Jun and his sister.
"Mom, Dajun and I are divorced, the child is not with me, I have this disease again, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't been filial to you, I really don't want to die. "
In the ward, Qiao Ziyi held Ding Jiayi in her arms and wept bitterly. She was so young and had a lot of good days, and she really didn't want to die.
Ding Jiayi was deeply moved to hear that her eldest daughter was so seriously ill and wanted to be filial to herself in the future.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Ziyi on the back: "No, Mom won't let you have anything to do. Mom has gone to raise money for you because of the dead girl Jonan. "
Not long after the divorce between Qiao Ziyi and Chen Jun, he suffered from kidney failure and had to have his kidney replaced immediately.
However, in this marriage, Qiao Ziyi's cheating was the wrong party, and Chen Jun worked for the government, so Qiao Ziyi was purged from his home, and now he is sick and has no money to see a doctor and take medicine.
When Jonan, who had known his mother's eccentricity for a long time, heard this conversation, his numb heart still ached.
She is 40 years old, and after she broke up with Chen Jun, she never fell in love again, not that she didn't want to talk, but her mother didn't want to talk.
Over the years, most of the money she earned was given to her mother, who used the money she earned to buy a 150-square-foot apartment for her sister, but she still had to live in a rental room with only a few dozen flats.
She pays for the food and even the water and electricity at her parents' house, and every time her sister comes back to her mother's house, although she carries some things in her hand, she carries more when she returns.
I'm not married at this age, and I'm joked that no one wants a leftover girl, Jonan doesn't know that her mother won't let her get married, just wants her salary.
But this is my mother, and every time I fall in love on a blind date, her mother will fight for her life, and she can't help it.
His hard work over the years, finally only in exchange for the three words "dead girl," especially Qiao Ziyi also put the responsibility of his own cheating divorce on his own body, Jonan grasped the 100,000 yuan in his hand, suddenly do not want to give Qiao Ziyi.
Before Jonan left, the next conversation Jonan heard was the one that really made Jonan feel cold and hopeless.
What if Jonan raises 200,000, but can't find **? In fact, the doctor said that if a relative is willing to donate a kidney to me, the matching degree will be higher, not prone to rejection. "
Leaning in Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Ziyi said pitifully, "If I really have a relative's *** I may be able to save a little money on medical treatment. "
** It's not so easy to find, some people can't wait for such an opportunity until they die!
Knowing this, Qiao Ziyi knew that if she wanted to live, it was not enough to have money, she had to think of other ways.
"Would you like my mother to have a blood test? "Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Ziyi kept shaking his head, her mother is this age, the kidney must not be much better than her, since they all want, she must be good: "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me, I don't want you to use the knife, my father is definitely not good. "
"Then... "Ding Jiayi thought, and her eyes lit up: "Wait a minute, the dead girl comes, I'll ask her to have a blood test, she's your sister, it's sure to fit!"
"Good is good, but Jonan will not agree, after all, this is a kidney. "Qiao Ziyi's eyes are full of the light of calculation.
In order to live, just in case, she would never let Jonan have the possibility of rejection.
"Miss Qiao, why don't you come to see your sister? "Qiao Ziyi and Ding Jiayi chatted together, and the nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Ziyi's face changed: "Mother... "Just now her conversation with her mother, was all heard by the dead girl [Jonan]?
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased out, saw Jonan's back, and shouted Jonan's name.
When Jonan heard Ding Jiayi's shout, he refused to turn back or stop, and his tears kept falling, but his heart was broken.
For her mother and her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister calculate that her money is not enough, and now they want her kidney.
Qiao Ziyi's words, Ding Jiayi did not understand, but Jonan understood, the more this, the more Jonan hated, even if she really owes the Qiao family should be enough!
When Jonan's head ached, she wanted to tell her mother that it was a danger on the street, and a car rushed towards her.
"Squeaking" and "banging," two loud noises exploded in his ears, and Jonan was speechless in pain, but he managed to open his eyes to see what was going on with her mother.
Ding Jiayi was really scared, and when she saw her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and muttered, "Jonan, it's good that you and you are dead, at least you can help your sister when you die.
The little girl was killed, and the person who hit the little girl must lose money.
When he heard Ding Jiayi's words, Jonan stared at Ding Jiayi, and before the rescuers arrived, he couldn't stay up and was angry with Ding Jiayi!
Part 1, Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that one moment you fantasize about heaven, and the next moment you find yourself in hell.
Two months ago, he was sitting in his classroom, imagining that he would be admitted to a key university in Xinyi, while he was working on a construction site in the hot sun.
Thinking of his miserable experience, he spit on the ground, raised his hand and wiped the sweat on his face. Just after moving a truckload of bricks, he was already wet with sweat.
Don't ask, a teenager of 17 or 18 years old, with an ordinary face, swarthy skin, thin body, and a pair of calm eyes. Maybe the children of the poor family have been in charge of the family, he looks a little young and mature.
I put the cement truck with the bricks in my hand on the roadside and sat down in a cool place. The foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy. In a dull and busy construction site, I was happy to be lazy.
He sat on a concrete slab, looking constantly at the road, and in a moment his eyes lit up; a beautiful figure came out across the road, which attracted his attention.
Although the distance is too far to see the other person's appearance, but the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look like just a woman walking, but there is a lot of learning inside. And don't ask to stay on the construction site all day long, opposite the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to remember something, and pulled out of his clothes on his chest a blue metal disc the size of a coin, tied by a small blue chain, like a strange necklace.
It was something he found accidentally when he was demolishing an old house a few days ago, when he found an old green brick in one of the walls, which was bumpy and broken, and was estimated to be a hundred years old.
If it's another hundred-year-old antique, I'm afraid it's worth a little money, but a green brick, even if it's an antique, it's probably worthless.
At that time, he threw the green brick on the ground, but he didn't want the green brick to break, and a metal ornament fell out of it, which was the strange necklace in his hand.
The blue metal disc was strange, divided into eight areas on the surface, and was carved with strange runes.
Mo Qian is not familiar with antiques, but he can see that the thing in his hand should be a miniature version of the gossip plate, ordinary people will hang the gossip plate at home to seek good fortune and avoid evil, as a ritual instrument to offer.
Although he is not superstitious and does not believe that the gossip plate can have any ability to avoid evil, but he also knows that this ancient gossip plate should be worth a lot, maybe it is an antique, if sold to antique dealers, it is likely to become rich overnight.
Don't ask if your eyes are full of longing, touching the gossip necklace is like touching his lover. Once you become rich, those beautiful women who only dared to peek from a distance, swallowing secretly, are not for him to pick.
"There's an accident. There's an accident!"
"There's an accident! Call an ambulance. "
A noisy shouting sounded from a distance, followed by a number of people running to the place, and the shouting interrupted the dream.
He looked there in disbelief, hesitated, but stood up and ran to the place where the crowd had gathered.
A middle-aged man in rags, nearly fifty years old, lay on the ground convulsing, pale, breathing heavily, and covering his chest with his hands tightly, as if in pain.
His eyes were filled with deep fear, and he seemed to feel death.
Many co-workers arrived, but no one dared to come forward, and a group of uneducated workers obviously didn't know what was happening and didn't dare to take action.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Don't ask, his face changed slightly, and he looked at Lao Zhang convulsing on the ground a little ugly. He recognized Lao Zhang's symptoms at a glance, because there was a sudden acute myocardial infarction in the village, and he died in just a few minutes, he witnessed the whole process.
The village where he lives is very remote, there is basically no professional doctor in the village, usually have a disease is a simple treatment with the earthworks handed down from the ancestors, there is no targeted treatment.
His mother was sickly and tired, and there was no doctor in the village, so his biggest dream was to enter the most famous medical university in China and become a doctor to treat his mother and the villagers.
Unfortunately, he failed the college entrance examination, and with his score, he could have been admitted to the Medical Department of Huaxia University and could have obtained the qualification for free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son-in-law, whose score was lower than his, but he was pushed down.
Although he could be admitted to other good schools with his grades, the high tuition fees were too high for him to pay, so in order not to burden his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The construction site is a development area on the edge of the city, far from the city, and it takes 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at the nearest hospital. Depending on the patient's appearance, can you insist on 25 minutes or two things? 25 minutes? That's a miracle!
This person he knows, and he lives in the same shed with him, named Zhang Honest, usually everyone calls him Lao Zhang, an honest and honest person, because he has no skills, can only do the lowest level of small work on the construction site like him.
It is said that he also has a son who is in college, and he works so hard to earn money in order to support his son's college education.
Don't ask a little hesitantly looking at the workmate Lao Zhang on the ground, his dream is to become a doctor, have a certain understanding of some simple and common pathology, for acute myocardial infarction, but know that there are several first aid measures can relieve the condition.
But these days, who dares to save people at will? It's a good thing to be able to save people well, but if you can't save people, the patient has three strengths and two weaknesses, and the responsibility will be attached to him.
However, such is the reality of society, perhaps simply take some emergency measures to relieve the disease, prolong the time of death, can save a life. But I don't ask, like other people around me, dare not rush to help.
After taking a deep breath, he was silent for a while, and finally sighed and walked towards Lao Zhang, who was suffering from the disease. He was not a good man, but Lao Zhang and he had a good relationship. They were all poor rural people who came out to work and deeply understood each other's difficulties. Lao Zhang was the backbone of the whole family, and watching Lao Zhang die, his conscience couldn't do it.
"Don't touch him, I'm a doctor."
A beautiful figure came from a distance, running all the way through the cluttered construction site, trotting to the site of the accident.
Don't ask a little stunned, subconsciously stopped his steps, a fragrance of wind hit, in front of him there was a beautiful figure.
It was a girl with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Qian, wearing a beige dress with flowers, the hem of which fell at the bend of the legs, revealing a pair of slender white calves.
He squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but it was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl! A beautiful natural carved beauty reverberated in his mind!
He found out that the girl in the white skirt was the one across the road who had secretly cheated on someone else's body. Now he knew that she was not only in good shape, but also had a surprisingly beautiful face.
The girl didn't pay attention to the question, directly squat down to check Lao Zhang's condition, soon the beautiful face changed, it seems that the situation is a bit serious.
Don't ask, I also know that at this time the patient appeared shock, the situation is not optimistic.
"Could you help me?"
The girl looked up anxiously and asked Mo, at this time Mo asked the nearest to the patient, naturally the first time to find him.
"I can do it!"
Mo asked a little stunned, did not expect the girl would ask him for help, but quickly reacted to it, hurried to the girl's side.
"Can you help me flatten his body and lift his legs slightly? "the girl asked Mo as she carefully performed the external chest compression surgery for Lao Zhang.
He knew that there were some methods to relieve myocardial infarction, and he quickly followed the girl's instructions. He knew that the method was correct, and that lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the lack of oxygen in the brain of the shocked patient, and this was the best solution when there was no oxygen tank or other equipment.
He suddenly found that his chest was hot and getting hotter, as if there was a red-hot iron block sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest and found that it was the gossip dish that had been unearthed from the old blue brick.
Anlin stood at the top of the tall building, facing the noisy wind.
The wind howled, the sense of weightlessness that fell sharply, and even though he was loveless, he was scared and screamed. "Help!! "
The fear of impending death hung over his whole body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, Anlin's whole body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light cluster.
The horrible feeling of overweight also came at this moment, and he felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushing to the end, then going around an arc, and flying into the sky.
Anlin's screaming continued, and his body flew into the sky and landed on the roof again.
The intense overweight and weightlessness, and the feeling of alternating between life and death, made Anlin feel dizzy in the head, and then vomited indisputably.
"Hello, boy, are you better? "Just then, an ethereal voice reached Anlin's ear.
He looked up and found an old man looking at him with a loving face.
The old man's hair is white, the wind is fairy, the whole body is haunted by gold and fairy, and he looks holy and flawless.
Seeing this scene, Anlin's whole body was shocked, and countless plots came to my mind.
All kinds of plots began to come to Anlin's mind, and the beginning of all the dreams was this scene!
Puff!
Anlin kowtows heavily and says with tears in his eyes, "Fairy, thank you for saving me! "
The old man, who was called a fairy by Anlin, caressed his white beard and smiled and said, "You are in a good age, why should you choose to live lightly? "
"My mother died young, and my father was a gambler. ""After he gambled away the house, he ran up millions of dollars in gambling debt and couldn't pay it back, and then he ran away alone!"
"Millions of dollars! What can I give back?"
"After that, I was forced to drop out of school and work as a drudge for the moneylender. "
Anlin poured out his snot and tears, only to feel that life was gloomy. What's the difference between a life of repaying debts and a salty fish?
After listening to Anlin's experience, the fairy also had a sympathetic look in his eyes, he slowly said: "Boy, your life is really hard... So, you and I meet is predestined, and I think you have excellent qualifications, why not let Ben Xian send you a set of'system', let you change your life. "
When Anlin heard the words, he shuddered all over. He thought it was fortunate to have a fairy relationship with the fairy, but he didn't expect the fairy to be so generous, and he would send the system as soon as they met!
"Wow-wow, fairy grandpa, you are so kind to me! I really don't know, how to repay you! "
The cactus smiled kindly, and the palm of his hand turned to the sky, followed by a pure white photosphere, which appeared in the palm of his hand.
"Boy, come over and hold this photosphere in your hand, "said the fairy to Anlin.
When he heard this, Anlin was excited and couldn't wait to hold the photosphere.
The photosphere in his hand gave off a trace of warmth, and the light in the ball was extremely soft.
"Initiate the system transfer. "The fairy said slowly.
The fairy's words just fell, the light on the white photosphere is brilliant!
At this moment, the fairy said to Anlin, "Boy, you swear to accept this God of War system, and never leave it! "
The God of War system?
What a domineering name!
But how is this vow like a marriage declaration?
Without time to think about it, Anlin hastened to say, "I swear to accept the God of War system and never leave it! "
As soon as Anlin's vows were finished, the photosphere swooped directly into his body and melted into him.
Then, a voice sounded in his mind: "The test host is the physique of the underworld, meet the qualifications, the system began to merge! "
Anlin was so excited that he wanted to cry.
Originally I thought my life was gloomy, but I didn't expect to turn around, even at this moment ushered in the life of the open system!
The fairy was also very excited, and was so excited that he was already crying!
"Grandfather, what's wrong with you, are you okay? "Seeing the old man's strange behavior, Anlin asked curiously.
The fairy came back to his senses and wiped his tears, knowing that he had lost his temper.
"Boy, after you get the system, you have to cheer up. "The fairy said earnestly.
"Hmm! I will! "Anlin nods his head heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school to cultivate the fairy? "the fairy then asked.
Go to school to cultivate immortals? Only a fool would refuse!
"I think so, I really want to repair the fairy!"
Anlin almost didn't think about it, so he answered. The fairy smiled, took out a piece of golden paper and handed it to Anlin, and said, "This is my letter of recommendation, and with it, you can go to Xiuxian United University to study and officially embark on the road of Xiuxian."
An Linxin was startled, dare this dragon proud of the road to repair the fairy, the fairy people have paved for themselves!
He solemnly accepted the letter of recommendation from the fairy and looked at the fairy with a thankful face.
Anlin was very curious about the fairy who had given him new life.
"The name... I don't want to say it. "The fairy caressed the top of Anlin's head with a sympathetic look on his face.
"I've got to go, I'll see you. "
The fairy said goodbye to Anlin, and then went away through the clouds.
"The fairy, you walk slowly! "Anlin said thankfully to the fairy flying into the sky.
The sky heard the laughter of the fairy, the laughter was incomparably cheerful, incomparably wanton, as if pouring out the anger of a lifetime.
Why is this fairy so happy? How can he feel happier than me?
Anlin's face was confused.
Just then, a female voice sounded in Anlin's consciousness, "Hello. "
The girl's voice was beautiful, like the sound of nature, and Anlin was smart all over.
Is this the sound of the system?
Anlin was unsure.
At this point, an interface appeared in Anlin's mind.
The interface is gray, with only a few words displayed on it: The functions of the God of War system will be activated after entering the Taichu Continent.
What the hell is the Taichu mainland?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation from the fairy, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Then he found that there was nothing in the gold paper, only a slightly concave handprint.
Anlin didn't know why, but he put his hand on the paper and coincided with the handprint.
All of a sudden, the golden light of the paper was so bright that Anlin only had time to say a "huh" in surprise, and was completely swallowed up by the golden light.
Anlin only felt a whirl of the sky, and his vision changed from dark to bright again.
Then he found that his body appeared high in the sky again and began to land freely.
Anlin experienced the feeling of jumping from the building again, and no matter how many times he came, he wanted to shed tears.
Anlin looked up with some difficulty and saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two white-patterned gantry columns, up to a hundred feet high, stand between the skyline, and the plaque is engraved with mysterious characters that he does not understand.
Behind the gate, there are thousands of palaces with no end in sight.
Clouds float around the palace, and all kinds of spirit animals soar between the sky and the earth, a grand and magnificent fairy weather.
An Lin stood where he was, with a shocked look on his face.
Originally, this world really has a fairyland!
Anlin tried to calm down and calm himself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a robe coming up and hurried up to say hello.
"Hello, fairy sister. "Anlin waved to the woman.
When the beautiful woman saw Anlin waving to her, she came over.
Anlin was a little excited and asked, "This beautiful fairy sister, what is this place? I'm new here, and I don't know much about this place. "
When she heard Anlin's words, the woman looked a little strange and said, "Gibber? "
"Ah, what do you say?"
The woman showed the same expression as Anlin and said, "Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle? "
Anlin was blindfolded at this moment, and a terrible conjecture came to his mind.
"Fairy sister, can you speak Mandarin? "Anlin's eyes are a little moist.
"Gurl, gurgle, wow, chirp? "The beautiful woman put her hands on her waist, a little angry.
That's it. I don't understand the language.
What the hell is she saying? I can't understand it at all!
Nani? Finally, Anlin wept.
"Shout!"
"Shout!"
"Shout!"
On one platform, hundreds of people gathered around, screaming and cheering, and dozens of cars, most of them supercars, surrounded the crowd.
The most noticeable place is the two cars that are about to run.
One is the most expensive red Ferrari 488, worth more than four million, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth half a million, the two cars together form a sharp contrast.
This is a duel between Liu Feng, a new young man in Shanghai, and one of the first four young Hans.
At the side of the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han silently leans against the door of the car, his clothes are sloppy, his hair is very long, when he bows his head, bangs cover his eyes, people can not see his closed eyes, from the lower part of his face, can also dimly see the unique handsomeness of Zhang Dashao, but now the temperament has become full of decadence.
Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, looked like the stars holding the moon, and his expression seemed to say that the world was under his feet.
"Let's go and see Zhang Dasiao who once stood tall. "
Liu Feng waved his hand, hung up a sneer at the corner of his mouth and led the way.
"Is it okay?"
"Are you asleep? Zhang Daxiao, who used to be a great man, is now down like this, tut, before the start of the game, what's cold, my Zhang Daxiao! "
"The way he is now, I think he is a poor beggar!"
"No, I don't think he's even as good as a beggar, maybe he lives on pig food. "
On the side of the Ford Mustang, a fat man with glasses stood with a three- or four-year-old girl on his lap.
The little girl is long and carved in pink, wearing a white dress, the delicate little face is like a lovely princess in a fairy tale, except for the hair is a little messy, all the other is perfect, but at this time the little girl's big clear eyes contain tears of aggrieved, listening to the people's criticism of Zhang Han, she seems to be about to cry.
In normal times, it is estimated that the cute look of the little girl will attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng's performance time alone.
A burst of sarcasm and insults finally made Zhang Han have a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a dazed look in his eyes, and when he saw the behavior of the people in front of him, his eyes were full of a sense of disdain for the world.
"Do the ants dare to bark in front of the Buddha-figure?"
Zhang Han's mouth suddenly burst out such an inexplicable word.
The whole audience was silent, but the next moment, there was a sarcasm of laughter.
"Zhang Han, I think you are crazy?"
"I'm afraid I haven't become a fool."
The crowd jeered again, but Zhang Han was stunned when he saw the picture clearly.
"Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng in 2009? "
"How can I be here?"
"Am I not crossing the sky?"
"Am I back? "
"I was reborn by the cataclysmic thunder of the nine skyscrapers? "Zhang Han's eyes flashed a tremor.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight families in Beijing, Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Han was not afraid, but when the family was on a plane trip, a plane crash occurred on the way, his parents and sister were killed, the second uncle Zhang Ming was the head of the family, but did not prevent the loneliness of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was devastated at the time, believing that his family had been killed, and began to investigate Zhang Ming, who had always been hostile to his father, but was discovered by him, and Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was eventually expelled from the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, Zhang Han refused to leave, always wanted to find out the matter, the days are very difficult, but always insisted, until the wolf walking incident.
I remember that when I was racing in this wolf mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident, lost my arms, and finally jumped off a cliff for five years, but I didn't expect to accidentally enter the world of Xiuzhen. When I started contacting Xiuzhen, Zhang Han realized that he had the gift of smelling treasures, and his nose could smell treasures within a certain range.
With this magical power, in five hundred years, Zhang Han used all kinds of treasures to accumulate cultivation to the extreme,
"Why wasn't it five years ago?"
Zhang Han's expression raised a trace of loneliness.
Not doing filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart, before his relatives left, he was young and frivolous and ignorant, caused a lot of trouble to his father, and said a lot of sad words to his mother, all of which no matter how much regret can not be made up.
Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the beginning, his love for his parents from the bottom of his heart was no less than that of others.
Trees want to be quiet but the wind never stops, children want to nourish but not to wait.
"Zhang Han!"
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he saw Liu Feng looking at himself coldly.
"Five years ago, you drove me out of the capital city!
Today, five years later, my Los Angeles car king Liu Feng is back, but you Zhang Han is not as good as a dog! Remember, today my Liu Summit let you Zhang Han out of the capital city! "
"Oh, it's so great? "Zhang Han refused with a surprise: "Then I can't compare."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the keys of the Ferrari in his hand and said, "As long as you beat me, this car is yours. ""Then I'll be overwhelmed. "
Zhang Han said with a smile.
"Ah. "
Liu Feng gave a sneer and raised his hand to tell everyone, "Put up the screen! "
After the speech, several TV screens were set up behind the crowd, and at the same time, remote-controlled aircraft were raised all over the Wolf Walking Mountain, and the screens were turned on, and the footage from the remote-controlled aircraft was transmitted back one by one, reflecting the whole track of Wolf Walking Mountain.
"Get ready to start!"
Liu Feng sat in the Ferrari, nodding to the fat man with glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang.
"Daddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys
"How can a cute little girl call her father?"
Zhang Han shook his head with laughter.
"Han Ge, you can win!"
The fat man clenched his fist at Zhang Han and made a look of encouragement.
"By your kind words, your car will bring me good luck."
Zhang Han looked at him indifferently and sat sideways in the Mustang.
"Get ready!"
The engines of both cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng's mouth hangs a wisp of a proud smile.
The fat man at the back let out a meaningful smile.
The eyes of the lovely princess at his feet were full of fear and worry, and her eyes were full of tears.
Zhang Han in the Mustang had a sneer on the corner of his mouth.
"Are you trying to harm me?"
"Unfortunately, I'm not who I was. ""Even if I don't have any cultivation now, can I be provoked by the ants? "
Chapter 1
Rust Lake.
Federal No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site.
It is also known as the "Magic Treasure Grave."
With the continuous development of the civilization of cultivating the truth, the magic treasures that once stood high and could only be driven by cultivators have entered thousands of households, becoming essential tools for ordinary people to travel at home, study and work.
While bringing convenience to life, it also generates a lot of waste magic treasures and metal garbage.
Most of these garbage magic treasures leave a lot of psychic power, easy to cause radiation pollution, the construction of the magic treasure is extremely unstable, and even have the risk of explosion, if left unattended, will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, a number of "special garbage disposal sites" will be set up to deal with waste magic treasures.
The No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site is located in the southern suburb of "Fuge City," a major cultivation town in the Federation.
Under the dusky yellow sky, a polluted purple swamp, emitting a strong stench, the mountain peaks composed of metal fragments like hundreds of dinosaurs out of the swamp, the mountain peaks are full of fragmented flying swords, sitting next to the flying sword rusty hedron puppets, the hollow eye sockets have already extinguished the spiritual fire, only the psychic worms to eat the head from the inside, carefully looking at the dangerous "Magic Treasure Cemetery."
"Boom! "
Countless metal components scattered and splashed, triggering the collapse of several surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust, like a demon dancing, covering the whole sky.
It seems to be a no-go area for life, and only insignificant cockroaches and worms regard it as a paradise.
Li Yao lay dormant behind a mountain of garbage, licking his dry and cracked lips, and his khaki windbreaker was covered with dust, making him one with the environment.
Glancing at the rising explosion cloud not far away, the teenager's clear eyes did not show any emotion, and the waves were not happy.
It was only when mud and metal fragments splashed into the mountain of garbage where he was hiding that he shrunk slightly deeper into the pile and put on goggles large enough to cover half of his face.
"I'm here!"
At 3:52:38 p.m., the daily routine garbage dump time is also Li Yao's "garbage bug" revelry time!
The Lingzi watch on his left wrist is a special hunting model launched by the cultivator "Flying Ling Zong" three years ago, and it took him two months to repair it after he found it in a garbage mountain.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function that can record vibrations of a special frequency and notify the owner when a specific vibration is heard nearby.
This function was originally used to warn hunters of the possible presence of powerful monsters in the vicinity.
After Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage boat was about to appear.
Moments later, with an insignificant hum, a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust that covered the sky from the explosion had not yet dissipated, and a dozen small black spots were mixed among them, making it impossible to distinguish them clearly.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose, and his fingers touched a rune on the side of the goggles, "Sh," making the surface of the goggles red.
Scanned by the red light, the garbage boat hidden behind the smoke and dust was pictured with a round figure, clear and clear.
The hunting function of the Lingzi watch also firmly locks the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"The garbage ship 1327, it's you!"
From birth to the age of ten, Li Yao stayed at the Fabao Tomb for ten years, knowing every garbage boat in every inch of the land and sky here, the "1327 garbage boat" is responsible for collecting garbage in the "Upper East Side" of Fongo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and affluent area in the city, where many cultivators live, and the magic treasures they throw away are the most valuable.
Many of the magical treasures are even intact, just because they are a little old, or because a new generation of products has been launched, they have been discarded by the realists and the rich indifferent.
For Li Yao, what is this garbage ship? It's a treasure ship full of gold mines!
"Zap! "
Li Yao's two feet, like projectiles, rushed between the garbage mountains, rushed to the dust, rushed to the "1327 garbage ship"!
Surrounded by crumbling garbage mountains and bubbling poisonous swamps at the foot, Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountain forest, borrowing power from time to time in a prominent part of the garbage mountain, each pedal can bounce tens of meters away, the movement of the clouds and flowing water, pleasing to the eyes.
"Li Yao, you bastard, and the old man to grab food!"
At this moment, a dozen figures emerged from behind several garbage mountains, dressed similarly to Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood-red goggles and Lingzi watch.
These men were menacing with shovels and iron bars in their hands.
Like Li Yao, they were garbage bugs who ate from the "No. 23 Special Garbage Disposal Site."
Where there are interests, there are struggles, and the boatloads of abandoned Dharma treasures may be just garbage for the high-level cultivators, but for these poor people at the bottom, they are the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best litterbug in the tomb of Dharma treasure, and naturally is also the eyesore of most of the litterbugs, a thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao didn't care, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
"Failong, everyone comes out to eat, who is faster than, you should lose weight! "
The fat teenager had a huge red mark on his face, and his nose was sinking into fat, so he shouted with anger that he ordered his men to chase him, and the party quickly entered the smoke area.
There has just been an explosion here, it is very unstable, dozens of garbage mountains will collapse at any time, even the vicious Fat Dragon gang of teenagers can not help but slow down to enter this place, watching Li Yao speeding.
The fat dragon spat.
After the speech, a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao exploded again, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic treasures rushed down like a flash flood!
"It's so smart!"
But I heard a scream from the smoke: "Little Black, help! "
A black awn, deeper than the night sky, shot out, "dropped" in a circle in the metal torrent, and then rushed into the air, but it was a rusty, notched blade, black flying sword, the flying sword has a huge guard like black wings, Li Yao is like a drowning man grasping the straw, very awkwardly lying on the flying sword, wrapped around the black awn, rushing to the sky!
In the sky, a dozen garbage boats have revealed a huge figure, each garbage boat is hundreds of meters long, the round figure is like the legendary tortoise supporting the earth, the "tortoise shell" is densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, flashing light, colorful, to help these tens of thousands of tons of giants to resist the invasion of gravity.
"Wow! "
The hatch of the abdomen of a "big tortoise" opened, and a flood of metal components and broken magic treasures crashed into the ground.
For a moment, the spiritual power of the whole world was stirring wildly, setting off a stormy wave!
Even the garbage boat, which weighed tens of thousands of tons, rocked left and right in the psychic wave, and had to be separated desperately to reduce the disturbance.
Feilong and others are even more afraid to approach easily, for fear of being affected.
Li Yao was still riding his black flying sword to rush left and right in the wave of psychic power, looking awkward to the extreme, but as flexible as a loach.
Of course, he dared not face the stormy waves, but with more than ten years of survival experience, he tried to find a relatively calm safe area between the spiritual tides, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic treasure, near the water tower first.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage boat roared like a monster, turned around, and sailed languidly back, gradually dissipating the smoke.
Feilong had a hard time climbing into the garbage dump center and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand-new garbage hill, looking at him with a smile.
"Damn it!"
The fat dragon's face was trembling, but his heart was tangled.
The garbage mountain that Li Yao chose is quite ingenious, it is not the largest garbage mountain, and it does not look like the one with the most abundant materials.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, which contain valuable garbage magic treasures.
If you continue to entangle with Li Yao here, you may be profited by other garbage bugs.
Other litterbugs have appeared looming around, and there were cheers on many garbage hills, where someone found something of value.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, a stinky boy, was also a student of the famous "Red Xiaopai Affiliated Second High School" in Fuge City.
The Red Xiao faction is a well-known big sect in the south of the Federation, with strong strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any real story, he is not able to deal with it with three fists and two feet, otherwise he would not have been single-handedly in the tomb of Fabao for more than ten years, still jumping around, and also fought out the nickname "vulture"!
But when he left, where did he put his face?
His nose was still embedded in the flesh! His heart was tangled, a strong wind passed by, the fat dragon subconsciously reached out to copy, the hand was cold, but it was a fist-sized waste crystal brain.
Li Yao said with a smile: "Failong, everyone came out to beg for a living, but last time I robbed you of a "starlight" crystal brain, and didn't kill your father, as for such a non-stop? Here, I just found a "Blue Dragon Gate" refined "Snap Dragon 17" crystal brain, is the most advanced model, can calculate more than 5,000 ideas per second, although burned out, I estimate that I can sell three or four thousand yuan, as if I respect your fat dragon brother, from now on we are even, how about? "
"You... "Failong didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this, and was stunned, scratching the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the'Wild Wolf Gang' is about to arrive, they are not like me as a lone traveler, they will definitely eat and wipe away dozens of garbage mountains, not even a screw will be left for you!" Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, sweep the goods quickly!"
A group of litterbugs scattered and rushed to the mountain of garbage in all directions.
Li Yao breathed a long sigh of relief, sat down in the garbage dump, his brow rolled down beads of sweat, and a smiling face suddenly began to cry.
"Dead fat man, I found the'Snapper' crystal brain hard, cheap you in vain! "
"Wait a minute, are my "Vulture Lee Yao" things so easy to hold?
One day, I want you to eat my food and spit it out for me, take my food and give it back to me, plus interest, according to usury, let you know why everyone calls me "the money-hungry vulture"! "
"No, we must speed up, the'Wild Wolves' gang of bastards, but they are more unreasonable than the fat dragon! "
"Mom, I've told you many times, I'm going to save people, not to commit suicide!"
"Don't lie to Mom, you can't even dig a dog, and save people? Besides, there's no one in the river! "
Wang Yao was speechless. Today, when he came down from the mountain, he saw someone falling into the river near the village, and he jumped down to save people. After he jumped down, he remembered that he didn't know how to water at all, and the irony was that the person who fell into the water was not a person, but an inflatable doll, which was very realistic.
"Is there anyone in the village who uses this thing so fashionable?! "
This was his last thought before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again, he lay on his own kang, next to his parents, frowning.
Within a day, the whole village knew that the silly college student who contracted the mountain and planted herbs couldn't get rid of it and committed suicide by jumping into the river. "Children today, they haven't experienced setbacks, they can't bear the blow! "
"Eighty percent of the children went to school, how can a famous college student go home to farm the land? "
"It is!"
"I won't plant this medicine!"
The father who had been squatting on the side of the smoking bag angrily popped out this sentence, the villagers good face, this rumor, the old Wang listened to the heart of the panic, and then planted, lost some money is nothing, maybe even the son also lost in it.
"That is, this time, listen to my mother, don't grow herbs, go to the city another day to ask your sister to help find a decent job, your Uncle Changmao's child just graduated from an unknown school, found a job in the city, now all buy a house there!" Wang Yao's mother also said to the side.
After hearing this, Wang Yao stopped raising the bar with his parents, so he had to nod his head and accept it.
He was a student who graduated from a famous university, but after graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm, started his own business, contracted a barren mountain in the village, wanted to grow herbs, and become rich. As a result, when he really started to work, he found that the cultivation of herbs is far from as simple as he imagined, full of enthusiasm is not enough, and many things are not in books, can only rely on practice and experience,
In the first year, the herbs he planted suffered from worm disease and lost their blood; in the second year, the herbs blossomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots; this was the third year, and it looked a little better.
But after he felt more comfortable, he went to Nanshan, which is a barren mountain, probably because of the soil quality, not very long crops, but there are a dozen big chestnut trees, jujube trees, there is a large gentle slope on the mountain, there are several mu of medicine fields that he laboriously cultivated, so he also spent money to build a hut on the mountain, connected with electricity, specially take care of these mu of medicine fields, wind and rain, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he poured three years of hard work, said to give up, he really can't give up.
Looking at the herbs that were growing well, he reached out and felt them.
Don't try it for a year?
"Detect the herb, the trigger conditions are met, is it activated?"
A cold mechanical sound suddenly rang.
"What is it, who?! "
All around, there are mountains, water and trees, but there is no one.
"Hiss, is it a hallucination?"
"Do you want to activate the system?"
The sound of the arms sounded again, and it seemed to be just around the corner.
"There's a ghost!"
Wang Yao was full of a spirit.
The pharmacist system?
As soon as he said these words, a curtain of light appeared in front of him, like a figure panel in the middle of Wang's worries.
An hallucination. It must be an hallucination.
He shook his head vigorously, and the curtain of light that had appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Just then, a terrier rushed down from the mountain and came to him, spitting his tongue and wagging his tail, looking very happy.
"San Xian, where did you go?"
This is Wang Yao's terrier, who has been with him on the mountain for three years. When the dog entered the hut on the mountain, Wang Yao went to bed and felt dizzy.
"What was that thing?"
He said the name of the unit on one side, and the light curtain reappeared as if it were a projection.
"I'm here again!"
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but a real thing that could not be explained by science. There are characters, skills, and packages, just like an online game.
Job level: rookie (in fact, you are not even a bird, at most an egg!
Physique 1, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average level of normal adult men).
Is it true? He's completely covered up.
That's great, he's growing herbs now, and that's what's missing! Wang Yao, who came back to his senses, jumped up excitedly, startling the "three fresh" on the side.
Is there also a skill panel? Wang Yao wants to point but doesn't look at it.
"Why can't I open it?" he asked subconsciously.
"The herbs are not good, I want to do something else, shovel the shit! "
It seemed to hear his question, and a line of words popped up on the panel.
Damn it, what's the situation? Who designed it, come out, and I promise not to kill you! "What is this? "
Wang Ano clicked in the package column and found a sign like a canteen.
An ancient spring pot with ancient spring water in it, one barrel a day.
How do I use it? Do you reach out and take it?
Wang Yao thought, and there was one more thing in his hand, it was a wooden jug, antique, held in his hand, quite a bit of weight, a gentle shake, there was water crunching inside.
"Is there water! Old spring water?"
He found a bucket in the room and poured out the water in the kettle, a small pot, but the water kept coming out until the whole bucket was filled.
Is it amazing?
Wang Yao stared at the water in the bucket, very clean and pure, reached out and took a mouthful into his mouth, very sweet.
It's delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. He drank three large bowls before he stopped. After drinking the water, he felt much more comfortable and his tiredness was relieved.
Wang Wang Wang, the three fresh on the side of the circle around the bucket.
"Come on, you'll have something to drink."
Wang Yao also put a bowl in the basin where he drank water, and the terrier quickly drank it up, and then barked and wagged his tail, obviously not drinking enough.
"Okay, I'll let you drink enough!"
The man and the dog drank half a pail, and if they hadn't panicked, they would have drunk the pail of water.
Wang Yao has never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1 I want to lose weight!
On a hot summer day, the Pond Cloud Rainforest in the eastern part of the Federation is full of clouds and mist, surrounded by a layer of gauze, a towering ancient tree, crisscrossing the luxuriant canopy, sometimes a few birds rise in the sky, hissing and soaring in the sky.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist forever, is no longer what people remember, but many years ago, it was directly pierced by a huge indescribable bronze sword, exposing a small half of the point of the sword!
This ancient sword seems to have experienced thousands of years, coming from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes, and has a strong pressure, forming a halo, enveloping the sky, as if it can suppress the earth, let all beings worship!
From a distance, the scene of the Jianyang Rainforest looks like a picture scroll, until it is broken by a hum in the distance. A large red hot air balloon boat is slowly flying above the rainforest.
The cabin of the hot-air balloon was large enough to hold hundreds of people, and many young men and women could be seen in groups on the deck, sometimes with laughter.
They are students from Phoenix, who were admitted to one of the four major colleges of the Federation, the Ethereal Dao Academy, and are taking this airship belonging to the Ethereal Dao Academy, crossing thousands of miles to study at the Ethereal Dao Academy.
Perhaps it is the anticipation of schooling, the journey for these young men and women is not dull, there is a more hazy attraction between men and women, making the journey of thousands of miles, not some fun.
Because of the long distance, the airship is equipped with a restaurant, spiritual room, infirmary and other areas.
At the moment, there were a lot of students in the airship's restaurant, and at one of the dining tables, there was a little fat man with a straight belly.
The fat little man was about seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in a big blue robe, and with a round little face that was barely beautiful, he was slapping his stomach and making a cracking sound as he looked at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him with regret.
"This meal will gain three pounds, why didn't I bear it? I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young. "
The little fat man was sad and remorseful, and he belched. The little fat man was named Wang Baole, who was also admitted to the Ethereal Taoist College this time. His lifelong dream was to be an official, and he took becoming the president of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit, and the reason for his great ideal was inseparable from his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was a child, his father often patted his head with a heartfelt heart, and lamented.
"Bole, it's better to be an official, you should remember, although money can solve everything, but will still be bullied, want not to be bullied, only to be an official, become a person of choice. "
At the beginning, Wang Baole didn't understand, until he was in primary school, because he didn't hand in his homework on time, he was scolded by the monitor, after he sent two pieces of candy, he was named by the monitor, and made a small report to the teacher, all this, left an indelible mark in his young mind.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be a monitor, not to bully people, but to avoid being bullied by others.
However, as he grew up, he found that there were still many people who could bully the monitor, so he felt that as the biggest official, that is, the President of the Federation, no one really dared to bully him. The reason why he was admitted to the Ethereal Dao Academy was also because all the high-ranking officials of the Federation graduated from the four major Dao colleges.
But his life is not good, the family blood is very wonderful, he still remembers the night a year ago, his thin father in the family temple, showed him a look at the genealogy.
That was the first time that Wang Baole saw the genealogy, he clearly saw that generations of ancestors, who weighed more than 200 jin, all died at an early age, living no more than thirty-five.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... he was reunited with those fat grandpas before he became the president of the Federation.
In the following year, for him, the matter of weight loss has risen to a certain height, but even after the Federation entered the Spiritual Age, with the richness of the aura, with the resurgence of the ancient martial arts, the methods of weight loss are also various, but Wang Baole tried almost everything, the weight is still steadily improving.
The reappearance of the memory made Wang Baole grit his teeth and make up his mind to lose weight tomorrow.
With this decision, Wang Baole immediately felt a lot less pressure, while picking his teeth, while humming a little song, looking up at the blue sky in the distance, his brain also began to liven up.
"I don't know if he likes the gift for Dr. Lu, but it's an antique I took out of my house, and the old guy will like it. "
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he met Dr. Lu, he would have a small backer in the Taoist hospital.
"Teacher's power is limited, but I will give some gifts in the future, but Dr. Lu is old, must have a lot of connections, I should take this step in the right way. "
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was happy and felt that he was one step closer to the position of President of the Federation.
He is very confident that he can become the president of the Federation, this confidence is mainly from his study of all the autobiography of high-ranking officials from childhood to college, and even summed up a few official killer mace.
At the moment, my body and mind were happy, and Wang Baole looked out of the window at the blue sky and felt very beautiful.
But soon, his eyes suddenly opened wide, and he noticed that in the distance, there was a black cloud condensation, diffuse as if to cover the sky, there was lightning in it, flashing lightning, slowly approaching, this scene also aroused the attention of many students, exclaiming.
Wang Baole was also taken aback, it was really after the Federation entered the Spiritual Era, due to the appearance of aura, resulting in a lot of amazing weather between the sky and the earth, once flying objects were difficult to be safe, which led to the birth of a hot air balloon airship driven by the spirit stone.
With the constant exclamation, the rumble of thunder suddenly came, the loud noise shocked the sky, can see the distance of the thunder and magnetic black cloud rapidly growing, the lightning has spread, like a large black net, flashing the sky, dazzling and shocking, make people's heartbeat can not help speeding up, the original flying airship, now also slowly slow down.
When the crowd was uneasy, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, as if the wind was whistling, and an old man in a white robe walked into the restaurant. The old man's face was wrinkled, but his face was fair, and his eyes were bright, and his uprightness spread all over the restaurant.
"Everyone, immediately report in the spiritual room, put on your magnetic suits, after half a pillar of incense, we will enter the mine field! "
As soon as the words came out, the students in the restaurant were in awe and stood up quickly.
Wang Baole's eyes lighted up, and the old man in front of him was Dr. Lu, who had given him a gift before, and now looking at the other side's dragon-like momentum, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was right, secretly saying that this old guy must be very good, and he was even better at chess.
When he was feeling happy, the old doctor glanced at Wang Baole, groaned, came over, took out half a black mask from his arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At a young age, don't put your mind on some messy places, you have not entered the Taoist hospital, you learned to give gifts, the old man is also a well-informed person, you have to keep this mask, you'd better keep it yourself. "The old doctor looked awe-inspiring, a clean and upright look, as if the iron hate is not the same as the general rebuke.
Wang Baole took the mask and thought to himself, seeing that the old doctor was angry and a little anxious, and just wanted to explain, but suddenly he thought of the killer's mace he had summed up in the autobiography of those high-ranking officials, one of which was to admit his mistake in front of his boss at the first time, which can often be trivialized.
Then he took a deep breath, quickly put on a look of remorse, and admitted his mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong!"
The old doctor was a little surprised, and some of the words that were to be reprimanded could not go on because they were so happy to admit their mistakes.
When Wang Baole saw the old doctor's expression, he was relieved and a little proud, saying that the autobiography of a high-ranking official was really useful.
The old doctor groaned and looked up at all the students in the restaurant, pointing to them with his right hand.
"And you, you are all future students of my ethereal school, look at what you are like these days, you must always remember, my generation of warriors, should stand up first, then speak, and then act!"
The old doctor was disgusted, and the words reverberated in the restaurant, making everyone bow their heads and feel a little ashamed, while Wang Baole's eyes lighted up and he felt it was time to express himself.
So he quickly took out a small book from his arms and recorded it on it, looking up at the old doctor from time to time, showing a listening expression, and sometimes nodding his head seriously, as if to remember every word said by the other side, this move is also his killer mace summed up in the autobiography of high-ranking officials.
When other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole like a man of God.
After seeing it, the old doctor also froze for a moment, a sense of unprecedented strangeness, I couldn't help but think, it was really that he welcomed so many students, it was the first time to meet such a wonderful person, I couldn't help but look at a few more, but gradually began to sneer.
"Little fellow, the old man's flattery is not so easy to flatter, you have to thank the thunderstorm, otherwise, the old man can train for three days and three nights at a time, I think you can write it all in a small book! "
As soon as the old doctor spoke, the momentum was different, and a strong breath came out of his body, as if it were a threat, enveloping the whole restaurant, all the students were stunned, only to feel that the battle was a step higher than the old doctor.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade tablet in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, looked at the approaching thunderstorm, and gave up the idea of taking it out, he felt that it was not humiliating to shuffle in front of his boss.
Seeing the faces of the crowd, the old doctor was proud and said a few words impassionedly.
"You remember, you should put your heart on cultivation, in the future, you can't be greedy, can't be unrighteous, and don't always want to find a female partner, you must know that a knife on the head of the word, these days, you are really disgraceful! "
Just as I was saying this, suddenly, a little voice floated out of the old doctor's voice bracelet.
"Grandpa, doctor, where are you, people can't wear this magnetic suit, you come and help me. "
When the old doctor heard the voice, his body trembled involuntarily, he coughed dryly, and stared at the crowd seriously. Then he turned away in a hurry, and at the same time, he spoke excitedly to the bracelet. "Oh, here it is, baby, I'm not in a hurry, I'll come to help you. "
The reversal of the scene was too fast, the contrast was too big, all the people were dumbfounded, even Wang Baole was stunned for a while, and only breathed for a while, as the crowd could not help but be in an uproar, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and scolded a few words.
"This old pervert, what he said before is bullshit! There are only so many female classmates, we are not enough, he is so old, and he came to rob us of resources, because of the size of an official! "
Wang Baole became more and more angry as he thought about it, and during the discussion with his classmates around him, he became more determined about his dream of becoming an official.
As the alarm increased, the crowd ended their discussion and went to the spiritual room one by one indignantly.
The spiritual room, located in the core area of the airship, is, as the name suggests, a place for these students to practice cultivation, and is also the place where the airship is most closely protected during the passage of the special area.
At this moment, in this spiritual room, as the crowd gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher who accompanied the ship in the Ethereal Daoyuan, all of them sat in several rows and put on the special magnetic suits for airships issued by the Ethereal Daoyuan.
As soon as she put on her magnetic suit, Wang Baole was immersed in her anger at Dr. Lu and looked around her at random. She was already in a depressing mood, but because of a look from a distance, she was even worse, and her brows were wrinkled unconsciously, showing a look of disgust.
Where he looked, there was a girl with slender legs sitting, very attractive, but now she was also frowning, showing disgust, and it was obvious that in their eyes, each other was familiar and disgusted.
"Bad luck!"
Both of them muttered in their hearts, and quickly avoided their eyes, as if even looking at each other, they felt hot eyes.
"Everywhere I can meet this flat-panel Du Min, I'm bored to death!" "What's so great, is not a broken squad leader, wait for the Taoyuan, with my officialdom killer mace, Lao Tzu can also mix a half-time job!"
Soon, after all the people were dressed, the teachers of the Ethereal Daoyuan with the ship checked one by one, they explained the precautions, and sternly warned the people that after the airship entered the minefield, there was danger, there must be a life-and-death crisis.
When they saw that all the people looked different, the teachers on the boat left in awe, and the door of the spiritual room was sealed directly, and the lights gradually dimmed.
Although there was still a low conversation in the spiritual room at the moment, as time went on, the sense of tension became more and more intense, gradually no one spoke, and fell into a complete silence.
In the silence that seemed to hear his heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in a rage, couldn't help but get nervous, until after the half-pillar of incense, the whole airship suddenly shocked and entered the thunder-magnetic area!
From the outside, the whole thunder-magnetic black cloud is majestic, like a big mouth, will be compared with it, very small hot air balloon airship, directly devoured.
This weather, which seems to contain the power of destruction, can sweep everything, perhaps only the shocking round of Jianyang on the sky, can ignore all, as if looking down on the world for 37 years is not enough, it will be longer.
This year is the 37th year of the Spiritual Yuan.
In A.D. 3029, the earth's science and technology developed rapidly, and there were no national borders, realizing the great unification of the earth, and entering the era of federation. It was also at this time that a big sword flew from the starry sky and penetrated the sun, causing a sensation in the world.
The hilt of the great sword, perhaps because it was broken, broke in a large number of fragments in the violent shock, scattered all over the starry sky, some of which fell on all parts of the earth.
With the arrival of the bronze sword, as the fragments fell, the earth suddenly appeared a new energy that seemed to permeate the world, an inexhaustible source of energy, later named... Aura!
Aura is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin, and because the scattered fragments were obtained by the Federation and various forces, found on it various practices related to cultivation and refinement, alchemy, and spiritual stone, the words on it are full of ancient meanings, leading people to contact with ancient texts, become a trend.
The appearance of Reiki also quickly eliminated the original energy, changed people's lives, not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the process of earth civilization, so that the whole earth, opened up the civilization of spiritual practice.
From then on, the rise of ancient martial arts, the great transformation of the world, the era of the whole people to cultivate the immortals, thus began.
History calls it the Spiritual Age.
At the moment, in the thunder-magnetic black cloud, the slow-moving red hot-air balloon airship, surrounded by countless lightning, constantly bombarded, but fortunately there is a soft light curtain to diffuse the protection left and right, making the airship incredibly stable.
As for the spiritual room in the core area of the cabin, all the students, including Wang Baole, were unconsciously asleep at the moment, as if a strange force had led them into a dream.
Only in the main cabinet in the bow of the ship, there are seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea and some smiling, talking to each other easily, which is completely different from the way they scared the students.
The leader was an old man with a wrinkled face, holding a cigarette gun and taking a puff. If Wang Baole was here, he would have recognized him at a glance, and he was the shameless old doctor Lu.
As a middle-aged teacher spoke, the old doctor, who was smoking, smiled.
