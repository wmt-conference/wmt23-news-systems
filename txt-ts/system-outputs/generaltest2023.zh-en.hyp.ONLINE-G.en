If we find that the content of this manual page is outdated and causes obvious confusion and complaints, we will stop publishing it.It is impossible to have other options, like updating the Info file and updating the man manual at the same time, because other work to maintain the Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this.The GNU project believes that the man manual is outdated and should be used elsewhere.

DESCRIPTION THE C AND C++ COMPILERS ARE INTEGRATED.They all use one or more of the four steps to process the input file: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The post-level name of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the post-level name controls the default setting:
gcc believes that the preprocessed file (.i) Is a c file, and set the connection in the form of c，
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) Is a c++ file, and sets the connection in the form of c++.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and the later operation:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c file; compile, assemble
.ii Preprocessed c++ files; compile, assemble
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor file; files with other post-level names that usually do not appear on the command line are passed to the connector (Linker).Usually includes:
.0 Object file (Object file)
.a Archive file (Archive file)
Unless the -cec,-s, or-E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), the connection is always the last step.
In the connection phase, all corresponding to the source program.e file, -1 library file, unrecognized file name (including the specified.o H standard file and.a library FILE) Pass to the connector OPTIONS in the ORDER in the COMMAND line (OPTIONS)
The option must be given separately: de' is completely different from`-d-r'.
Most`-=E: and'-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, explained in later chapters.
Code Generation Option (Code Generation Option)
Overall Option (Overall Option)
It is clearly stated that the language of the subsequent input file is language (instead of the default choice obtained from the suffix of the file name).
This option is applied to all subsequent input files until the next`-x' option is encountered.language optional
Turn off any clear description of the language, so process the subsequent files according to the file name (AS E`-x' option).
If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, connection), you can use the`-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, and the`~-c',`-s', or`-E' option to tell geo where to end.Note that some combinations of options (for example,`-x cpp-output-E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble the source file, ETER. ERA ATI by default, GCC uses `.o'Cai changed the source file name to the next level`.ec standard file name. You can use the-o option to select other names.GCC ignores any unrecognized input Wenbo -S F after the -ec option.
The target file.
It will stop after compilation and will not be assembled.
Use pipelines instead of temporary files to work at different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. The assembler of GNU does not have this problem. The C "dialect" that the assembler can accept: Supports C programs that comply with ANSI standards.
This will turn off some feature keywords in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that indicate that they are popular and rarely used, and prohibit the use of (Translation note: All standard libraries under the hosted environment are available, and the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel.The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not have a standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel.Refer to the recent information on the gcc website for details)
For function declarations without parameters, such as'int foo ();', they are processed in C style -that is, the number or type of parameters are not stated. (For C++ only).
Under normal circumstances, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The section list is deleted from here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details. We have deleted the details so that when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the`-traditional' option has an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned a value.
He has the same effect as the`-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp tries to support certain aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors.
In particular, the content about preprocessors mentioned above, but does not include other effects of the`-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the `$' character in the identifier (for C++ only).
You can specify the'"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers` option to explicitly prohibit the use of the'$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the`$' character by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows the implicit conversion of ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but vice versa.
-fexonal--templates generates smaller code (limited to c++) for template declaration by generating only one copy of each template function where they are defined for each template function.
To successfully use this option, you must mark`#Pragma implements' (definition) or`#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with`-fexental-templates', the template instantiation is all external types.You must make the required instance appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to each instance required.
Correspondingly, if the default option`-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are regarded as virtual functions of the class in which they are located.
This does not mean that every time a member function is called, it will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can judge that a virtual function can be called directly; at this time, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis--is-variable allows assigning a value to this (only for c++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++, the assignable'this` seems anachronistic.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can use the'-fthis-is-variable' option to make this operation effective.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, just like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type. It may be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolicity of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and it is expected that this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine where the program is written).
This option, and its antisense option, make such a program work on the corresponding default value.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.
If the'signed` or'unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared, these options are used to define a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.
By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers. However, if the`-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields will always be unsigned numbers.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments without special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs. It is a very bad idea for them to change the string constant. The`-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of the new crown pneumonia on the drug market
The impact may be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global new crown pneumonia epidemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has made medical services overwhelmed and almost collapsed. The restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disorders in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of this epidemic is not yet clear and difficult to predict, but it may have a far-reaching impact.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to make drugs, because restrictions on movement also restrict access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross the border due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and provision may change, and the government's ability to respond may also be hindered.
The changes brought about by the new crown pneumonia are unprecedented, but some lessons can still be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug addicts began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and their use patterns turned to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond to the current economic recession in the same way, interventions such as drug abuse prevention and related risky behaviors and drug treatment services may be hit hard.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to move.
A large number of drugs are smuggled through commercial flights in some countries, and it is expected that drug trafficking activities in these countries will be directly affected the most.
Some couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities.Due to restrictions on air passenger transportation in almost all places, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of the dark Web and the mailing of goods for trafficking may increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related closure measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to take drugs in harmful ways, suffer from drug abuse disorders, and turn to illegal drug-related activities, whether it is production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable groups and recruit new members to strengthen their teams.
As the government's ability to respond decreases, these changes may quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth model partly explains the reasons for market expansion
The phenomenon of drug abuse around the world has been increasing, both in terms of overall figures and the proportion of drug users in the world's population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug addicts, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug addicts, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
During the past two decades, the growth rate of drug abuse in developing countries has been much faster than that of developed countries.
This reflects to a certain extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but it also reflects the rapid growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug addicts.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market
Whether it is developed or developing countries, drug abuse in urban areas is higher than in rural areas.
Part of the overall increase in drug abuse is due to the large-scale movement of the population from rural areas to urban areas. At present, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared with 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.
The increase in wealth is linked to the increase in drug abuse, but it is the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease. Worldwide, drug abuse in developed countries is more common than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse among the wealthy strata of society is higher.
However, it is people of lower socio-economic status who have a higher rate of turning to drug abuse.
Data from a few countries show that there is a link between harmful drug abuse patterns and illness and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social strata.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks of the most vulnerable groups, including drug addicts.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been related to an increase in drug abuse in the past, and the epidemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
The new crown pneumonia may lead to the further expansion of the drug market. The new crown pneumonia pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either because the control capacity of the competent national authorities is reduced, or because under the economic crisis, more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities.
The restrictions related to the new crown pneumonia have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there is more smuggling than air or land.
Recently, there have been reports that cocaine shipments are shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but potentially harmful new types of opioids are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more and more complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control.The non-medical use of medicines is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of Member States every year.
At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Among the total number of new types of psychologically active substances identified in 2014, new types of psychologically active substances such as opioids accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.
Many of the new types of opiate psychoactive substances are analogues of Fentanyl. Their efficacy and harm have been proven to cause overdose deaths in North America, as well as in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a dopant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and some are used to make counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence shows that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: A study of the residues of abandoned syringes in six European cities found that many syringes are stained with new psychoactive substances that produce excitatory effects.
2The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly present in vulnerable groups
A single type of new psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe shows that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem in marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison prisoners.
Twenty-two countries have reported the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, and most of them have identified synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
The control of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate. Many chemicals that are most often used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug makers have been looking for alternatives, not only looser controlled substances, but also chemicals specially designed to evade control, the so-called “special precursor”.
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of the new crown pneumonia are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico shows that this has become a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that the shortage of methamphetamine precursor imported from East Asia prompted an increase in the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiate in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiate intercepts by the authorities of the Russian Federation has fallen by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of opiate has decreased significantly.
But the stimulant market seems to be booming day by day.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cassidones, including methamphetamine and a-pyrrolidinophenylpentanone, are now everywhere in the Russian drug market.
The Russian authorities reported that the number of clandestine processing points for the manufacture of various illegal drugs recently seized has risen sharply, more than doubling in two years and increasing to 152 processing points in 2018.
Growth of the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions have revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystallized methamphetamine has become another worrisome major drug in addition to ”fenetalin" and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug addicts saying that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than “fenetalin” or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered a number of methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board has expressed concern about the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations. methylamphetamine processing sites use these preparations as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing seems to have begun in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.
However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 1^657 kg-a sharp increase compared with the previous year.
A large number of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, which also shows that the country's production is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that legalize non-medical use of cannabis have a trend of increasing cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.
In Colorado and Washington State, the two earliest states in the United States to pass legislation, the non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, especially in the past month and the increase in daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that the use of cannabis in Uruguay has increased since 2011, and the use almost doubled last month.
This indicates that the main reason for the increase is frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also show that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage was also increasing.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still relied on illegal sources to obtain certain products.
Is the reason behind the plunge in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to the lowest level in 20 years. This is due to a decline in North American seizures, which have fallen by 84% in the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period.The pattern of seizures shows that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market have played a key role in the decline.
The supervision of new psychologically active substances seems to have a curbing effect. The effect of the supervision of new psychologically active substances in China is still difficult to evaluate.
Some countries that adopt different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates of the use of new psychoactive substances.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from the legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are mainly provided in high-income countries. Painkillers are unevenly distributed in various regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and 2% are in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but less than 10% of medicinal opioids are consumed.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug abuse disorders. In 2018, about 35.6 million people suffered from drug abuse disorders.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug abuse and exacerbate its consequences.Studies in high-income countries have confirmed this. In these studies, the unfavorable socio-economic trajectory of individuals is not only their condition at a certain point in time, but also related to the risk of drug abuse and illness.
Drug abuse can also deepen socio-economic disadvantage and further increase the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious circle of disadvantage.These results may also be related to insulting attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, groups with diverse sexual orientations, people displaced by armed conflicts or disasters, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life expectancy (DALY) index that estimates the number of healthy life expectancy years lost due to disability and premature death, in the past 10 years, harmful drug abuse has had an increased impact on a wider range of society.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life span attributable to drug abuse increased by 17%.
The increase in disability-adjusted life expectancy for liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high-reaching 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complicated and it is difficult to determine all causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data on a global scale indicate that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs.
Although drug abuse may lead to crime, in some cases, this connection can be partly attributed to a variety of intermediary factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, may be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the amount of trafficking as on certain changes that cause instability in the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Latest trends
Cannabis is the most commonly used substance for drug use, and opioids are the most harmful
It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
In contrast, there were 58 million people who used opioids in 2018.
However, the related harms of opioids are ignored because there are fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug abuse in 2017, 66% were caused by such substances, and 50% of the 21 million life span believed to have been lost due to disability or premature death caused by drug abuse was caused by such substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, tramadol is exacerbating the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl.The two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographic statistics, or general drug abuse patterns, but they are both struggling to combat the opioid crisis driven by easily available and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of deaths from opioid overdoses in the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but the number is lower.
Part of the reason for overdose deaths caused by fentanyl is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for tramadol for non-medical purposes has grown significantly.
In this region, more and more patients with tramadol use disorders are receiving treatment.
In 2017, the number of tramadol intercepted worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
What contributed to the crises in these two places was the simplicity of manufacturing and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What makes the crisis in these two places worse is that these substances are available in both the drug market and the illegal market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of stimulants is increasing
The field of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, and the use of these two substances in their main markets is on the rise.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, because cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, of which methamphetamine was the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes replacing each other, so that when the use of one drug rises, the use of the other drops, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet the demand of the same market.
New crown pneumonia increases the risk of injecting drug users
It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people who used injecting drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
There are more than 1 million people infected with HIV by injecting drug users and 5.5 million people suffering from hepatitis C.
In 2017, there were about 585,000 deaths due to drug abuse, half of which died of liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C of injecting drug users has still not been treated.
5The shortage of opioids caused by the restrictive measures of the new crown pneumonia may cause users to replace more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may occur.

The EU summit is in a difficult policy debate, EU officials: The receiving process is a bottleneck step by step- <url>
The EU summit quarreled over refugee policy endlessly. EU officials: There are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process.
[Niu Ruifei, special correspondent of the Global Times in Belgium] According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's move is a response to Europe's growing concern about illegal immigration. Today, the core problem of the EU is that the number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be returned is very small.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds” to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and member states quarreled endlessly on issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for related expenses.
But diplomats from some member states said that if the EU can share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it will free up national budgets for countries to speed up the construction process.
According to the European Euractivity website, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. The limited reception capacity and the overwhelmed immigration authorities of member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting “countless” asylum applications in EU countries, and the EU's refugee reception system is in an almost “permanent crisis.”
According to estimates by the European Commission, the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.
At the same time, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a “principle” that EU countries can return illegal immigrants to their countries in accordance with a court decision of another member state.
In addition, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of a safe country,” which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The U.S. upgrades the "chip war” and hits the global semiconductor industry hard- <url>
Recently, the “chip war” between the United States and China has greatly upgraded-first, the Netherlands and Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting U.S. suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order to restrict U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries...Soon after the start of the new year in 2023, the United States will continue to make bad moves in curbing the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to combat the development of China's “core”. While accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it has built a “de-sinicized” semiconductor industry chain alliance, aiming to completely “get rid” of China in the advanced semiconductor industry. China.
Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a “technological alliance”, to establish a chip “quartet alliance” with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or to establish a “small circle” of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the “four-sided mechanism” of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, and the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework”, the United States has introduced politicization, campization, and weaponization into the semiconductor industry in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the “core tactics” of the United States against China with great fanfare are also “hurting the enemy by one thousand and self-harming by eight hundred.”
Recently, Panlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography machine giant Asma Holding Company of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to higher semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government implemented an outrageous crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies have suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain down.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to professional estimates, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regionalization of the “small circle” led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously "reshaped” and "de-sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, which has hit the global semiconductor industry hard.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the joint participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the “Innovation and Competition Act”, "U.S. Competition Act of 2022" and "Chip and Science Act" to take advantage of technological hegemony and consolidate its own technological leadership; "Enmity and coercion" to its allies, inducing Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturing companies to set up factories in the United States, and strive to ensure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States has suppressed hysterically, forcing the Chinese chip industry to continue to break through, causing itself to lose the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology companies, and harm the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products are on sale and can only be held for a minimum of 360 days- <url>
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale
The 7 products of this organization are optional and can only be held for a minimum of 360 days.
Personal pension wealth management products are finally online.
On February 10th, <url> released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products, and seven personal pension wealth management products of ICBC Financial Management, ABCI Financial Management and China Post Financial Management were officially launched.
At this point, the “shelves” of personal pension accounts have finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension financial management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public fund.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all public equity-type open-ended products, including 5 newly issued products and 2 surviving products. Except for 1 product, which is a mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
Reporters from Beijing Youth Daily saw that 4 of the 5 newly issued products came from ICBC Financial Management, all of which were fixed income products. The minimum holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days, respectively, and the corresponding performance comparison benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70 % - 4.20 % 、 4.10 % - 4.60 % 、 4.40 % - 4.90 % 、 5.25 % - 5.75 % 。
The remaining newly issued product is "Postbank Wealth Tianyi*Hongjin Minimum Holding No. 1 for 1095 Days"” which is also a fixed income product. It began to be raised on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is Level 2.
Among the two surviving products, one is the 360-day scientific and technological innovation RMB wealth management product of ABCI Financial Management “ABCI Concentric·Smart”. The investment nature is mixed and the risk level is Level 3.
Another surviving product is "Postbank Wealth Tianyi*Hongjin Minimum Holding 365 Days No. 1", a fixed income type, which started raising on December 30 last year and officially operated on January 4 this year. The cumulative net worth on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions", the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public equity funds, etc.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products are on sale, marking that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the three departments of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice clarifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in 36 leading cities and regions such as Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New District, Hebei, and Jincheng City, Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in personal pensions was 19.54 million, the number of contributors was 6.13 million, and the total contribution amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public funds.
Nowadays, after personal pension wealth management products are also gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the Research and Development department of Wealth management products of the Bank of Communications said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products in the pilot phase have three characteristics.
First, robustness, a more sound risk management mechanism, a more robust investment strategy and philosophy, and the implementation of independent escrow by a third party other than the parent bank.
The second is the long-term nature. The term of pension wealth management products in the pilot phase is 5 years and above. In principle, the minimum holding period for personal pension wealth management products issued in the next step is 1 year, and it is encouraged to hold for more than 3 years.
The third is universality. The threshold for product purchase is low. The starting point of purchase is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The escrow fee, management fee and other rates of the product are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long maturity, high interest rates, and high security, and are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, which is more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; and personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not protect capital or income, there is a certain investment risk, but the expected return is higher, and it is suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-taking ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust- <url>
Another large gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the issue of rights protection of members of Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness institution, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not open normally. Subsequently, rumors about the closure of the organization caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded and promised to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members before the storm could subside.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions had operating problems and were temporarily closed. Consumers could have calmed down and waited for the problem to be resolved. Why did many members' first reaction be “Something is wrong”?
Behind the turmoil in the rights protection of health club members is the deep-seated problem of the crisis of trust in the industry.
Traditional domestic gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money that users can't get” is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-sale membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to cycle back and forth, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information in industries such as gym running away frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms are of course a good business with a “money path”.
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always received capital attention.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of healthy living deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the development of the fitness industry has great potential.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery. As soon as they came out of the crisis, they sounded the horn of expanding their territory and invested their financing funds in the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn and the industry has been reshuffled. It is not a new opportunity for powerful companies to selectively increase their acquisitions and re-layout at this time.
However, if the development of the fitness market is to enter a virtuous circle and embark on a stable and far-reaching road to prosperity, the industry must change its traditional model and change its business strategy.
Only by fighting steadily and re-establishing consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared with Dajian Xindian to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs is to calm down and optimize services, and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we must rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry. Their essence is to adhere to “user-oriented”, closely focus on user needs, and focus on service quality improvement and upgrading.
Secondly, it is necessary to rely on digital transformation to improve the user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model realizes user pay-per-view and venue selection.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can be met, and a complete closed loop of services from online to offline can be realized.
There is no private education promotion and no huge annual card. Users' concerns about fitness institutions “running away” are reduced, and their sense of trust is increased.
In addition, we must actively explore multiple formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scene consumption. Health clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Buy expensive and refund the difference!
Nanjing's property market reproduces “price difference compensation”- <url>
Yangtze Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangtze Evening News/Zin Niu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the “price guarantee agreement” that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market. A real estate in Jiangbei New District claims “price difference compensation”. Before the delivery of the house, the discount of other listings is greater than the previous discount, and the developer is willing to exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many conditions for the "Price guarantee agreement”
This real estate in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. The buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a “statement” when he visited the real estate last weekend.
The picture he sent to reporters shows that the developer of the real estate promised that anyone who purchases a listing from February 1st to February 28th will be delivered to the corresponding listing from the date of signing the sale and purchase contract between the two parties. If the discount of other listings in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type as the commercial house), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price guarantee agreement”. The purpose is to let buyers rest assured that they don't have to worry about the price reduction and promotion of the development company. “Now I'm afraid that the price will be reduced after buying it. Go to the sales office and make trouble. There is no time. If you don't make trouble, it's really sweet.”
There are also many buyers who believe that although the “price guarantee agreement” is giving buyers “peace of mind”, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a newly needed house in Jiangbei, said that the insured listing first needs the same apartment type, but also in the same building and the same unit. There are very few listings where buyers can compare prices, so the “threshold” is still quite high.
Some buyers also believe that due to the asymmetry of information, additional concessions are not ruled out when selling, and it is not difficult for buyers to “defend their rights”.
Whether it can retain buyers remains to be seen
The reporter inquired on Nanjing online real estate and learned that the real estate received a total of 252 sales permits for the two buildings in November last year. The apartment area is 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of the fully renovated sales permit is 39,843 yuan/㎡.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the real estate is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, and the number of unsold units is 113. Of the 124 units in Building 7, 44 are unsold, and the total number of units sold in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, the “price guarantee agreement” also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate on Huangshan Road, Hexi, launched a “Price Guarantee Plan” in order to attract the attention of buyers. The specific content is "The company solemnly promises that if the project discount is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owner according to the difference."
Since then, in April 2011, nine real estate companies in Nanjing have also taken out some of their listings and promised to “pay the difference.”
“The property market is picking up, and a ‘tonic’ is needed at this time.
“Mr. Shen, a senior trader in Nanjing's real estate industry, said that ”price guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that nowadays, development companies need more confidence than buyers, and the launch of ”price guarantee agreements" is actually cheering them up.
As for whether he can retain buyers, he said it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds. For now, it remains to be seen.
A number of data show that Taiwan's economy performed poorly in the first year of the recession- <url>
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) Export trade volume has been “black for five consecutive years”, the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) has tightened for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen the “3 prefix”... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Expert analysis believes that Taiwan's economy has performed poorly in the opening year, and the growth pressure is not small.
According to the announcement by the competent financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were US331.51 billion, a decrease of 21.2% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export volume of the 11 main export categories all declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastics, rubber and its products, and optical equipment suffered the deepest declines, down 37.6% and 35.7% year-on-year, respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decrease in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of statistics of the department, said that this shows that the effect of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports fell in January, with an excess of only US22.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The competent financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the decline in global terminal demand and the adjustment of industrial inventories have suppressed manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials. The export decline is difficult to see an improvement in the short term. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the release of the China Institute of Economic Research of Taiwan, the Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 40.4% seasonally adjusted in January this year, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and it has been tightening for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI takes 50% as the prosperity and dry line, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents the expansion of the boom, and vice versa is contraction.
Among the five constituent indicators of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment tightened, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory tightened.
The six major industries all reported PMI contraction, and each industry was ranked according to the rate of contraction as the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the “Comptroller General's Office” of the Taiwan Authorities announced that the annual increase in Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, which has exceeded 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's “Comptroller General's Office”, admitted that the increase in vegetable prices did exceed expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, based on media reports from the island such as “Lianhe Zaobao” and "Yahoo Finance", experts expressed pessimism.
Wu Daren, a professor in the Department of Economics of Taiwan's “Central University”, analyzed that the export recession may cause cash outflows from export manufacturing manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the decrease in orders has led manufacturers to reduce labor costs, affecting the labor market and the household economy, which in turn has impacted consumption power.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
Since Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, affected by the export downturn, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
“An important engine of Global recovery”- <url>
“In response to the impact of the new crown epidemic, China's economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary consultant of China Policy Watch, said in an interview with our reporter recently that the current epidemic prevention and control in China has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of the impact of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China has unswervingly expanded its opening up to the outside world, the endogenous power of economic development has been continuously enhanced, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have developed in concert.
Every year, the two National Congresses of China are held to discuss the national development plan and discuss hot issues of people's livelihood on behalf of the members, so as to gather consensus, unite people's hearts, and gather wisdom to add strength to China's development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and is currently entering a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and China's solutions, and looks forward to China's development bringing new opportunities to the world.
"Rios said that at present, China is fully promoting scientific and technological innovation and injecting new impetus into economic and social development. “Capital investment, talent training, and policy incentives have made China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan.”
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a difficult task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has given full play to the strengths of the market economy and the advantages of the socialist system, and taken proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis point of expanding domestic demand, we will increase financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the people's multi-level diversified consumer needs... China fully, accurately and comprehensively implements the new development concept, strives to promote high-quality development, and builds a new development pattern that will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative.
“The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
"Rios said he looked forward to the cooperation in the construction of the “Belt and Road” to continue to play its important role in improving the level of infrastructure in various countries and strengthening the interconnection of various fields, and to continue to release greater momentum.

Save half or more of the cost?
Henan Province regulates and integrates the price of oral implant medical services- <url>
CCTV news: Dental implants are an ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the price of tens of thousands of yuan a piece has always discouraged many patients.
Since this year, with the acceleration of the collection of dental implants, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the price of a single conventional implant dental treatment service in Henan Province will be regulated at 4,300 yuan for the whole process, and the cost of a single conventional implant for the whole process will not be higher than 97% of the regulatory target.
Dental implants refer to a method of repairing missing teeth based on the lower structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and retain the upper tooth prosthesis.
The reporter learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that taking a single conventional planting as an example, the price from planting to final repair is about 16,000 to 7,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in a situation like mine, it is almost 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, which can basically save half.
On the basis of the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implant medical service price items such as “implant implantation fee (single piece)”, and unified the prices of provincial-administered public medical institutions and medical insurance payment categories, cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant implantation.
Li Yunjie, director of the Pharmaceutical Price and Bidding and Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Municipal Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are four parties. One is medical insurance. The expenditure on medical insurance is less; the hospital's share is less, and the patient will increase appropriately; for suppliers, a market has been obtained; for our patients, it is the most profitable party, and the cost of planting a tooth may have to be halved or even more.

“New variables” have emerged in China's e-commerce industry. How can the delivery of goods be “content is king”?
-China News Network
<url>, February 11th Topic: “New variables” have emerged in China's e-commerce industry. How can the delivery of goods be “content is king”?
China-Singapore Financial Reporter Xia Bin
“We entered the e-commerce market late, but we realized from the beginning that content is very important to stand out from the millions of stores.
”Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, now operates a nourishing food store on Douyin e-commerce, allowing an offline store with a history of more than 30 years to “blossom” online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong movies and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, open the @Fangfang one-person food Douyin account. The exquisite videos are refreshing.
At the recently held Douyin e-commerce “Looking for Peers· High-quality Content sharing Session”, Fangfang spoke as a representative of high-quality creators and introduced her daily creative experience and experience.
She said at the scene: “The carefully polished video has gained the attention of many netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients of my family and want to cook food together, so the sales market suddenly opened.
”
Fangfang relied on the soup-making video to make more people fall in love with the ”taste of Laoguang". A live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving her family's old shop that was on the verge of collapse.
“No content, no e-commerce”, with the continuous development of short videos and live e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of the development of live broadcast with goods, live broadcast studios often used low-cost discounts to attract users, and price advantages seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there have been both phenomenon-level big V's such as Liu Yuhong and Dongfang Selection, as well as many people and businesses that are not well-known to the public in vertical segments. They have continuously created high-quality content that meets the tone of their own brand to enhance long-term business efficiency.
Gao Yaxuan, head of star author operations for Douyin e-commerce, introduced that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized content through Douyin e-commerce, and their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total turnover has more than doubled.
“Behind these numbers, we can feel a vigorous and vigorous author ecology.
"Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the “E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report”, which analyzes the importance of high-quality content, a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry, from the data dimension, and uses the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China. The ecological situation was evaluated.
According to the ranking of the ecological health index of the content of the e-commerce industry in the above report, Douyin e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and Jingdong ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production of content) and UGC (user original content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value, the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption that are gradually integrated and distributed in the public and private sectors.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor of the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from “consumer accessibility” to “consumer quality” stage, and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the “hard currency” of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and gripper of the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOL (key opinion leaders) have begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of content structure improvement, create positive content creation and management standards, and realize the index and dynamic balance of the content ecological health system of the e-commerce industry.
The other is from the perspective of external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
“In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to form a forecast of the stability of future development; in addition, it will provide businesses with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and create a healthy content ecosystem.

The margin trading business of the Beijing Stock Exchange will start next week- <url>
Newspaper news (reporter Sun Jie) Last night, the Beijing Stock Exchange released news that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the margin trading business of the Beijing Stock Exchange will be officially launched on February 13. At that time, securities companies that have obtained the margin trading authority of the Beijing Stock Exchange can accept investors' commissions and declare margin trading to the Beijing Stock Exchange.
The list of the first batch of 56 underlying stocks for margin financing is determined on January 31, 2023 as the calculation base date.
The Beijing Stock Exchange said that the list of stocks subject to margin financing and the list of margin-deductible securities will be announced through the “Information Disclosure-Margin financing Information” section of the official website of the Beijing Stock Exchange to facilitate investors' inquiries.
Margin financing is an important basic system in the securities market and a more mature trading method in the international securities market.
On September 2 last year, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the announcement of its establishment, the Beijing Stock Exchange publicly solicited opinions on the margin business.
The launch of margin trading on the Beijing Stock Exchange is an important measure to continuously promote the construction of the market system of the Beijing Stock Exchange, improve the trading mechanism, and enhance the pricing function of the secondary market.
The margin system is conducive to enriching investors' trading strategies, meeting investors' diversified trading needs, promoting market price discovery, and further enhancing market liquidity.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th Topic: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project-Four Theories, a deep understanding of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening of the seminar on learning and implementing the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party
Commentator of Xinhua News Agency
“Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires comprehensive consideration, systematic planning, and overall promotion, and correctly handles a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and strategy, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
”At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to learn and implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the Party's 20th National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be dealt with in practice, which provides a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It is related to the governance of the party, the country, the army, internal affairs, diplomacy, and national defense. It is necessary not only to make systematic plans, but also to have the courage to reform and innovate, and continuously achieve overall advancement.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have a deep insight into the general development trend of the world, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated planning and policy system reflects the times, grasps regularity, and is full of creativity, so as to achieve a combination of distance and near, top-to-bottom connection, and content coordination.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking. There are still many uncharted areas that need to be boldly explored in practice and promoted through reform and innovation. We must not seek swords and wait for the hare.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking strategy, foresee the future and lead the future with a scientific strategy; to enhance the global nature of the strategy, focusing on solving major issues related to the rise and fall of the party and the national cause, which affect the whole body; to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, it is necessary to persevere for a long time, grasp it to the end, and do good deeds.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unified relationship between strategy and strategy, organically combine the principle of strategy with the flexibility of strategy, be flexible, adaptable, and make decisions on the spot, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions, moving according to the situation, and taking advantage of the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
To deal with the relationship between integrity and innovation, we must not only abide by the origin and source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, and unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization to ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize changes and adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, and constantly shape new kinetic energy and advantages for development, so as to fully stimulate the vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also more effectively maintain social fairness, and better realize the balance, promotion, and unification of efficiency and fairness.
Handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness well, and continuously realize that development is for the people, development depends on the people, and the results of development are shared by the people, so that the results of modernization can benefit all the people more and more fairly.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to deal with the relationship between vitality and order so that society can be both vibrant and stable and orderly.
It is necessary to co-ordinate the two major events of development and security, implement the overall concept of national security, improve the national security system, strengthen the ability to maintain national security, and firmly maintain the security of national power, institutional security, ideological security, and key areas.
Not only do we pay more attention to security factors in development, enhance national security strength through development, and use development results to consolidate the foundation of national security, but we are also good at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving healthy interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only adhere to our own path, but also expand the vision of the world, adhere to opening up to the outside world, and constantly expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must adhere to independence, self-reliance and self-improvement, insist on putting the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, and insist on firmly holding the fate of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continue to expand high-level opening up to the outside world, deeply participate in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win situation.
Only by following the way can we go far.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in the new era, grasp the rules, practice without slackening, give full play to enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, properly handle a series of major relationships, and work hard on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, and constantly open up a new realm of Chinese-style modernization.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of participating in the spy balloon program.
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that these five Chinese companies and one research institute have helped modernize the Chinese military, especially aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
It is difficult for blacklisted companies to obtain U.S. technology exports.
The list is called the ”entity list" (entity list). Unless the listed companies obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce, they will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., the 48th Research Institute of China Electronic Technology Group, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House said it was considering broader measures to “expose and deal with” China's larger surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between China and the United States, and U.S. Secretary of State Blinken cancelled his visit to China.
The United States shot down the balloon on February 4, and the Chinese government submitted serious negotiations to the U.S. Embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously impacting and harming the efforts and processes of the two sides to stabilize Sino-U.S. relations.
From the existing wreckage evidence and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon “has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army” and is an approved supplier by the Chinese military.
Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding the accidental incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship straying into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the United States Congress are purely political manipulation and speculation.
China is strongly dissatisfied with this and resolutely opposes it.
Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: “Today's actions demonstrate our joint efforts to identify and prevent China from using spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

(German Voice Chinese network) It has been a few days since the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is getting slimmer. However, the family of five rescued on Saturday made the search and rescue personnel feel extremely relieved.
According to the Associated Press, in the town of Nurdayy, the hardest-hit area in Gaziantep Province, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the ruins for more than five days.
The search and rescue personnel first pulled out the mother and daughter from a pile of ruins, and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers rang out in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmarash, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued under severe cold weather conditions.
“What day is it today?
”--The teenager who was trapped under the ruins for 129 hours asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the ground.
A man from Kahramanmarash is holding his newly rescued cat
The miraculous successful rescue cases have brought a glimmer of light to the search and rescue work that had been promising, but at the same time, the number of people killed is also rising.
According to official statistics, Monday's earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be more than 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week at most after being trapped in the ruins, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to explore signs of life under the ruins.
At the same time, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift to helping survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.
UN official: A disaster “not encountered in a hundred years” in the region
Martin Griffith, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said at a press conference in Turkey that the earthquake was “the worst disaster in a hundred years” in the region.
He also praised Turkey's response after the disaster as “extraordinary.”
He also told Reuters reporters that he hopes to be able to provide relief to areas controlled by the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said that related matters are “not yet clear.”
The United Nations has promised to provide an additional US225 million in relief donations to the people in the earthquake-stricken areas of Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced an allocation of 25 million U.S. dollars for disaster relief in Turkey and Syria.

We must strive to master the skill of Marxist theory, consciously use the Party's innovative theory to arm the mind, guide practice, and promote work, and work hard on deep learning, careful understanding, and committed practice to truly learn firm belief, absolute loyalty, and mission responsibility.

It is necessary to keep in mind that comprehensive and strict governance of the Party is always on the way, and the Party's self-revolution is always on the way. We must tighten and consolidate the political responsibilities of comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, take the Party's political construction as the leader, and deeply promote the new great project of Party construction in the new era.
It is necessary to strengthen the ability to promote high-quality development, serve the masses, and prevent and resolve risks, develop the style of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.

Google AI chatbot “answered the wrong question” The parent company's stock price evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars
(Comprehensive 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard was unfavorable. It “answered the wrong question” in the promotional video, which caused the share price of Google's parent company Alphabet to fall sharply by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the美元100 mark, and its market capitalization evaporated by 110 billion US dollars (about 476.5 billion ringgits). As of Friday's close, the market was at 94.57 US dollars.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as good as rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google released a promotional video of the AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier. In the video, someone asked Bard: “Can I tell my 9-year-old about the new discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
"Bard mentioned in his answer that the telescope had taken the first picture of an extrasolar planet.
However, according to NASA, the first photo of an extrasolar planet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2004.
"Reuters" also reported on the topic ”Alphabet's stock price plummeted after Bard answered incorrectly."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response “highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process” and will combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response “meets high standards based on quality, safety, and truthful information.”

The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that inbound tourists in 2022 have increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the Tourism Board's earlier estimate of 4 million to 6 million, and tourists have returned to the pre-epidemic level of 33%.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled S新8.96 billion. It is expected that the annual tourism revenue in 2022 will reach S新13.8 billion to S新14.3 billion, an increase of 6 to 7 times from S新1.89 billion in 2021, and it has returned to the level of about 50% to 52% before the New Crown epidemic in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures at the same time to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the Government announced an allocation of nearly S新500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Bureau recently announced that it plans to allocate S新110 million from this budget in the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and health one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board released a solicitation of intent on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and health attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Health Tourism of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put physical health at the top of various considerations.
The development of a health and health attraction in the Southern Marina District, which owns Gardens by the Bay and Marina Embankment, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay in Singapore longer.
Chen Jianlong, director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in the next few years, health and health will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The new Crown epidemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health programs to the local public and international tourists in the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health Festival, providing the public with more than 130 various health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide tourists with new travel experiences.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World in Gardens by the Bay, the Sentosa Central Beach Market, the new “Exploring New Areas” exhibition hall of the Artscience Museum, and the newly built amphitheater in the Night Safari Park, the Tourism Bureau will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park in the World of Wild Animals, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will formulate relevant industry standards for the sustainable development of the conference, exhibition and incentive tourism industry within 2023, and focus on improving waste treatment and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data show that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport's passenger traffic has recovered strongly, receiving as many as 150,000 passengers per day, about 1 million passengers per week, which is equivalent to about 75% of the pre-COVID-19 epidemic. The number of employees in the aviation industry has also returned to the level of about 90% before the epidemic.
Data show that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, which is equivalent to 42% of the pre-COVID-19 epidemic, and 170,000 take-off and landing flights, which is 53% of the pre-epidemic level.
The rapid recovery of tourism has also driven the pace of recovery in industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, assistant director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by the Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the New Crown epidemic, about 3.6 million people in China traveled to Singapore for vacation every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists will recover to 30% to 60% in 2019 this year.
Ke Shudan pointed out that in the future, the Tourism Bureau will pay close attention to the further signals released by China's outbound travel policy to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to the new trends in overseas travel in China.
Looking forward to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is full of confidence that as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession affecting public income, and there are no new large-scale deadly outbreaks, the pace of tourism recovery will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interact intimately and his wife is left out in the cold
(Comprehensive 11th) North Korea held a military parade for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Army on the evening of the 8th. The daughter of leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-ae, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean state media announced the video on the 9th. Kim Jong-ae snuggled next to her father, looking at each other warmly and whispering several times. She gently held her father's cheek with both hands, and even touched her father's chest. The interactive picture of father and daughter was broadcast to the whole country.
However, the first lady Li Xuejun could only retreat to the side.
Based on South Korea's “North Korea News” and other reports, Kim Jong-un, Li Xuejun and his wife took their daughter Kim Jae-ae to attend the dinner on the 7th. In the official group photo, Kim Jae-ae not only rarely sat in the middle of her parents in the C position, she also boarded the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary military parade on the evening of the next day.
North Korea's state-run media “North Korea Central Television" later released a video of the military parade, exposing more pictures of father and daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium. The smiles on the faces of the two never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Jong-un held his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un also responded with a big smile.
Other state media footage also showed that when Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-un were sitting on the indoor sofa and chair, they kept touching their father's face with their hands; when she walked arm in arm with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands.
The first lady, Li Xuejun, can only walk behind or sit aside throughout the process, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Jong-ae first showed his face in public with the test launch of the Mars 17 missile on November 18 last year, the probability of exposure has been getting higher and higher in the past three months, and it is the fifth time he has appeared on a formal occasion.
When North Korean state media mentioned Kim Jong-ae, they used extremely high honorific titles such as dearest child and noble child. They also broadcast clips of Kim Jong-ae repeatedly shouting and vowing to support the white-headed bloodline when he was in the stands overlooking the military parade.
These signs have made the outside world wonder whether Kim Jong-il has been internally designated as the heir to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that “this is a signal that Kim Jong-un has promoted his middle-school-age daughter to the position of successor.” However, there are also views that such a judgment is still too early. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knee, there are still various possibilities.
Chongyang Q&A-How to view the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeded expectations and future trends-Economic Watch-Professional Financial News Website
Q: What does Chongyang Investment think of the US non-farm payrolls data for January that exceeded expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, with 517,000 new non-farm payrolls, which was significantly higher than the 189,000 expected by the market; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew by 4.4% year-on-year, and the growth rate was 0.3% sequentially, a slight slowdown.
From the overall point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors in the data this time, such as the number of faculty and staff returning from strikes, the revision of survey statistics, and the update of seasonal adjustment factors. There may be revisions in the future (refer to the new non-farm payrolls in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as the data shows.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and data show that the labor gap in the service industry still exists.
Combined with the equally larger-than-expected service industry PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. service industry has ushered in a rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be difficult to improve without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the excess savings of U.S. residents and the strength of consumer credit, the strength of consumer demand will cause the impact of tightening policies on the job market to lag further.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background of the U.S. economy in 2023.
Given that the current interest rate hike is nearing the end and inflation expectations continue to repeat, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange market's expectations of the Fed's interest rate hike path were too optimistic.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate increases while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. Not only is it expected to stop raising interest rates early, but it is also expected to cut interest rates twice at the end of the year.
In the case of tight supply and demand in the labor market and the unknown impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance for raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and the crowding of transactions may cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the negative year-on-year M2 data and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only support future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of games after the next inflation data is released.
Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He led the transformation of China's first clothing stock. -Economic Watch-Professional financial news website
Economic Observer reporter Zheng Zhixin on February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanshan Holdings”), the main body of the certification, published an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the Board of Directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to a sudden heart disease. Invalid treatment.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory. With the transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares, in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Companies, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH ) Listed, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market. Shanshan suits want to dominate for a long time, and it is unlikely that they will become the national service of Chinese people for a long time.”
In 1999, Shanshan began to study corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, “We came to Shanghai to find out what to do with the transformation. We specially found many experts and scholars, and held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreats continuously. Seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, the carbon Research Institute of Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy supporting Ansteel was working on the national 863 project, and the scientific research funds were not enough, so Shanshan and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the National 863 project “Intermediate phase carbon microspheres” project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of anode materials, and realize the commercial promotion of anode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres and began to replace them with localization, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres in China.
This is the first manufacturer of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries in China, and it has realized the localization of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Shares began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery materials business was included in the main business of Shanshan Shares, and the proportion of revenue from the clothing business decreased year by year. Until 2013, Shanshan Shares' lithium battery materials business revenue fully surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Shares successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company Shanjin Optoelectronics. The technical content in this field is relatively high. Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "Chinese private companies acquire some international high-tech companies with a relatively low probability of success. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, right? This is an act that is usually done.” However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to announce in public that Shanshan, as the majority shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise and two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, people from Shanshan enterprises are not sent to Shanjin and adopt an authorized operation method. The original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models remain unchanged.
According to the 2022 negative electrode data released by ICC Xinshun Information, Shanshan's negative electrode shipments in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, a year-on-year increase of 100%, and its market share reached 16%. The shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode materials ranked first.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics' global market share will reach 29% in 2022, and it is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan's revenue was 15.841 billion yuan and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, Shanshan's share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market capitalization of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9th, Shanshan Shares said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphitization production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization production capacity of the Meishan project is still climbing.
According to Wonder, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
Tianyan Inspection showed that Zheng Yonggang's total shareholding in Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. was 40.1%.
The general manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and Deputy General Manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
Shanshan Shares stated on the investor interaction platform on February 10 that there is no kinship relationship between the company's senior management and the actual controller of the company.
”Fund E account" is here: the SFC authorized the development of all funds under the investor's name to realize the collection and inquiry-Economic Watch-Professional financial news website
Chen Shan, a reporter for <url>, said that the complicated purchase channels of funds make it difficult to collect account information?
Always forget the "little vault”?
These problems of the CDU are about to be resolved.
On February 10th, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that the “Fund E Account” APP was launched in various mobile app stores and launched a public trial operation.
According to reports, the “Fund E account” provides individual investors with a “one-stop” query service for public fund account and share information, aiming to solve the pain points of the majority of small and medium-sized investors' forgotten accounts, cumbersome inquiries and other industry services.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there are 156 public fund managers in China, with a fund size of about 26 trillion yuan under management; 167 public fund share registration agencies and 411 public fund sales agencies.
The account systems of each share registration agency are independent of each other, and there is a lack of a unified inquiry channel for the industry.
Some industry sources said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in our country, that is to say, half of the people in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to check the purchase status through different sales agencies, and through the “Fund E account”, they could check the purchase status of all sales channels, and the status of holding funds was clear at a glance.
What is the ”Fund E Account" APP?
According to relevant documents, the “Fund E Account” APP is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and built by China Clearing with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query on the OTC share holdings of public fund products in the whole market.
Through the “Fund E account”, investors can easily and quickly grasp the holdings of the OTC shares of the public fund products of each fund manager purchased through various sales channels in the market, and comprehensively improve the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the “Fund E Account” includes: fund account information opened at various public fund managers in the market, trading account information opened at public fund sales agencies, and OTC share holdings of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans that are not limited to 200 investors established and managed by securities companies.
Liu Yiqian, head of the business of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told reporters from the Economic Observation Network that investors can learn about all their OTC public fund holdings through the “Fund E Account” App in one stop, helping them retrieve “forgotten assets”, and more importantly, for customers to achieve a comprehensive fund investment situation. The full account information is collected to help customers more timely, accurate and complete grasp of their own investment situation, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register for use?
The reporter noticed that at present, the “Fund E Account” APP has been listed on mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, etc., but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage. You need to fill in the invitation code to register. Investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain it.
The customer service staff of a large and medium-sized public equity fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to a reporter from <url>, and told the reporter, “During the trial operation of the APP, China Clearing provides each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes. Investors call to get them, and we will provide them.
After the trial operation is over, the invitation code will not be used when the user registration is opened.
”
The reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the relevant documents of the “Fund E Account” download and usage instructions published on the official website of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the ”Assets" fund binding button. All fund products purchased by reporters through each fund sales platform are presented in the list of binding options (accounts can be bound). After the binding is completed, you can visually see the total assets of the invested fund and you can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E Account" only provides investors with inquiry services and cannot be used for redemption transactions.
The data date displayed in the “Fund E Account” is generally the date on which the user made the query (T day), which is pushed forward by three trading days.
For example, if the “Fund E Account” is opened on February 10, the corresponding date of total assets, fund shares, and fund equity displayed on the asset page is three trading days before that date, that is, February 7.

Reached a defense consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines against the CCP
ASIA-On February 9th, Philippine President Bongbong Marcus visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's encroachment on the South and East China Seas. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting saying that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcus visited China in early January this year and won an agreement worth 20 billion U.S. dollars.
But after that, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, but they declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the United States military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations at bases in the Philippines.
The Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the United States to build an “arc against the CCP” in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: Welcome to Lvying to visit Lu under the 92nd Consensus
Xia Liyan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of China in Taiwan, met with Song Tao, director of the State Taiwan Office of China, and Wang Huning, Member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, during his visit to China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior consultant of the National Government Foundation, the official organ of the Kuomintang, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency last night and positively commented on what Song Tao said to Xia Liyan. As long as he agrees with the “92 Consensus” and the anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes people from the green camp to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang evaluated it as a novelty.
This statement was not mentioned in the news of the day Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has clarified for days that it refuses to accept the “92 Consensus.”
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit Lu. During his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao, the new director of the State Taiwan Office, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and talked about the “92 Consensus” and anti-Taiwan independence as the political foundation of the Communist Party of China. Zhao Chunshan, a senior consultant of the Kuomintang National Government Foundation, said at the meeting that the Kuomintang's “92 Consensus” is the authentic “92 Consensus.”
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In the recent video discussion with the mainland academic community, and in this discussion, no Taiwan-related scholars were heard talking about martial arts and the "anti-secession law". Instead, exchanges and dialogues were resumed.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-Strait war is dangerous, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, the other party is still willing to do a good job of working with Taiwanese, which means that it does not want cross-Strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao to say, “You must implement the requirements made by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen).” If it cannot be resolved comprehensively, it must also be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang people's visit to the mainland mentioned in person the daily disturbance of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether reporters from the Central News Agency asked such questions in interviews.
French trade unions once again mobilized anti-government retirement reform plan parade
On Saturday (February 11), the French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action against the social trend of the draft reform of the government's pension system.
And how many people respond to the call for the rally may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight major French trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and it is also the first time that the protest has scheduled a rally on Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday, they do not need to choose between participating in demonstrations and protests or strikes with wages deducted. Therefore, trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more people to participate.
The labor unions of the bus system, the subway, and the public railway company did not call for employees to strike today. The bus system should be able to operate normally. Citizens can take a bus to the meeting place. At the same time, in areas where the school starts the winter vacation, people can leave for vacation normally.
Trade union groups hope that more than one million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect that the number of participants across the country may be between 600,000 and 800,000, and 90,000 to 120,000 people may gather in urban Paris.
Since the beginning of the anti-government pension reform protests, although opinion polls have shown that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually took to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31st gathered 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
The number of demonstrations on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and two million people across the country.
This pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
Opposition parties, especially the opposition group led by the Radical Left, have submitted countless amendments, so that the review process has been very slow.
And the debate between the dynasties and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A member of the radical left party, the French Non-surrender Party, recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the Minister of Labor on social media, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The speaker of the National Assembly finally announced that the member of parliament was banned from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social trend in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has slightly adjusted the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The trade union is ready to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th. On March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade union also plans to organize demonstrations.
China encourages raising the fertility rate to colleges and universities to urge high quality standards for sperm donation
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a publicity on the 9th to solicit sperm donations from those with a college degree or above or students in school. Successful donations of 8 to 12 times will receive a subsidy of RMB4,500.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message was hotly searched on Weibo that day, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a signed report by the Free Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
Among the sperm donation thresholds in colleges and universities around the world, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of more than 170 cm, correct facial features, no obvious hair loss, and no degree of myopia higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of andrology physical examinations worth 1,000 yuan, “especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done it before, which is of great significance to understanding their fertility status.”
The conditions for sperm donors include those who are over 165 cm tall, have a college degree or above or are studying, have no color blindness, weak color, liver B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China Tianmu News as saying that the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province printed a poster of “Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory“, calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages to ”let love pass."
The price code of Shaanxi Province is higher than that of Yunnan. Those who are qualified can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of sperm donors can receive a subsidy of RMB5,000.
At present, the highest known price tag is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last Communist prime minister of East Germany passed away today
The successor of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement from the party, “Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modro said he would help turn East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, the leaders of the Communist Party were forced to step down as protestors across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After the Soviet Union came to power, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
In March 1990, Modro announced the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election result caused him to no longer serve as prime minister.
Despite Modro's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to postpone the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modero was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal election, but did not go to jail.
It is said that these allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modro continued to serve in the German Parliament and served as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and hopes to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modro was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader of the youth fire brigade and became a member of the Nazi militia Volkssturm near the end of the conflict, which conscripted men between the ages of 16 and 60 to participate in the final war struggle.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took an anti-fascist course and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he found a job as a mechanic after returning home, and continued to study social sciences and economics, and received a doctorate.
Modro was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement. Almost all young East German people joined the movement and were promoted to the chairman of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modro became the de facto leader of East Germany and held the highest state post.
Hackers supporting protests in Iran to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution hacked the president's TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Lacey's television speech.
The president's live TV speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers appeared on the screen. Their name was “Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)”.
A voice also appeared shouting “Death to the Islamic Republic.”
According to a Reuters report today, hackers interrupted state television coverage in Iran to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. Lacey's hard-line government faces the boldest challenge from young protestors demanding their ouster, but Lacey still calls on “deceived youth” to repent so that they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
After the 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country's German police in September, nationwide protests swept across Iran.
The deadly suppression of protests by Iranian security forces is one of the most powerful challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500-year monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution, the Iranian authorities released imprisoned dissidents Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha who were on hunger strike on Friday.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty order, including some prisoners arrested in the recent anti-government protests.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protestors had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report said that 70 government security personnel were also killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protestors were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the evening of the anniversary of the Iranian revolution on Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, and people chanted “Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)”.
However, many people could also be heard shouting “Death to the dictator!" during the rally.
“And ”The death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live videos of official gatherings in various states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, domestically-made anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lacey's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan ”Death to America"-an iconic slogan at state gatherings.
The crowd also chanted “Death to Israel.”
Reuters said Adelkhah, who has been in jail since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison on national security charges in 2020.
They later put her under house arrest at home, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, “including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes."

Does the balloon incident polish American eyes more?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by The Wall Street Journal today, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials said that the above-mentioned balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and will seek more political support for strengthening the protection of U.S. technology.
The United States said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence collection and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works for the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
“This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of hardliners against China.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, “We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners.
"U.S. officials said that they have notified the governments of more than 30 countries of the above-mentioned balloon incidents, and international coordination is essential to deal with the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China in the U.S. House of Representatives may also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn may force the White House to adopt a tougher policy.
According to The Wall Street Journal, many people who advocate stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also already formulating an outbound investment review plan to examine whether there is a potential national security threat from China in U.S. overseas investment.
Analysts said the White House may face calls for a faster launch of the plan.
Earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria day and night
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked hard around the clock in the ruins of thousands of earthquake-damaged buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In the icy temperature, they often call for silence, because they desperately want to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
According to a Reuters report today, two more women were rescued a few days after surviving the ruins of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and the death toll in Syria is more than 3,500.
The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that occurred on Monday continued to have several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria. It was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years. Rescuers rescued the two women from the ruins of a collapsed building in Turkey.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast Turkey.
In the icy temperature, rescuers often call for silence because they desperately want to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete pile.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers squatted under concrete slabs and whispered “Inshallah”-“God bless”-they cautiously stretched their hands into the ruins and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes wide, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images show that the first responders also took away his mother, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people were rescued from the ruins, and a total of 31,000 rescuers were used in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were receiving treatment in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were homeless due to the earthquake and they were huddled in temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, people are increasingly questioning the response of the leaders of the two countries to disaster relief.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma went to a hospital in Aleppo. It was reported that this was the first time he had traveled to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the state of war complicating relief efforts, its stocks in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria are about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adyaman province, and he admitted that the government's response did not reach the expected speed.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote held on May 14, but may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over the delay in providing assistance and starting rescue efforts may affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as Erdogan's most serious challenge in his two decades in power.
Eldoan called for unity and condemned what he called “a negative campaign for political gain.”
Kemal Kilidaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's response.
The criticism said, “The earthquake is very big, but what is more serious than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

What exactly was the “object" that was shot down over Alaska?
Bewildered, speculations have followed
The U.S. military once again used the F-22, the most advanced stealth jet fighter in the United States, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska in the afternoon of Friday (February 10).
The location of the shooting down was ten miles from the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time the US military has shot down a flying object in the air in less than a week.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed in the sky near the coast of South Carolina after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska. It flew at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) and was about the size of a small car. It is much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that this object is maneuverable.
John Kirby, the strategic communication coordinator of the White House National Security Council, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of the object flying at high altitude is not yet clear, it “poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft.”
Kobe said that this object is different from the spy balloon found in the United States, and there is no “payload” hanging on it.
Kobe said, “We call it an ‘object’ is the best description we can currently make.”
President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down of the object. He made this decision “very cautiously,” Kobe added.
The official U.S. description of this object can be roughly summarized as: the size is equivalent to a small car, there is no joystick, no suspension device, and the flight altitude is about 10,000 meters.
But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly is this object, which country it belongs to, and what tasks it is performing.
At present, many analyses and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may be the same as the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that fluttered over Latin America. They came from China and performed certain missions in different locations.
Some people also associate this “object” in Alaska with “unidentified flying objects” (UFOs).
The U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer as saying in a tweet on Twitter on Friday, “I really hope this 'UFO’ is also a spy balloon, not a legal UFO."
“The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict,” Major said.
Major sent this tweet shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska was shot down.
Newsweek said that Major was not the only one who suspected that the object was a UFO.
Representative Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “UFOs.”
Amazon's customer service attitude makes me hard to believe
It is estimated that few people have seen this place, but I also want to talk about it a little bit.
This dress was a zipper hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short-sleeved one that was given to me in the end.
Immediately after receiving the clothes, I contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, I confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw that the product name changed to short-sleeved. The original link I bought was removed from the shelves.
Then the customer service informs that either the goods will be retained to compensate for a certain amount, or the goods will be returned.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable. It's not my problem that the clothes are wrong. As a consumer, I asked for the goods I should get. I didn't make any exaggerated requests, but Amazon changed its name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.
Incomprehensible sleeves
It is said that it is cowhide, which is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the part, and it is not clear whether it is leather. In addition, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the clothes, but usually it is only 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm long, and the arms naturally droop. It should be in the palm of the tiger's mouth, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.
But I really don't know when to refund the money?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, because the version is too small, I have to return the goods, but after the goods are returned, more than a week has passed, and I haven't received a refund yet?
And the purchaser has to contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since I bought Amazon items!
But the store is still good, and it actively cooperates to urge the courier to refund in time, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite irritating, and it takes about half a month for the refund to be made. This kind of partner has to drag Amazon's back legs, poor work efficiency, and no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
Killed in 99 seconds.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, soft/moderate thickness, and there is no smell of kerosene.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5, stretch the maximum size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg, the waist is a bit tight.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waist circumference.
In addition, it is uncomfortable to wear close-fitting.
Very good, the color is not very bright
It rose by more than two hundred as soon as I bought it. What's the situation?
For the first time, Amazon used the cooperative Tiantian Rotten express. The first delivery was not at home. Later, I took the initiative to make two delivery appointments with the courier. The courier did not deliver it. Later, he returned it directly to me. This damn courier has no integrity at all. It is strongly recommended not to use that Tiantian Rotten express anymore.
This time, another T-shirt was also returned to me, and the price increased by more than one hundred yuan for another shot.
Amazon self-operated products should not appear like this
When the product is on special offer, the price is not low, and it is also a very good product to read the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn out in a large area, and there were wear and tear in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. The picture above will be shown later.
I applied for a return. After seeing the picture, the manufacturer said it was caused by transportation. Isn't this nonsense?
How can the inside of the product be worn out?
There are only two possibilities, either defective and old products, or I deliberately damaged the goods and returned them.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I did not damage the goods, but based on my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I believe that such goods should not appear in Amazon's own products. Customers choose Amazon's own products to be trusted, customer win, we win, the victory of the customer is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and two E2s have appeared. I don't know what to do with it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often appeared with red E2. It should be that there is a problem with the transmitter module. This is not consistent with the sustainable work of the transmitter module on the Amazon website for 7 years, right? I can't find the after-sales service on the Amazon website. I don't know what's good now?
Ok
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was also broken.
And it's always a white screen.
It will be fine after the change.
The exchange is very rapid, it is a bit blurred at night, and the viewing angle is not very wide, but it is enough for ordinary households.
The disadvantage is that I don't have a card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened. This time there is no. When buying a mobile phone, there is also a sticker-like chapter that can be affixed to the warranty card. This time there is no.
I don't know if it's cheaper or not, I'm very confused.
Waiting for the supplier's reply
The package does not have any logo. I called the supplier directly and said that the answer is that it is genuine without the logo. If I suspect that the scrap can be mailed to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, I will leave the license plate number and phone number, and promise to send a text message to notify me to enter my information into the warranty card on Johnson & Johnson's official website. Haven't you received a text message yet?
I received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are still very reassuring.
The oil changer said that the oil is clear and it is indeed good oil.
Because it was the second purchase.
So I'm still very relieved.
The express delivery is fast, and the packaging is not picky. After using this oil, the sound of the engine drops significantly.
The price is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil below two hundred.
Support star crown, support winning brand, and effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan caused serious damage to the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admit mistakes, but have been prevaricating, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot restrain third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The page size options I purchased at the beginning were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought this was a trap. I called the Japanese-Asian Chinese customer service and made it clear that 8 was 8c, but when the product returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm. I think this is a completely deliberate trap to pit the Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales service), now there is no such option on the viewing page.
Chinese customer service: I'm sorry, I caused you a loss, we will give you two ways to go：
1. If you return the product, the buyer will bear all the shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the goods, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.
(Let me calculate the account. The shoes are more than 4,000 yen, which is counted as 200rmb. Choose 1. I don't have shoes and the loss is 200 yuan.
Option 2. I have shoes. In the end, I was compensated 2,000 yen. In the end, the loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I returned an email saying that I did not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service. That's it.
I proposed: When the purchase page was a confusing option like 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me talk about the fact that the commonly used codes in Japan will not bring c, similar to 140, but do you have to go to other caterpillar pages to see it?
There are both U.S. and Japanese codes with mixed labels.
Besides, why do you put 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c? Obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you are going to ship back to China, so we will not make a claim for your freight.
I don't understand this logic anymore. I'm Japanese. I also need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. Then the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese calls? It's nothing more than a Japanese amoy like me.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for these people in Haitao?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers imported from Europe. The first purchase experience was more satisfactory. The baby used one diaper all night, which can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L-size diapers. There are 2 packs in a box. After opening it, I felt that the paper was loose. There is a clear difference between the two Pampers. After using it for the baby, it's okay. There is no leakage of urine and no signs of rash.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, the baby's inner thighs immediately developed a rash after starting to use it, and it has not faded yet.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packs in 1 box is still different.
I shouldn't continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of packages
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been online shopping for so long. There are no protective measures, cushioning foam, wrapping buffer layer materials, etc., nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic boxes inside are packed, and the card boxes are pressed open until they are deformed.
I hope the quality of the authentic products is guaranteed, and I won't dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
I would rather be half as expensive in China, with a guarantee point.
Moreover, regarding the packaging of commodity products, I have seen comments from people in 2016, and it has been the same for 19 years now.
It shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is too far from domestic <url>, Tmall, etc.
It looks good, but it's a bit of a pity
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange-red. Although my family is a male treasure, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I thought, but it was originally used to take it out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed away, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close. Because the position of the straw is forward and vertical, my son always has to hold the bulge on the lid to drink water. I wonder if this place can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make sense to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments are a bit redundant to me, and I don't feel like I know what to pack.
After buying it, I found that there is another brand very similar to Meiya purchased overseas, which is less than two hundred yuan.
Fakes, fakes are very powerful
Amazon sells fakes, and I also took it.
The customer service said that it couldn't be returned because it was used. I didn't know how to know it was a fake.
Because of trust, I'm sad. After all, it's a face-wiping product. Really go to a physical store and buy it. It's more expensive.
Because it was a spike, I didn't read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
In short, tragedy.
When I used the second tablet, I chose the pores that were fine, but when I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one before, and then I couldn't stand it when I put it on my face. It was very pungent and indescribable. I coughed out immediately after I smoked, my eyes hurt, and I shed tears. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
Unbelieving evil opened another piece of the same style, it doesn't have that heavy taste anymore, and it is now being applied.
In retrospect, it smells a bit like inferior perm water in a hair salon.
I really can't imagine that Amazon's self-operated skin care products have to be avoided from now on?
Profiteer
When I bought it at that time, the event page said that the “Complete Works of the Three Bodies” would be given away for 99 yuan or more. There was no such gift when I received the goods. I called customer service and said that I wanted to show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who buys the goods and saves the screenshots of the Web page. For the activities you have done yourself, you still need customers to help you provide it. Buyers should keep an eye on it next time and save the evidence.
Feel after use
The first time I bought something on Amazon, I felt a few points separately. Let's talk about the feeling of running out of goods first. The first is indeed painless and there is no irritating taste. Overall, it is very good. Wait for about 8 minutes and wipe it off. It's just that there will be a small amount of hair residue on it. If you don't take a closer look, you can't see it, so it's generally good. As for using it once after that, you have to continue to observe and you will only know if you continue to use it.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
Second, I placed an order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th. A total of 15 days is half a month. Amazon's delivery staff has a good service attitude.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday, it will be nearly 12 yuan cheaper after waiting for 2 days. That is, I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping or something). There is a feeling of raising the price when you engage in activities.
What did the customer service say about price fluctuations? I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is like this, and the fluctuation is not large.
Affordable price, Japanese origin, with Chinese label, with particles, absolutely repurchased!
The cream has particles in it, the freshness is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much stronger than a second-hand product. It is said that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they are wholesale.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to the second-hand east again.
Give me a suggestion. Why can't I post orders on Amazon's app sometimes? I hope I can improve some applications and I will do better and better!
"Over the years, it has gotten worse and worse, and there is no quality of service at all!
Garbage, regardless of customer needs, when placing an order, the special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to be in bed after surgery at home, it is only convenient to receive them at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon without calling in advance.
If the delivery time is what your courier wants to deliver as soon as he wants, why bother to pretend to get a time for the customer to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then don't be an e-commerce company at all!
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier, and he has to find change to pay!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!
Zhuoyue's so-called complaint customer service is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I also encountered a similar problem with the wrong delivery time before, so I endured it, but this time I couldn't bear it, it was too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and back cover were reversed. This was an obvious quality problem. Did you close your eyes and send the book to the customer?
No one will contact you if you leave a bad review.
"Over the years, it has gotten worse and worse, and there is no quality of service at all!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
The picture quality is really unacceptable
As the title of "Ancient Atlas”, this book is really unacceptable in the selection, layout, and printing of pictures. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are too blurred to be recognized.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the medieval literature left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from related industry resources with clear original documents). What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
！I regret this kind of academic spirit.
There is no evaluation in terms of writing, and the Fang family has their own differences.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book in my sophomore year of high school. At that time, I was just holding the mentality of being bored and playing. I felt that I shouldn't be addicted to such a book. After all, my online articles were still not very attractive to me in the past.
then...It fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and enjoyable. When Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if it was a conspiracy between guilds, it was not heavy at all because it was often bloody by Ye Shen. .
As for the part of the game, I wrote a little bit of sadness about the changes of the times, the exchange of old and new (maybe it's my sentimentality).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of the characters and emotional lines is very amazing. Some characters are only brought occasionally, and they will leave a deep impact on people. For example, the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, Su Mucheng have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the center of the writing, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc., are also very popular. In an e-sports article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is the success of full-time character writing.
On the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million harem beauties that are criticized by ordinary online articles. They are either beautiful or corrupt. The common thing about all people's feelings is that they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win in a dignified manner.
There are small calculations but there is no big conspiracy. Everyone looks so simple and cute.
This may be why there are no annoying roles full-time.
The full-time IP is very large, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, this is a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood and a little touch.
It will be animated full-time in April this year.
In fact, I have wanted to buy this set of books for a long time. Because my wallet is not thick enough, I didn't bother to do it. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on the market. In fact, I recently published another version. I like the cover picture. , But I still plan to buy the old version first, so I took a look at it on Amazon and bought a set at once.
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●There is no plastic seal for the fourth book, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth plastic seal was opened in China, and the texture of the book is also very strange. It feels no harder than the others.
●The 23rd book is the same as the seventeenth book, but it is harder than the seventeenth book, but it is very old.
●The publishing houses of individual books are different. It seems that the 23rd and 17th are the same publishing house, which is different from the others.
●Overall, it is quite satisfactory, 24 large boxes, very satisfied.
Lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but there were still a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the children, a little lion who can shoot, and a little lion who loves fruit juice and candy.
When I saw the episode of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Seeing the end, this little lion who has succeeded in human society has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete human being.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I didn't know where he had gone.
It may be many years later that the image of this little lion will still be in the impression of the grown-up children, and it may be remembered inadvertently one day, which may touch or inspire her.
A very cost-effective portfolio
1. I DIDN'T KNOW TASCHEN BEFORE. I BOUGHT A LOT OF THEIR BOOKS RECENTLY. The REASON IS THAT IT IS TOO POWERFUL, WHETHER IT IS THE TOPIC SELECTION OR THE PRODUCTION ITSELF.
There have been three versions of this work. The largest version, like the complete works of Michelangelo, is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it is equipped with a book box of two book editions.
Personally, I think it's acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and the more than 700 pages are divided into two books, which are better to read as a paperback; second, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, the paintings account for the main body, and Leonardo Da Vinci's black and white manuscript accounts for most of it. For non-art professional readers with a limited budget, this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great. There are composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it is the printing or the size of the book. Some of the shaded parts are too deep to see the details clearly. It's a pity.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter is so extensive and accomplished that it is not enough to describe as a genius.
If you only looked at the paintings before and could only experience half of Leonardo Da Vinci, you would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.
Garbage, whoever buys it regrets it!
I never give bad reviews. This is really rubbish. It's a waste of money to buy it. Give me a reason!
1.The time to leave was not allowed, and it suddenly became January 1st, and the time returned to zero.
2.The inferior belts are not silicone, and the wrists are allergic and blistering.
3.Often can't connect to the phone.
4.The battery life is only five days.
5.The sleep test does not show, the time is 0.
6.Not waterproof.
7.other.
Logistics is too slow
It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but the result was only received on the 21st. Bad review!
The express delivery is too bad, and shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning. This time it was okay. There is an inflatable bag inside. The camera has the same three yards. It can also be registered on the official website. The number of shutters is 0. The rest can only wait for time to check.
The delivery speed is quite fast. I'm here to complain about the courier brother. The valuable items are placed in the concierge and they are leaving quickly. I can't open the box in front of him for inspection. I'm really speechless about this.
The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping:)
The merchant is more responsible, and he specifically called to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is indeed for the sake of the customer.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also very suitable and useful to stick to.
Dissatisfied with battery charging
The machine is really good. I want to ask why it has not been charged since the first time it was charged. The charging indicator light has been red.
Currently, Amazon's official feedback channel cannot be found, so it can only be fed back in the product evaluation.
1. On March 29th, I used 31 yuan to purchase the book through the pre-order channel, which showed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31st. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website (because it has not yet been released)；
2. The content of the book pushed to the device on March 31st is blank, so stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan.；
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again. I have been unable to obtain the electronic version of "The Nature of Business" containing the actual content, but I can already preview the book on Amazon's official website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The issue of price is actually not the most important. The key is how to replace blank books on kindle with books with actual content, rather than downloading them forever“ "Stay tuned”
2. The pre-ordered book should not be bought again in the future. After all, in case the ticket is skipped and another book with empty content is downloaded, the procedures seem very complicated.；
3. I hope Amazon will give a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When you have doubts about the download or use of e-books, you can have local feedback (work orders and online customer service are available, you can refer to the official Microsoft store how to do it)
Not very recommended to read
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it. Write some post-reading feelings based on memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments of love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, the kind of plain water-like plainness, the pursuit of simplicity in sentence-making to the extreme, and the plot is as silent and plain as the street on a summer afternoon.
Every short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.
Finally collected together, the title is "What are we talking about when we talk about Love".
I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not just the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea in urban legends is dry and rocky, and it is not just you and me. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above, love is also a dull life, boring day after day, there is also a loss of life, an escape from reality, and a loss of the future.
When reading this book, you may recall in your mind the quarreling couple next to you, the boring marriage of someone you know, and the unhappy feelings.
This is why I don't recommend reading. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are boring. Unless your life is stormy or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you have to read it. The feeling is not surprising and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily plot does not brighten people's eyes or expand a person's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes caused the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
Suitable for rough reading, not a closer look.
The logic of this book is very good, but the content is not full enough.
It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is very weak in terms of what to do. It only points out the direction but does not give specific practices.
In addition, this book feels like it is pieced together.
For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and well-known and unknown people.
I don't know if it is a story compiled for example. It would be more convincing to cite some cases experienced by the author.
The title of customer or customer has changed.
The title is still the customer, and the text becomes the customer.
There are also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.
In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick guide to Internet Finance
This book is very shallow. It can be said that it is just an introductory course. It can help everyone quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to gain an in-depth understanding, you still have to follow the map and dig deep by yourself.
Moreover, the book was written earlier, and the content of the later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. I am afraid that the share of third-party payment is no longer as small as the proportion mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned Unionpay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write tall and empty, but the difficulty is that it's easy to understand.
I appreciate you and want you to know more!
The first element that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he has received enough attention and appreciation at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchical theory of needs, after people's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent thing is the satisfaction of psychological needs-the hope of being understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are “it's hard to open your heart to love you”, even if you have love, gratitude and appreciation, you will not say it silently in your heart.
In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: affirmative words, careful moments, acts of service, satisfactory gifts, and physical contact.
I think it is important not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the bottom of your heart anytime, anywhere to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the more intimate people are, the more they need to be appreciated and grateful, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate that companies can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.
Due to the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thank you again for the hard work of the authors, translators and editors!
Suspected of being counterfeit goods, please strictly review by Amazon
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is not even as good as the products at roadside stalls. There is no gram weight, no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose and is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon and has been applied for a return; it is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants polish their eyes and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: I bought another heart seal, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added a few comparative photos to further verify the product's shoddy and shoddy, in order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further unhappiness!
I once again expect Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
So-so products, there is a gap with expectations
advantages：
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The MOTOR AND BLADE ARE GUARANTEED BY PANASONIC, AND IT IS OK TO USE, BUT THERE IS A GAP WITH MY EXPECTATIONS.
Disadvantages：
1. THERE IS NO INDICATOR LIGHT FOR CHARGING. THE MOST BASIC POWER INDICATION FOR YOU HAS BEEN SAVED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE 300 YUAN PRODUCTS ARE ALSO ALMS AND DISRESPECT IN THE EYES OF PANASONIC.
2. There is a strong odor when charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.
The office tried it for one day, and the whole room smelled of plastic.
Compared with the PHILIPS PHILIPS of the same price I have used before, although there is an extra cutter head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.
Small package
As soon as I received the express delivery, I saw that the e-commerce version was written on it, and I knew that it had fallen into the pit again. It was much smaller than the one bought in the supermarket. It should be M. It is different from the picture packaging on the product introduction. The so-called new version.
The three stars are to blame for being sloppy and not seeing the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-code e-commerce version. What does it mean that your goods are not in the right version?
E-commerce has a deep routine, so I went to the supermarket to buy it when I had time.
Just sauce purple.
I don't like the taste
Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much. They say it's spicy every time. Maybe it's more appropriate to use other words to describe it. This is the only word in the child's thesaurus for the time being.
I bought it when I was engaged in activities, it was very cheap, so I'm sorry to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it anymore.
Genuine yo, well packaged
The packaging is very complete, with an inflatable bag added inside, and there are no online reviews, only the appearance of a bare product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it will come the next day after the photo is taken.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, so I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.
A terrible shopping experience
The order was placed during the Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and didn't receive it. When I inquired later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and said that they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but said that the sender could initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the express delivery was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and after several turnover, the express delivery was finally retrieved. The outer packaging has been disassembled, and the goods are still complete. I don't know if they have been used. In short, it's very sad.
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive a headset like Figure 2. Even if the picture is inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound on the left and right of the headset is different in size?
Although the names are all the same, I still hope everyone can pay careful attention. In addition, the person in charge of Amazon is requested to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.
The operating system is normal
After using it for a while, the overall picture is OK, and there is no difference in feeling. That is, this system makes people look tangled. The boot time is obviously a bit slow, and it can't be set up well. There is no need to comment on the software you bring, and the response speed is more general. Compared with colleagues, it is not an order of magnitude.
Looking at the comments, I said that it is a very user-friendly design. I didn't find any user-friendly design. The position of the return button design of the remote control, which is commonly used up and down, is really not flattering.
So, just use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.
The price reduction is too great
The price reduction is too great, more than one hundred yuan is now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of un-evaluated orders on Amazon, so I uniformly use the copied passage as the evaluation content.
If I use this passage to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For relatively poor products, I will never be lazy to copy and paste the evaluation, so that other consumers will use it as a reference when buying, and merchants will improve the quality of the products as a result.
The low price is good, it's enough if you don't have a fever!
Such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard. I personally compared the domestic Akihabara shit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and relatively soft, and there is no noise in the 7-meter transmission. In the future, I will look for the low-cost line. Think about it!
Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, it was found that the order was wrong, but the cancellation of the order could not be cancelled. The online customer service on the webpage kept showing the wrong link and could not be contacted.
After the arrival, the deliveryman called me and I said I didn't want it anymore. If I wanted to cancel the order, the deliveryman took it back and said to sign for it first and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was told that once the food category was signed for, it could not be returned, and there was no way to call Amazon customer service. The same is true, it cannot be returned after signing for it.
I have bought items that cannot be returned under the policy in both Jingdong and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and they were all returned when I contacted customer service, and the taste of Jingdong's diapers was too strong after opening. Contact customer service to return it, but it won't work if you arrive at Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me that I will either accept it by myself or let the courier buy it by myself. It is not easy for the courier to pay for it. Why should I let others pay for things that are not purchased by myself?
Okay, I won't refund it either. I accepted it myself, but I have to give your service 1 point.
Advise everyone not to spend money in vain
First of all, I'm looking forward to buying it. I don't think the Dole brand should be much worse. After receiving it, I look at the packaging and think it's okay. The head is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft and can't be seen from the outside. You have to feel it. It has no taste at all when you eat it. It's dull and tasteless. The flesh is dark yellow when you bite it. It's the kind that's broken. It's mixed. If you sell it, you can eat less than one-third of it. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap. The quality is too poor!
Learn a lesson and learn a wisdom, and never buy fruits in e-commerce again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark of the product?
The corner of the bottom of the bottle is severely depressed. It should have been caused by a strong impact. From the perspective of the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is worrying. After all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still purchased internationally. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs. It's very easy to open the bottle. The key is that the layer of honey inside the lid comes out directly from the inside, and there is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are foreign products like this?
I was born in China and I don't understand it anymore.
It should be genuine, right?
There is also a reminder to arrive on the 20th when the photo is taken. This one was received on the 14th. I bought it overseas here for the first time. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?
Pick-up service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons. When I picked them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 copies for the first time, but only 2 copies were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that they were missed and need to be reissued after agreeing; the second appointment was just in time for the rest day, and the website and WeChat did not prompt the need to make an appointment on working days, which caused unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.
Nice shopping
Things are well received!
I still believe in Amazon's self-operated things. Now it is very convenient to buy overseas. The logistics time to buy back from abroad is only a few days longer than in China. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance ability from overseas to China is still very strong, and it is much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better. Many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than in China. I hope to improve.
rubbish
Seeing such a package, I asked everyone: Do you think it is garbage on the side of the road?
For a fragile plastic package, a plastic bag is used to send it from the so-called Germany. Is such a package responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is the same as garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was very simple and there was no measure to prevent damage. It was packed in a simple plastic bag. After I got it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were also damaged.
If I just come across one like this, I recognize it, and I bought a few like this. If I find Amazon customer service, the customer service will say that it can be refunded, but the shipping fee will be paid in advance, and then the shipping fee will be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, I use cash to pay for the freight, and you give me a gift card. If you want me to buy your gift card by myself, just say it, and you have to mail the product to the German warehouse by yourself. This is not a crime to buy a product!
And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, and they dare not even take half of the responsibility. What is the guarantee for such after-sales service? In one sentence: admit it!But I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish my evaluation, so I will delete it directly!
The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics is very poor
1. The quality is very good, the spike is good, the price is moderate, and the value for money is excellent.
2. Strong, sufficient materials are used, the solder joints are firm, the surface treatment is proper, and the color is very good.
3. The logistics is a mishap. The order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon does not indicate that the estimated arrival time is February 7th, I might be very satisfied.
5. However, the expected arrival time is marked, which is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure of giving a promise, please do not make a promise.
7. In fact, I care very much about the promises made by merchants.
8. So, I got a low score.
The gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether it feels obvious depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not very good is the golden thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the golden thread will fade. Put it on the car. If you hold it a few times, there will be some gold powder in your hands and on the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square one has no decorative effect, so don't get on the gold line. It's troublesome to get dirty on the car when it falls off.
The things are in good condition, the speed is ok, divided into 2 packages and packaged differently
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the 2 pieces are divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is still different. Obviously, one is too shockproof. The thick cardboard is attached, and the outer packaging is sealed with a layer of plastic. It is also easy to disassemble. One is like a domestic express box. Just put a few cushioning airbags. It feels a bit perfunctory.
Yalan mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is not generally thick, so you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, and the sleep is very comfortable. I fell asleep quickly when I lay on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to violent courier transportation. Yalan customer service was very responsible and contacted very efficiently to solve the problem.
It's not a self-operated commodity, Amazon is shameless
The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for after-sales. If you have any questions, please contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange the goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.
What kind of self-operated commodity is this Nima?
The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon is not responsible for after-sales. The customer service actually said “I will contact the supplier for you”, and claimed that it was self-operated. It's shameless, shameless, and naked fraud on consumers!
Depressed experience
The filter element that was purchased online in another store before has a good filtration effect, and it will be the same without scale if you use it for one or two more days after the end of 28 days.
Since the quality of the things I have always purchased on Amazon is good, I just wanted to buy it here this time. The first time I bought the filter element on Amazon, it didn't feel very good. Not only did it start to have dirt early, but the filter element was used until the 28th day. There will be suspended black toner. I really don't know if I will continue to use it or just throw it away. I'm very depressed~
Not as good as imagined
Compared with the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is general, and the internal workmanship is not disassembled. I hope that as described by the store, from the point of view of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered on is missing.
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is more seriously damaged. The packaging box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new. It was only renovated in September. It is in stock. I hope it will not be broken by then. Please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you can handle it safely, thank you!
Overall good, a bit of a problem
The FIRST time I BOUGHT a filter kettle, I READ a few EVALUATION ARTICLES and FELT that LAICA was more cost-effective. I CHOSE THIS one. After receiving the goods, I INSTALLED the FILTER element according TO the INSTRUCTIONS and TRIED IT out. It FEELS GENERALLY good, BUT WHEN pouring water, IT SEEMS THAT the raw WATER WILL BE MIXED WITH THE TREATED WATER FROM THE SPOUT (THE original water warehouse is not tightly sealed).
When using it, be sure to wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
Incomplete picture
The picture does not show the details on the side. The details on the side are not consistent with the style of the subject. There is a big difference. This is one of them; this bead is made in Thailand, and the place of origin is not indicated. This is the second; the texture is not indicated. This is the third; when I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There is only a simple plastic bag here, and there is no product logo on the bead. Where can I judge whether it is true or not.
Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
The order placed two days ago was found to be down by 40 yuan when I received it today. It took a lot of time to find customer service. The customer service said that it could not make up the difference. You can buy it again and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure and a certain east.
Okay, as a novice, it's worth starting
The quality is good, and it is no match for the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, let alone hundreds. This is the first time I have played King Kong. It's okay.
Nice stuff
The things are really good, for my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not in Canada for express delivery at noon. The logistics company put it directly in the mail storage treasure and did not send me a verification text message for pickup, which caused me to run twice.
But the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and the Amazon discount is really strong. Zhou Shengsheng's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. It's so fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.

A customer's confession
1 After receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle, you contact the customer service staff, and they will tell you that the problem will be dealt with by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You will never be able to contact this commissioner on your own initiative, you don't know her work number, and you don't have a direct contact number, that is, you can't contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, this commissioner contacted me. My phone left for a while and I did not receive a call from this commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours and didn't wait for the specialist's call. During this period, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and emailed customer service to ask her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed, and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the coffee machine that I received this defective product!
5There is no problem with Amazon products in the United States. This shopping method is good for overseas purchases, but it is far worse than Meiya's service.
6 For me, I can only continue to wait...
Uneven bottom
Because the reviews are very good, everyone is looking forward to this pot, and they like it very much when they get it. It is very light, but when they open the pot, they find a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrudes, the periphery is concave, and the oil runs to the periphery. The specially bought big fat meat fried out a lot of oil. It can't cover the central area. If it is pasted, the pot can't be opened. It is estimated that this structure will not be able to cook vegetables normally.
I don't know if I was out of luck. I just got a pot with an uneven foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provided a one-month return service and returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot cleanly and returned it, and I was busy for a long time in vain.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer processed the top into a slight arc.
It should have been very smooth lines.
It is a pity that the final effect has not been achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the top cover of the water box.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and after flattening, there is a height difference of up to about 2mm.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the entire sense of design has been destroyed.
I feel a little bit sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating products of this level.
(Of course, you can't ask too much for the feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all the individuals of this product are like this, and it's not just the one I bought that has a problem, her disapproval and overwhelmed emotions made me understand that I can't ask too much for the beautiful one.) 2019-7-7 The water pump failed and the water output was low. It has been repaired for the second time, and it broke down two weeks after the first repair.
It's a good deal after the discount, Amazon's fake discount is very sad
Purchased one week after the baby is born, the insulation is super strong.
There is not a trace of heat on the outside of the pot, which can effectively protect the temperature from spreading even if it is not afraid of being scalded.
After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a very high temperature.
Amazon said that there are 320 big discounts for the anniversary event. Later, it was discovered that everyone has 249,289,299. There is a sense of being deceived in an instant, but going to the supermarket to compare it is still much more cost-effective than various miscellaneous brands at the same price. You can carry it with you when you go out in the future.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting and watching for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 was discounted, and I bought the same price from overseas, so I hurriedly started.
The order was placed on September 2nd, and the expected arrival was on the 21st. As a result, it arrived on the 12th. It was almost 10 days in advance. The speed is really fast!
The packaging box is not large, and the original packaging of Vitamix is directly used. Amazon is not afraid of breaking it across the ocean!
The machine looks very new and has complete accessories, but the cup is shaking so badly on the base that I am afraid to turn on the cup and fly out directly!
I asked a friend with 5200, and he seemed to be not as loose as mine when he heard his description.
The randomly included recipes are all in English. I'm tired of reading them. I didn't find the Chinese version on the Internet. This is a trouble!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. It is estimated that it will arrive in 3 days. Then I will toss it well!
It's too small, there is no umbrella cover, and the material is general.
It's not a large size at all!
The second Totes, 1.This one does not have an umbrella cover 2.The material of the umbrella handle is generally 3.Obviously writing Large, it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and it is estimated that it is enough for two people to use it.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel good
The first is that the box is not very strong, and it is deformed with a single click. The second is that the ABS designed on the back prevents the surface of the box from scratching and does not work when it is placed flat. Again, the inside of the box is wrapped in a piece of cloth, and the place of the tie rod is highlighted..Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a bit not smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
Ok
Advantages: This backpack is more exquisite and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), and the 15.6-inch notebook can't be put away (a little longer is okay). The zipper of this backpack can be locked, but it does not prepare a lock for the buyer, which cannot be said to be service-oriented.
The whole is okay, I don't know if it's genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, if you don't know if it is genuine leather, you can't evaluate it blindly.
It can hold documents in A4 format, which are over 80 pages thick, but box-like objects that are too thick and too hard (those that cannot be deformed) are estimated to not be able to hold them.
The bag is very soft, and the separation of the inner pockets is more user-friendly, which is still quite good.
It's just that there is a small sand eye at the bottom of the one I got. I don't know if it's my bad character or not?
I didn't bother to toss and exchange the goods, so I endured it.
A four-star rating as a whole is still worth it.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world, camera strap, SLR strap
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging on the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected by soft materials. It is not like other fast-moving guns that use screws to fix the bottom of the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after-sales
The qin I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, I gave me an after-sales call. After many communications, the parts have not been received yet. What is the efficiency? !
It is estimated that there will be problems in the future and maintenance will be more troublesome. Friends who are looking forward to the after-sales service should take a detour. It's too much trouble!
There are minor defects, the tone is good
The Qin head is defective, one corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is already good, and the tone of the qin is also good.
Okay, the first face order
After using it for a long time, except that the bass can't come out, it's generally not bad.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I bought it for the first time, there was a problem with something, all the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.
I asked for an exchange, but it turned out that the goods had been in Shanghai for three days and had not been delivered yet.
I didn't answer the call to the delivery person.
The courier company said that they only have that contact information.
Amazon could not find a place to complain.
I haven't asked for it. If the delivery is delayed, the delivery will be delayed inexplicably according to my request－such a text message will come.
What transit issues will be mentioned later.
Anyway, the extremely poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
It is estimated that I will not get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; and the label is very sticky, it is not good for the cable label at all, and it is very easy to fall off. Friends who bought it to organize the cable need to pay attention.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a paper box, there are no protective measures, and the box containing the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the torn glue is all on the box.
The six hundred yuan thing was treated like this, and I was very disappointed in a shopping trip.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve the packaging in the future!
If the quality is not good, if you talk about writing, it's better to 925-25
First praise the daily express delivery, air parts, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, which is great. I just received 925-85. The quality of the pen is not good, and the style is also very beautiful. The reason why I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The cap is a bit shaky when adjusting the length of the lead core. Personal opinion: 925-25 is more convenient than 85.
So I became a diehard Amazon fan
I bought it at a super favorable price, but the child didn't like to click on the reading pen.
It has been unopened, I tried to apply for a return, but I actually picked it up for free.
Awesome.
Returns are not advocated, but this kind of service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
In the future, all the books have been transferred to buy here.
The headphones are biased, and there is noise
This headset is really rubbish. I don't know if there is a problem with my ears, or if this headset is really not as good as before.
I bought a blue one in a certain store two years ago. The sound quality is not bad. There is no noise and the bass is not bad. After using it for two years, I plan to buy another one (urbeats). After all, it feels pretty good.
I saw a purple one again, which is very beautiful, but I bought this one and opened it today. I didn't feel right until I opened it. The voice was loud and the voice was low.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effect of that song. I didn't think much about it, but then after listening to it for a long time, I realized that the problem was very serious. Not only was the pitch biased, but the bass effect didn't sound as good as the one I had before, and there was a little noise. Is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon?Or is the headphone manufacturing process really not working now?
Quite a poor evaluation, very disappointed.
Be sure to return it during the day tomorrow.
PS has a good face value
This AV power amplifier has complex settings, rough appearance and workmanship, and large heat generation.
It will take a while to comment on the sound!
I just started the German version of DN1080 on August 14th.At first glance, the workmanship is so poor.
1.The front panel and knobs are all plastic.
2.The audio input socket of the rear board and the speaker output terminal are all so bad, just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine is much better than this one.
3.The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer is still concave. I had to open the box and restore it by hand. The combination of the top cover and the front panel was loose.
4.The center of gravity of the entire machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like it's SONY's entry-level machine, just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
It feels that Sony is much better than Pony to be OEM in China.
5.The machine has a lot of heat, and the top cover of the two channels used to watch a movie for about 2 hours has to be 40-50℃ when touched by hand. I don't know if the transformer is too hot.
Now it is used for switching power supplies, and this silly transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony should use a silent fan that actively dissipates heat in the machine. After opening the box, only the large aluminum plate heat sink on the tube can be seen.

Never opened
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's in its stomach.
Think about it later, if you are disappointed after disassembling it, it would be too unfair to spend so much money; if you are satisfied after disassembling it, it will be difficult to install it again, and you will be unhappy when you use it.
Forget it, even if Sony uses a good battery.
As for the detailed description of the battery, most people will feel guilty when they look at it.
I'm okay. I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not knowing the circuit, I'm also a half-battery engineer and can withstand it.
Overjoyed
I really didn't have a bottom in my heart before I bought it, until I opened it and looked at the package, I felt very positive!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, I felt very flexible and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug in the phone to turn on qq music.
I was shocked, the sound quality turned out to be surround 3D stereo!
I asked in the physical communication store, it's about the same as 30, but it's by no means a Pinsheng brand, it's a miscellaneous brand, so although this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, the price is definitely worth it!
Worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28th, the system showed that the goods had been shipped, but the goods were not received until October 12th.
To check the status of the Amazon order, the seller did not provide the courier number, and could not find out where the order was.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if I could provide the courier number, but there was no reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service. The customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, and I called the store again. After calling a few times, the phone rang and I was told that the courier was lost. You can resend me one immediately.
Although I was very angry, because the computer was urgently needed, I didn't tell the seller much, just send it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day and asked, Has it been shipped?
The seller said it hasn't been yet, and it won't be released until the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask, and the seller said that it would be shipped after five or six o'clock in the afternoon, but when I called at seven o'clock in the evening, no one answered the call.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hadn't been sent, and told me that if I was in a hurry, let me place an order from another house, and if I could wait, it would be sent in the afternoon.
There is no way, it will take a long time to place an order from another home.
You can only ask the seller to ship the goods quickly.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for others, so let's add comments later.
I just bought it for half a year and didn't use it several times. Now I have poor contact. Can I fix it?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it a few times after buying it.
It's just a few times to bring it in the fashion bag for business trips.
Recently, it was discovered that when the power is turned on, it is not charged. You need to hold the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hand to charge it.
I suspect it is poor contact at the interface. I don't know if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon disable EMS!
Five stars for commodities, one star for logistics, and an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS. It is recognized in the industry as unreliable. Well, computers are valuables anyway!
After buying, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send it from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. As a result, when I did not receive any phone calls or text messages in the evening, I checked the logistics and was signed for it at noon. It also showed that I signed for it!
I was shocked in an instant!
Who am I?Where am i?Did I really buy this computer?
I just doubt life, okay!
Finally, I ran to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two order numbers, but fortunately, it's okay if the piece is not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to send express delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I just bought it for a few days and found that the price has been reduced. Bad reviews, this is pretty good, cost-effective, the cpu and graphics card are enough to cope with mainstream online games and a considerable number of large stand-alone machines. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light-leaking (a common problem with IPS screens), the audio quality is not very good, and the hard disk is not good (It is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state). Yesterday, I took it to the after-sales inspection and checked the hardware. There is no problem. The built-in win8.1 is not very useful. It is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller shipped quickly, and the various inquiries were answered quickly. The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer. It's a pity. There are no gifts.
(By the way, don't go to a store called E Cool Digital Center to buy keyboard film. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there is a problem with the product, it will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is still full of swearing, so I will expose it in particular)
Things are very good, but the platform bureaucracy is still there
The quality of the hard drive is very good, the price is absolutely high, and it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate logistics, it is definitely recommended to buy it.
But what I have to say is that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. It has not improved from when I vowed to never use it a few years ago. You will never find out the actual logistics situation. The information will always be delivered in a few weeks. You can never complain. It's just that bureaucratic!
It's been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days later. You will receive the goods!
Worry-free logistics
When it was delivered like this, not only was the packaging flattened, but the electrical packaging was also opened, and I don't know if there was any transfer.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet. I have always trusted Philips and hope that the battery life will be longer than other brands.
I checked the Internet, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in cling film and continue to use it. I wonder how long it will last?
I bought it that someone else took apart.
A machine with more than 300 requires more than 100 taxes. It is indeed relatively high, but now it is more than 600. The balance is much higher.
When I received it, the state of the sealing tape looked very wrong. It seemed that it had been disassembled. I hurriedly took a picture first. Sure enough, it opened as soon as it was torn. After opening it, the cardboard inside was still damaged. I was worried that someone else had returned it. Before the anniversary, I hurriedly tried it for my husband first. As a result, the machine had no electricity at all. Fortunately, there was no scum in the blade. How could I return it all the way?
It is unknown whether it will work or whether there will be any problems in the short term. As mentioned in the previous evaluation, the things sent out when they are out of stock are indeed unreliable!
The sense of experience is mid-to-upper level
It's almost top-of-the-line electric. There are many modes of tooth cleaning, but few people will change to different modes of brushing every day.
After using it for half a year, there was no problem. I brushed it every day, almost once a week.
Brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Except for changing the color, other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?
I hope to learn Dafa.
Very cost-effective
It has been used 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very simple to use and easy to clean.
3. You can do a DIY haircut and save money.
In summary, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
Last time I bought two packs, they were actually two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one pack was not. It was white. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't be sure whether Amazon's source is fake, or it was swapped by an employee when it was shipped.
I will buy it again. If it is still a fake, I will seek accountability from your relevant people.
It's horizontal!
There is a slash on the Amazon picture, but the result is sent to me with a horizontal bar. Isn't this a lie?
The effect is ok
Cats like to eat, this is the point.
It does have an effect.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind instep.
Not recommended.
1.UN is clarks' most comfortable series, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Added: Today, I compared the previous UN series insoles (the shoes were thrown away and the pads were kept for use). The material is a lot worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is fake and soft.
2.My instep is not high, and the part of my ankle is about 3 centimeters forward at the highest point of the instep.
3.Three pairs of clarks were purchased overseas, only one pair is suitable.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my favorites.
Try rockport later, if you can't, you can only go to the ecco physical store.
Shoddy, bad quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime's overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful, and the order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger, with a length of 25 feet and a width of 10.5 and a width of 7.5W, and the upper feet are a little looser, but I usually like to wear a looser one, and a pair of insoles is just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. The rubber on one sole is damaged, and the other upper has various scratches and a needle eye. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced, which is obviously shoddy!
A little regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan for the activity. It is quite cost-effective to buy Asics at this price. Of course, there is a lower price depending on the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, very comfortable to run, and they are more suitable, and they will not be loose.
The appearance value is very high, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes. The 40.5 I bought this time is about 1 thumb away from the front end of the shoes, but this does not affect anything.
These shoes are very "narrow”, although there is still a distance in front, they feel tight.
Another point is that the ventilation of the shoes may not be very good, and it feels very hot to wear them now.
Presser instep
First of all, the shoes work very well and are worth the price.
My feet are very standard. Running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's Aibu has also bought a few pairs, and there have never been any non-conforming feet, but I refer to the comments for this pair. I bought a larger size uk7. After I got on the feet, the length was obviously too long because of the size. , But because the insole is too thick, the back pressure of the foot is still severe, and the hiking shoes are very hard, which makes the upper feet very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you must buy it, changing to an insole can also solve it, but the original insole looks very advanced, so it's a pity not to need it.
A perfect shopping trip!
I am very satisfied and like it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon's overseas purchases are genuine. The quality is also very good, the quality is low, and the purchase is assured. The after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very kind and kind, the handling of problems is patient and efficient, and the worries are perfectly solved. The supporting express delivery to the door is very convenient and safe. The delivery master is very considerate of customers. He will remind them to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time every time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family likes to shop overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I was really speechless to this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to vomit.
I bought it in a spike in winter, less than 200, and it's useless to put it at home for a few months.
When I was about to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't be connected to the bracelet. The manuals of the two devices expressed their support for each other. Later, it was found that it should be a problem with the heart rate band, because other devices still couldn't be connected.
Call Amazon and ask me to contact the agency company, and the agency company asks me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back intact, and even the courier box was the one I used when I sent it!
There are no replies, receipts, and test reports!
At least tell me, is it good or bad?
I called to ask, and said that sending it back in this way means that the equipment is fine, and it is good.
But why can't I connect? The agency company replied: Then it's not their business.
I'm unlucky, I don't bother to be tossed by you for something of 200 yuan.
Seriously, the goods are not on the board.
The goods are very wrong.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than nike.
The breathability is also very good.
It's just the hat in front.
Very fine.
Are you here to tease?！
It can't cover the sun at all.
It is not returned because it functions well as a headband.
Although it can't cover the sun when worn upwards.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Keep it for use.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the deliveryman is very good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's regulations cannot deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
It caused me to drive 200 kilometers from outside the country to come back to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The deliveryman is very active and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
The product, after a brief try, is not bad.
But I haven't bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size logistics
The workmanship is okay, but the logistics is too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL. This time Apex is really...I HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF UA IN CHINA, AND THE PRICE IS NOT LOW. Do YOU FEEL THAT IT IS HIGHER THAN NIKE ADIDAS?
In fact, it's all the same, so Haitao.
Size: I am 176CM tall and 68KG. My shoulder width is generally 180. I bought M with a slightly longer hem. The others are just right. I think there is a recommended S size. Is the figure so slender?Still like tight-fitting?I think the hoodie is better to be loose.
Just the right size
With a bust of 99, a height of 184, and a weight of 84 kg, I consulted customer service before buying and was told that I should buy xxl's. Then I read the comments and decisively started with L's. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost pitted.
The price of Double Eleven is much more expensive than the Black Five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The problem of Z affordable goods is very troublesome!
The order placed on the 18th, the goods received on the 25th, the snail speed from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought a Z affordable product. The description stated that there were scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child was unwilling to return the goods, thinking that the problem was not big, but the small parts such as accessories, the child's grandfather ran to several nearby hardware stores and did not buy them!
In the end, Grandpa glued it on!
It seems that you can't buy Z affordable goods in the future!
The quality of toy processing is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, and the bolts are very strenuous. It can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it is something promised to the child, and it will not be returned.
Other comments said that the installation is not strenuous. Is it only the one I bought that has a problem?
Very general
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is too old; the workmanship is very general; there is only one kind of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then it keeps repeating; the action is to shake your head and walk forward without any change.
It's not worth the price.
If you use it urgently, you will not return it.
The quality of the toys is good, let's talk about the packaging
I received the express delivery yesterday. I bought it from Amazon. It was marked as EMS delivery. In the end, it was delivered by Tmall express. How many turns did this take?The relationship between Amazon and Tmall is not bad?
Let's talk about the packaging, it is wrapped in several layers of cling film, and there is not even a packaging plastic bubble paper in it. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy is of good quality and there are no broken parts. It is much smaller than imagined, because it is not with a battery, and it is often derailed by pushing it by hand. It feels that the gap on both sides of the track is too large and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality and fun
It's very fun, the components are very accurate, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The assembly process is very interesting, I will fight, and my 5-year-old son will play, which is very good.
He laughed and laughed again and again~ he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, Haitao is good
I took a look at Christmas. The one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but now the delivery is slower.
The machines are still good, they are all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect the elf ball, it will send a dream.
It's not bad to play, it's more portable than ps4.
I have already bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Producing rotten goods and selling rotten goods, as a result of the rotten goods service, I bought six watches for my children. One of the numbers showed incomplete, and the time of the six pieces was inconsistent, with a difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a check time for the watch in the warehouse?They replied "yes”. Since there is, why is the time difference so much? It must be that the watch has no accuracy. Simply put, it is a parallel product. It's not that I said it's bad. Look, it's obvious that the quality problems (the digital display is incomplete) are all sold out. Is it junk?
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and complained that they shouldn't have bought their things in the first place. With such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I suggest not to buy things from this seller, it is also rubbish to buy.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, the inspection found that：
1. The table packaging is seriously dilapidated.
2. The table manual has serious folds in use.
3. The watch does not leave, and the table lamp is not charged or used, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only mail it to the United States at your own expense, and then make up the postage.
5. The reason for 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
It can only be said that it is reasonable
The time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day, and it has only taken a few months and it has been almost two minutes.
I have used a piece of Citizen before, and I feel that it will not be a few seconds away in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, the timing function is a bit tasteless, and it is basically not used, and occasionally it is accidentally touched to enter the timing mode.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging, no need to worry about having to replace the battery, with world time, a variety of alarms and whole-point reminders.
Deficiencies: The mirror surface is easy to scratch and get into dust.
Cost-effective: The general domestic price is between 220-300, and overseas purchases are more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch
It must be genuine. I went to the counter to inspect the goods. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, and the materials are sufficient. In addition, it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is unmatched by those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches. This one is genuine.
The timing of the watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. There is a jewelry identification certificate in the packaging of the watch, and the 12 characters on the dial are real diamonds. This is very suitable for wearing by yourself, and it is also very dignified to send it out as a gift.
The Bentley watch is really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife's mobile phone fell, and she immediately came to Amazon to order an 8p on a whim. It was in stock, but it was not self-operated and there was no price increase (secretly happy in my heart). Since the delivery is not self-operated, it is relatively slow. The system shows that the latest delivery is expected to be on September 27.
My wife was so uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She told me to think of a way at 6 o'clock in the morning the next day. Later, I went to Jingdong to see that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered on the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying the new one, I thought about canceling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it is impossible to receive the express delivery in the early hours of the morning. I called the customer service after 7 o'clock to request cancellation of the order. The customer service replied that it has been cancelled. Please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I just waited patiently. When I took a look on my mobile phone at noon, the order was still in the state and was still not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order quickly. The customer service replied that the operation was OK.
When I got on the phone at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact the customer service again to make it clear that it had been called for the third time. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship it!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and had to wait for the system to be familiar before canceling the order.
But tell me clearly that the seller already knows and will never ship. Please rest assured.
When I waited until Monday to look at the order display, it turned out that it had been shipped, and I was speechless.
Since the seller cannot be contacted directly, he can only call customer service again.
The subsequent processing was simply speechless, basically I said one step, and the customer service continued to operate.
The order is still in the rejected state of delivery so far, and it is preparing to be delivered again!
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
It doesn't matter if the seller's company collects the money anyway or doesn't follow up.
To sum up, I will never prepay for large items in the future, it's too troublesome to look like this.

After checking the Internet, I found that many people have this problem. It took more than two hours to get it. I changed the settings of the router. Finally, I used 360WIFI as the medium to fix it. During the period, I called Xiaomi customer service. They didn't have any solution to this problem, so they directly asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments on the Internet saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the smaller the storage capacity, it will not be recognized. I hope you will pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, and the machine has a certain degree of fever. If it is turned on all the time, it feels that this degree of fever is a bit unacceptable.

This parameter is only available on Pentium III processors using the core codenames Katmai and Coppermine. The processor serial number is a unique 96-bit long binary number (actually only 64 bits are used). Each processor corresponds to only one serial number. The serial number can be used to track the entire process of the processor from production to sales. Intel claims that the reason for introducing this feature is “In order to improve the security of e-commerce, for example, you can only use a certain bank card on a certain computer”, but it has caused strong privacy and national security disputes in many countries and regions such as China, the United States and Europe, and the people believe that this feature infringes.

This paradox points out that there is no finite additive measure defined on the spherical surface, and its value is equal to all subsets that are congruent to each other (Hausdorff also proved that there is no countable additive measure that can be defined on all subsets), and the structure of the group formed by the rotation of the ball plays a key role here-and this does not hold true on planes or line segments; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area that makes all subsets that are congruent to each other have equal measures (this is the case). The structure of the group formed by the rotation of the ball plays a key role here-and this narrative does not hold true on planes or line segments; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area that makes all subsets that are congruent to each other have equal measures (this The length of the point pair on the real number line is the same); however, this is only finite additive, so this is not a measure in the full sense, but for the property of “making all subsets that are congruent to each other have equal measures”, this measure is equal to the Lebesgue measure, and this means that two equi-decomposable open sets that are equal in plane or real numbers have the same area.
After the exploration was completed, the new Sam discovered three jammers and recorded their location coordinates. When he returned to the base, the old Sam happened to find the secret room where the replicator was placed. The secret room was located underground next to the sleeping box. Since it was only here when he had to go back, it was never found. The two Sams then entered the secret room to check and found that there were hundreds of Sams inside, each of which was placed in the freezer and had not yet been awakened. While the new Sam continued to explore the secret room, the old Sam took the video phone out, destroyed one of the jammers and communicated with the earth. After contacting Sam's family, he found out that his wife died a few years ago. His daughter was 15 years old, not the 3 years old in the film. The videos that came from his wife in the past three years were actually received by the real Sam in this base for 3 years. The company saved the images and showed them to later Sam in chronological order, but the real Sam had already returned to earth and stayed at home.

In the end, he resisted the fusion of time and space of Felicia and destroyed Felicia.

Some people may think that saying “corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children” is reversing cause and effect. The real causal relationship should be “more bad behavior in children leads to more physical punishment”; however, studies have shown that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed “corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children”, not “more bad behavior in children leads to more physical punishment”, and “corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children” This point is supported by subsequent analysis; in addition, even in controlling the social status of parents and other variables that may affect children's behavior. After that, the point that “corporal punishment leads to more bad behaviors in children” is still true, that is, corporal punishment itself does lead to more bad behaviors in children, and its adverse effects cannot be explained by any other possible reasons; there are also studies that believe that educational strategies with both care and supervision can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying incidents, while exclusion, laissez-faire, and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.
The original MV was released on December 14, 2012. In the MV, the Sandman is played by Melanie Gaydos. She first appeared next to Richard Kruspe in her sleep and put him into a painful state. At the same time, Till kidnapped a group of orphans and locked them in a cage in the main bathroom. A female guard tried to defend the children with a shotgun. Till defeated her. The guard was young for a while and old for a while, but Till's age has not changed to show his immortality and superpowers. When guarding the orphans, Till used a grotesque The children were then used by other band members for various examinations and operations. One of the operations was to extract the child's tears with a syringe and then inject them into the body of the Sandman. She was wearing a skirt with two children, indicating the relationship between tears and in vitro fertilization. When Till left the main bathroom, the children (played by the band members) escaped from their cages and orphanages, which caused Till to pull out and eat his own heart, while the orphanage was engulfed by fire.

The leader of the Origami Alliance, Guanglong's father, has been delusional about reaching the Elven realm to dominate the entire world. After 26 episodes of fierce fighting, he was entered into the Elven realm by Zhizhe, but unexpectedly reached the cage of the demon wolf Fenrill and was absorbed. Because of the opening of the moon Road, the absorbed leader also came to Neo City to destroy the earth, absorbing a large amount of Maijia origami, the demon wolf Fenrill was officially resurrected, and also in order to protect the place where the central tower is connected to the stone tower on the moon, a clone was left to guard it. At the instigation of Wu Jingzhi, he absorbed and dealt with Maijia.

Later, after Fenrill was defeated, he returned to his original state without a mask, but went to stabilize the elf world with Guanglong's mother.
In this military service account, it is recorded that Kenshin placed Jingsheng at the highest position of other Uesugi Ichimen (Yamaura, Ujo, Guzhi, etc.), and Jingsheng had the largest number of troops in his family (originally, the largest number of troops was Yamayoshi Toyosu; after Toyosu's death in the 5th year of Tianzheng (1577), part of his retainers was assigned to the 50th cavalry group of Jingsheng's direct troops, which was combined into Jingsheng's Ueda group), and the retainers' name for Jingsheng was the same as Kenshin's honorific name “Misaki Castle”. Similar to the “Mikuni Castle”, the other sects are referred to as “Shiro Hall” and other common names, or they are called by their surnames plus “hall” (Yamaura Kuniqing and Uejo Masafumi were Kenshin's adopted sons, but they became the masters of the separation), and Jingsheng, who received the same honorific titles as Kenshin, such as “imperial”, “Place of residence (Nakajo)” and “様”, as Kenshin's adopted son, should be given a higher status.
In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed deputy governor of the British colony of Bencoolen. He was convinced that Britain must discover a strategic location that could surpass the then overlord the Netherlands. At that time, the trade routes connected China, the United Kingdom and India, especially for Chinese trade. A stronghold is particularly needed. In addition, the Netherlands strangles British trade in the region and prohibits the sale of British goods in Dutch-controlled ports, especially Batavia in the Netherlands, where the price of goods levied is quite unfavorable. The challenge facing Raffles is to establish a new port within the Dutch sphere of influence, but At that time, British ports were no longer suitable as trade centers. They were all too far from the Strait of Malacca. When large ships wanted to trade with Indochina and passed through at this time, they had to enter from the adjacent Indian Ocean, otherwise they had to enter from the farther Sunda Strait, but it was too far away from the main trade giants, and other locations had to return to the original problem-too close to the Netherlands, or there were other problems.

The Dakwali family originally planned to take care of Malefun Lefen alone, but she kept crying (another saying is that she was born dumb), refused to drink milk or let the women of the family bathe for herself, until the family found the Manigai of another group, he was willing to drink milk, and the Tu'uligit family (Tu'uligit) came to help take a bath or change diapers, she would not cry, so later, the two families helped take care of her daily life, and the Dakwali family was responsible for providing food and taking the girl home at night (another saying). It is believed that the ancestors of the two families were transformed by Satan (who used divine power to take care of her), while the other family, the Vikivan family, is responsible for the vigilance; when the baby girl can start to eat solid food, only the heart, liver, hind legs and other parts are eaten, so the tribe must dedicate these parts when hunting or killing pigs, which is the origin of the contribution (vadis).

Sturmelmann began to withdraw his troops from the north of the encirclement and break through to the south, hoping to reach the north bank of the Grotikish River to rendezvous with the relief forces. The fanatical fighters in the salient misunderstood the Soviet army, thinking that they had surrounded most of the troops of the 8th Army. The encircled troops occupied three villages in the encirclement to obtain a favorable starting line to break through the encirclement, the 105th Armored Grenadiers of the 72nd Infantry Division captured these three villages, and the weakened group needed to mount a mountain attack without cover and the Soviet army had dug trenches to hold on. Colonel Robert Swift, the commander of the 105th Armored Grenadiers, decided to counterattack in the evening.

During the battle, the 105th Armored Grenadiers captured the ridge within a few minutes. The next night, the 105th Armored Grenadiers reached Komarovka in a similar way.
According to the current official timeline setting, the oldest work in history is "Sword of the Royal Sky", and the most recent is "Tears of the Kingdom" (although Nintendo has not yet summarized this work and "Breath of the Wilderness" into the aforementioned three timeframes), but in order to meet the needs of the deep expansion of the worldview and timeline in the production of the game, most of the plot settings of this series will be retroactively revised to complete or correct in different works; take the Temple of Time mentioned in the 1998 "Flute of Time" work as an example, it is located in the temple that can travel through time and space until 2011. The origin of the temple and the Time Gate was explained in the plot of "Sword of the Royal Sky", which was launched in 2009, and the launch time of the two works has been 13 years apart; this method of flashback through the plot timeline effectively analyzes and expands Salda's worldview again and again, and gradually solves the mystery of the plot of the works of the past.
As the dragons gradually discovered the true identities of the eight great demon gods and the potential danger of over-relying on their spell abilities, the dragons began to develop "stunning incarnations", which are absolutely (no) colored incarnations made of long shapes and materials completely different from ordinary incarnations. The super abilities hidden inside can be said to be the ultimate power to restrain ancient demons. However, after the research and development was completed, the terrible monsters created by the dragons' ambition to invade the world-multiple genomes, beasts-also devoured the elf world because they were out of control. They were huge and fierce, and beasts that ate everything, because they grew up to The terrible degree that even the fire spell could not be burned. Under the final bet, the Dragon Clan had to mobilize the power of all the ruins and send the entire Elven world to outer space to burn the beasts with a hot fire out of the atmosphere. Since then, the civilization and technology on the earth, and the Elven world built into the moon, have gradually lost their connection.

Most digital libraries will provide a window that allows resource queries. These materials are typical resources that are hidden deep on the Internet (or rarely or even not on the Internet). These materials hidden deep on the Internet are often not found by people who use search engines, so there are some digital libraries. They create special pages or outlets that allow most search engines to find all their data. Many digital libraries often use the (OAI-PMH) open database protocol to obtain post-data so that their post-data is displayed in other digital libraries, and many search engines like Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo!And Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find out these data hidden in the Internet, so through this agreement, both search engines and digital libraries can benefit, and they can also make each other more closely related, and achieve the purpose of strengthening the characteristics of their own websites.

Since the final victory of the U.S. military on Melon Island in early 1943, in addition to the U.S.-Australian coalition led by Macarthur and William Halsey's U.S. South Pacific Fleet counterattack in New Guinea, the U.S. Joint Operations Conference has also decided that in the late 1943, the U.S. Navy began a counterattack plan from the Central Pacific. This plan was the responsibility of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, and was strongly supported by Nimitz in armaments and materials. Before the battle of the Gilbert Islands, the 5th Fleet consisted of at least 10 aircraft carriers and more than 7 warships, almost including Thomas.

In the “Polarized Light” timeline, after K2 ordered a separate operation, M950A acted with Thunder and lightning to rescue the commander, but the two were quickly caught up by the regular army team. During the operation, M950A's legs were blown off and he could only rely on thunder and lightning to help, and he fell into a coma. Just when the two were surrounded by the regular army team and were about to be destroyed, a “prototype fairy” secretly took advantage of the regular army team when it was attracted by other fairies, removed his body and used it to repair and upgrade the M950A. The upgraded M950A has greatly increased in strength. One person easily wiped out several regular army soldiers. After moving the thunder and lightning to a safe place, he decided to use it as bait to attract another group of regular army troops. Finally, M950A lured the troops to the underpass and then shot off the supporting beams and columns. Buried all the regular army troops (including himself) in the underpass alive, and then the traumatized M950A crawled out of the ground with his bare hands and started fighting with regular army officers.
In the end, TNT only had more than 100 diehard hammer fans scheduled for TNT. The scarce production caused the factory to refuse to start work, and these subscribers could not get the goods. Some media people commented that this was also the root problem of the hammer: Luo Yonghao was extremely conceited and had great dreams, but he didn't seem to have the same huge capital pool and technological innovation power. At first, he relied on a kind of “Chinese craftsman Seiko dream” ideology and words to cater to the rebellious style of online youth attracted a group of fans. These iron fans are somewhat capable of becoming employees, and others are consumer customers, but the ideology will always burn out one day. The final market will test your technical hard power. At present, the hammer is at best. There is only the ability to create or rewrite APPS, and it is still a brand factory that assembles the stock of upstream suppliers. The spirit of craftsmanship is reflected in the shell construction. However, there are very few changes that can be made in the mobile phone shell. Now the automated processing technology also makes the shell technology of each manufacturer different. In fact, the shell technology is not very different, and the other brand is not necessarily “not seiko”. Where to go.

Although the push is random, not everyone or every time you open the software will appear, but because the trigger is too sensitive, it once caused many complaints.

Kovalev now knew that the Germans were breaking through, so he was angered and determined to honor Stalin's promise not to give any “Hitler elements” or “fascists” to escape from the encirclement, but the Soviet intelligence agencies overestimated the armored strength of the German 3rd Armored Army at this time, so Kovalev attacked with all his strength. At this time, the tank brigade of the Soviet 20th Tank Army brought the new Joseph Stalin heavy tank to the Colson battlefield. Kovalev ordered all available armored vehicles and artillery to fire on the breakthrough forces, cut off the enemies in the arc and break them up. The Soviet infantry division in charge of the blockade, the 206th Sniper Division and the 5th Guards Airborne Division have been defeated by the German relief forces; Soviet tanks without infantry support had to fire at the German troops who broke through from a long distance. Since there were no anti-tank weapons on the battlefield, the T-34 tank rushed into the German army without cover, and the command unit, the soldiers who were out of date, and the ambulance were all attacked.
In the 187th episode of the remake of the manga, the ugly president and the gums were almost swallowed by the gums several times in the battle, but they were all successfully rescued by the pig God. Then, in order to save the hostages of the mercenary group controlled by the ugly president, the pig God was asked to swallow the hostages first and throw the pig God out of the battlefield, and then deal with the ugly president together with the tornado, but the tornado was knocked to the wall by the ugly president and fell unconscious, causing him to fight with the president's “forearm collapse fist” with a “vest grapple” alone but lost.

In the end, the limbs were twisted and out of shape. He was eventually thrown to the gums and swallowed, but was later rescued by Silver Teeth.
The design work of the Kirov-class cruiser officially began in 1968, codenamed Project 1144.1. The initial plan was 8,000 tons, but Brezhnev and other Soviet leaders at that time seemed to prefer the big guys. Because the environment was conducive to the vigorous development of the navy, the founder of the Soviet navy Gorshkov was determined to be firm, and the high-level navy was able to move around at the meeting of ministers, and the ambition of Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire was raised as evidence, so the design of this class of ships has a tonnage of 8,000 tons and is equipped with 6-8 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers. Missiles, but this is not the same as the Kresta II-class cruiser under construction at the time, and there are also Kara-class cruisers with larger tonnage and gas turbines under development. Such specifications cannot be installed in accordance with the established vision of nuclear reactors, nor can they pass the high-level review of the big guys with special hobbies, so the plan was revised several times, and finally the full load displacement was increased to 15,000 tons and then to 20,000 tons, and finally fixed at 24,300 tons.
The 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade launched a landing operation with the support of the amphibious armored vehicles of the Royal Engineers of the British 5th Attack Group (the first time such vehicles were used on the European battlefield) and tracked amphibious landing vehicles. The brigade plans to use amphibious landing vehicles to cross the entrance of Blackman Bay and land near Hof de Platte. This is a complete village on the other side of the pocket, so pressure is applied from both the left and the right at the same time. Although it was difficult to mobilize vehicles and delayed for 24 hours when passing through the canal, the Germans were still shocked by the attack and the Allies quickly established a bridgehead. Once again, the Germans quickly recovered and launched a fierce counterattack; however, they retreated slowly, and the Canadian 10th Infantry Brigade under the Canadian 4th Armored Division crossed the Leopold Canal and attacked the low-lying area of Isabel, while the Canadian 8th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to advance south from the encirclement coastal area, which opened up the land supply route to the pocket.

People have different views on whether the survival and abolition of the death penalty can be determined by public opinion; in practice, there have been governments that have left the survival and abolition of the death penalty to public opinion. California held a referendum on the death penalty in 2012. The content of the referendum was whether the people supported the adoption of Proposition 34 (Proposition 34), and the content of Proposition 34, simply put, is “California abolishes the death penalty”, so once the result of the referendum is to pass Proposition 34, then California will abolish the death penalty, but if the result of the referendum is not to pass Proposition 34, then California will retain the death penalty; and although The party that supported the passage of Proposition 34 spent more than six times as much on publicity as it opposed the bill. The result of the final referendum was that 52% of voters opposed the passage of the bill, while 48% supported the passage of the bill. Therefore, the bill was not passed in the end, and California continued to retain the death penalty.
At the same time, on August 18th, 87 vehicles of the Polish 1st Armored Division commanded by Raf Marcek to the east of the Canadian Army captured Hill 262 (called Mont-Ormel in French and The Mace in English) to prevent any counterattack launched by the besieged German army from the east. Here, they can also condescend to observe the road from Chambois to Vimouje (now the only road that can escape the encirclement) and attack the collapsed German army.

When the applied energy is injected into an energy-level system in the form of electric fields, photons, chemistry, etc. and absorbed by it, it will cause electrons to transition from the low-energy level to the high-energy level. When the photons generated by spontaneous radiation encounter these electrons that jump to the high-energy level due to the applied energy, these high-energy electrons will be induced to move to the low-energy level and release photons (The so-called stimulated radiation). All the optical properties of the stimulated radiation are the same as the original spontaneous radiation, including: frequency, phase, forward direction, etc., When these stimulated radiation photons encounter other electrons that jump to the high-energy level due to the applied energy. , More of the same photons will be produced again, and finally the intensity of the light becomes greater and greater (that is, the energy of the light is amplified), and unlike ordinary light, all photons have the same frequency, phase (homology), and direction of progress.
After the two arrive at the warehouse auction venue, they often encounter some opponents who are also warehouse bidders when they walk into the door. They will try to say hello to each other for some simple social greetings, and ask the other party if there are bidders in the local area who should pay attention.

After the leaves of the Lanren tree wither, they are collected, boiled, and brewed. The so-called black water in the aquarium can be used to strengthen the estrus of Thai betta fish and improve conception. It can be verified that in the breeding of Thai betta fish, the lanren leaves release nutrients; Tannic acid, which darkens the water color and increases the water color to simulate the environmental conditions of black water. It can stabilize the mood of the fish and relieve stress as soon as possible. Maladaptive, strengthen and improve the body; tail and dorsal fin color, reduce PH value (increase acidification), it contains a lot of tannic acid; humic acid; folic acid, etc., The pH value of water can be adjusted, and the effect of water softening can make the water slightly softer, but it also depends on the hardness of the raw water. If it is hard, you have to soak more leaves to achieve the same effect. Fish tanks with large-leaf lamin leaves soaked in them will become moldy later after the creatures die. Therefore, it is inferred that the large-leaf lamin leaves should have more or less anticorrosive functions that inhibit mold growth.
On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted a study on assault rifles. They concluded that although the existing 8mm mauser rifle bullets have a range of more than 800 meters, the long range is difficult to play in actual combat. The sight is not a popular equipment, and most soldiers' marksmanship is not up to the level of snipers, and the high rate of fire can suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing rifle bullets are too heavy on range, although powerful, but the recoil is too great, if it is to be used for fully automatic shooting, it will be difficult to hold stably, and the hit rate during continuous shooting is as low as it lacks practicality, so it is necessary to reduce the existing The idea of the charge of the 8mm mauser rifle bullet, by shortening the length of the ammunition, not only can reduce the recoil, but also reduce the weight, so in 1938, this shortened version of the 8mm mauser rifle bullet was launched. The bullet diameter is maintained at 7.92mm, and the length is only about half of the previous Mauser rifle bullet.
In addition, there are dances used on special occasions, such as the “victory dance” when celebrating the victory of the war and praising the merits, the “friendship dance” for social activities between neighbors or friends, etc., and the “ghost dance” that calls for ancestral spirits to fight with the souls of dead warriors after contact with white people and war, the “corn dance” that prays or thanks for a good harvest, or the “The Booger Dance” that prays to drive away disease or white people. Booger is a demon considered by the Cherokee, and the Booger dance is usually Indoors, some of the invited people will wear snake masks that symbolize Boog (after contact with white people, the devil's horns are added), and use aliases to indicate that they (Boog) are not for harming mankind but for dancing, and after dancing, they will be invited away peacefully.
Cat litter bucket toilets were first promoted in the Denver school district in Colorado, where there have been multiple school shootings. When there is an emergency such as a school shooting, the police will ask teachers and students to avoid the classroom until the police have checked the campus and confirmed that it is safe before coming out. John McDonald, the head of safety at Jefferson County Public Schools, said that the idea was proposed a few years ago.

The infection group originally caused by the cabin crew at the end of December 2021 belonged to the Omicron mutant virus. The virus gene sequence showed that they were all the earlier Omicron mutant virus strain BA.1 subtype, and the infection group caused by the quarantine hotel in early January 2022 belongs to the Omicron mutant virus strain BA.2 subtypes, although the two belong to the same Omicron mutant virus, there are 10 different variants of the spike protein of the two. Preliminary studies in the United Kingdom and Denmark have shown that BA.2 subtypes are better than BA.Subtype 1 is more contagious, BA.Subtype 2 leads to a higher rate of breakthrough infections among people who have received two doses of vaccine and three doses of vaccine, but people who have been vaccinated may reduce the chance of spreading to other people, and the first generation of the quarantine hotel group has spread to 12 people, showing Omicron mutant virus strain BA.Subtype 2 is more contagious than the virus strain previously discovered in Hong Kong, and it is more difficult to stop its widespread spread.

During the later years of his reign of Anastasius, he realized that he was running out of days, and he still had three living relatives, but Anastasius didn't know who was the most suitable successor, so he summoned three relatives to a room with three sofas. There is a letter hidden under one of them. As long as the person who chooses the right sofa is eligible to become the heir, however, two of the relatives are sitting on the same sofa, while the other is sitting on another sofa, but the sofa with the envelope is not selected, so Anas Tatius thought of another idea at this time. Who was the next person to walk in and who was the successor. As a result, the person who walked in was Justinian, the commander of his guards. Although Anastasius did not expect Justinian to become the successor, he was also very satisfied with the result, and Justinian became the emperor as a result.
The Japanese navy had been ordered to blockade the waters of Hong Kong at that time. When the British torpedo boat fleet sailed to the waters east of the Blue Pond Strait, it was discovered by the Japanese Fir-class destroyer and the Hong-type torpedo boat Magpie. Due to the far gap in firepower between the two sides, Chen Ce instructed the torpedo boat fleet to line up and hurried towards the Japanese ship at high speed, pretending to be about to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship. In fact, the torpedo boats at that time were designed to reduce their weight and carry as many people as possible, and to avoid the risk of the torpedo exploding after being hit by artillery fire, so they did not carry torpedoes, but the Japanese ships saw the torpedo boat fleet coming. It was raging, so he was fooled and took evasive actions. The torpedo boat team got rid of the Japanese ship's interception. The team passed through the Guozhou Islands and then turned to Dapeng Bay. Finally, Chen Ce and more than 70 others landed in South Australia on the Dapeng Peninsula. After that, the Chinese and British personnel quickly sunk all the torpedo boats to avoid the landing site being discovered and tracked by the Japanese, and then fled by land to Huizhou, Guangdong.
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism. For example, in the “Bunsen Sutra”, Bodhisattvas question why the god Brahma allows suffering and sin to run rampant, similar to the problem of evil. Some Buddhists also deny the existence of the god Brahma from the level of reason. Therefore, Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from the Great Brahma, the heavenly beings who are still trapped in reincarnation. In addition, Buddhism also denies that the Great Brahma is the origin of all things, and believes that the Great Brahma is only one of the five realms, so later some Hindu theologians accused Buddhism of promoting nihilism. However, Buddhism refutes this statement, arguing that the root of all things is "emptiness". It is emptiness that enables all things to appear and change, and meaning in it is constantly born with the origin and extinguished with the extinction of fate, so everything in the world is not meaningless, but because of impermanence, meaning cannot last forever. In the world.
In the mid-term creation, in addition to inheriting Dai Jin's style of painting, he also inherited the methods of Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, mainly freehand. At the same time, he imitated the paintings of white-painted figures such as Li Gonglin and Gu Kaizhi, and also studied Liang Kai, Wu Daozi, Liu Songnian and others. The picture is more relaxed and simple, broad and vigorous. At this time, Wu Wei was well-known in the capital and was later called into the palace, but because of his rebellious nature and not accustomed to life in the palace, he was not accustomed to flattery and the upper-class society that was gaining momentum. , So he resigned from the Academy of Painting, which caused a great change in his thinking. Contrary to the idea of pursuing fame and fortune and getting ahead when he was a teenager, his personality was more wild and unruly, indulging in pleasure, and it was also related to the drunkenness of Zhumen at that time. At this time, he rarely made paintings. "Real Portrait of Beihai", "Xuejiang Fishing Picture", and "Song and Dance Picture" reflect the author's true emotions of spiritual portrayal and observation of life.
The camel fighter was developed from the puppy fighter of the same company. A larger, heavier and more powerful air-cooled star engine increased the power of the camel from 80 horsepower to 130 horsepower, and the nose machine gun was also increased from one to two. Of course, it also cooperated with the shooting synchronization system imitated from the Germans. In order to prevent the machine gun from getting stuck due to the cold at high altitude, a fairing was added. Originally, this machine was called “Big dog”, but due to the protruding shape of this fairing, this machine was renamed “Camel”, which made The nose is heavier but the horizontal tail wing does not increase the area as a result. This makes the camel-style aircraft unstable due to its tendency to have a bit of a head when flying. This makes it difficult for pilots who have just driven the camel-style to drive, but veteran pilots can make good use of this instability and increase the flexibility of the camel-style in air combat.
After more than two decades of brilliant results, the abnormal rapid decline in the national team's subsequent results has made many fans unacceptable. Part of the reason is that fans cannot accept such a sudden decline in the national team. The Greek national basketball team suffered heavy defeats in the 1999 and 2001 European Championships, and lost the qualification for the Sydney Olympics and the 2002 World Championships. The poor record led to problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Association. In the end, the Greek national basketball team made a major adjustment in the team before the 2003 European Championships and hired a new coach Ronnie. With the addition of Ioannidis and a new group of young players, this adjustment attempt was partially successful. In the 2003 European Championships, the Greek team finally achieved the fifth place, but the public is not very satisfied, because the fifth place is still a long way from success.
When the investigation corps was performing the task of retaking, it stayed by the side of the beast giant and went to support after Lena asked for help. As soon as it appeared, the investigation corps suffered heavy casualties, almost reaching the loss of half of its combat power. Immediately, it fought with the investigation Corps and Ai Lian's giants, easily defeating all enemies, and even kicking Ai Lian to the wall. When he was about to catch Ai Lian, he was distracted by Almin's teeth pierced by the anchors of the three-dimensional mobile device, and when Almin was about to catch Ai Lian again, he was severely burned by the ultra-high temperature vapor. When Almin was about to catch Ai Lian again, he only found that Ai Lian's giant was only made of hard material. The clone formed by the transformation was immediately captured by Ai Lian using a blade to slash the back of his neck. Only then did I realize that everything was a feint attack plan. After being swallowed to death by the giant-turned Almin, he captured the power of the giant. Before he died, he briefly called for help to his contemporaries, but realized that they were already hostile to each other and changed their names to Lena and Yani.
After Japan surrendered unconditionally in August 1945, he returned to his hometown to run a watch shop and studied and learned photography techniques alone. Later, he often went to Hiroshima to photograph the surviving “bomb victims” (victims of the atomic bombing).

In the east is the undulating loess Plateau, 1500-2000 meters above sea level, the Yellow River and its tributaries Weihe and Taohe flow through, rich in hydraulic resources, south of the Qinling Mountains is the Bailong River Basin, the climate is warm and humid, the plants are dense, and the annual precipitation is about 500 mm; west of Wushaoling in the west, there are the Hexi Corridor formed by the confrontation of the south and north mountains. Nanshan is dominated by Qilian Mountain, with tall mountains, mostly above 3,000 or 4,000 meters, while the North Mountain is relatively low, mainly Longshou Mountain, Heli Mountain, etc., in the area. The rivers are inland water systems, most of which flow from south to north, including the Shule River and weak water. Among them, the weak water basin has the largest area, a dry climate, and an annual precipitation of about 150 mm. It is mainly semi-desert and desert. Due to the snowmelt irrigation of the Qilian Mountains, alluvial fans are formed at the foot of the mountains, and connected oases are formed where there are rivers in the corridor. It is the granary of Gansu, and the outside is mountainous and desert.
After the Observatory re-issued signal No. 1, Liufushan and Tsing Yi measured the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 43 kilometers per hour from 2:20 a.m. to 2:50 a.m. and from 3:40 a.m. to 3:46 a.m. on August 15, respectively. It was the first time a strong wind was measured during the storm at the two stations, and it was also the highest wind speed during the storm at the two stations. At the same time, the southwest of Hong Kong (Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, Airport, etc.) The wind trend remained high and continued to be affected by strong winds for nearly a whole day. As a result, at 2:00 a.m. on August 15th, it was the first time that a strong wind was measured during the storm, and it was also the highest wind speed during the storm at the two stations. At the same time, the wind trend remained high in the southwest of Hong Kong (Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, Airport, etc.) Between 45:00 and 3:45, 4 of the 8 designated automatic weather stations once again recorded strong winds, which met the requirements of signal No. 3. This caused some citizens to believe that the time for the Observatory to reissue signal No. 1 was also too early, and it was nearly 18 hours earlier than the time when the Macao Meteorological Bureau removed typhoon signal No. 3.
Regarding the time and location of Tiange's closest approach to Macau, the meteorological agencies of Hong Kong and Macao have their own opinions—the Macao Meteorological Bureau stated that Tiange was closest to Macau at 1 p.m. and passed about 40 kilometers west—southwest of the headquarters of the Meteorological Bureau; however, the post-mortem report of the Hong Kong Observatory and the positioning of the Macao Meteorological and Astronomical Bureau showed that Tiange passed only 20 kilometers south-southwest of the headquarters of the Macao Meteorological Bureau at 12 noon. Some citizens questioned whether the Meteorological Bureau had made mistakes in the positioning of Tiange. The structure of Tiange was complete and close, and there was no central circulation reorganization at that time, so the chance of positioning errors should be small; from the radar map It can be compared with the 2012 Typhoon Vicente that hit Macau. The positioning of the Meteorological Bureau is also 40 kilometers, and the diameter of the wind eye of Typhoon Vicente and Tiange is also 50 kilometers, but the center of Tiange is obviously closer to Macau than West, and the actual distance of Tiange may only be 20 kilometers.

However, some people think that this is a controversial piece of history. Nobunaga received the name “Bomb Masatoshi”, a name that can only be accepted as the lord, while Nobunaga received the name of Uesuke, the lord of the Imagawa family. It can be seen that Nobunaga's strange behavior before the Yuanfu was not trusted by Nobuhide and his retainers. The main city of the Oda family was Gudu Castle. In order to guard against the Mikawa offensive, the main city was built in Suemori and the main city was moved to Suemori instead of living in seclusion in Suemori. Nobunaga was the lord of the main city, but Nobunaga was instead. As for the lord of the branch city, as for Nobunaga's victory, it is related to the Olympic support of Hirate Masahide and Mino. It is difficult to give an answer to who betrayed who. In addition, Mino should have support troops. Under the historical view of the Warring States Period with the Three Heroes as the main axis, it must be hidden.

The cause of leukemia is a complex and sporadic mechanism. It is a multi-stage evolution process. This is also the key to its carcinogenic incidence rate of only 5%. In this process, the virus first binds to CD4+cells and activates the infected cells. IL-2 receptors are expressed on the cell membrane, and then viral DNA is formed by the reverse transcriptase of the virus and integrated into the host cell before the chromosome is formed. Virus; Under the action of the virus tax gene, CD4+cells IL-2 and its receptor genes begin to express abnormally, causing a large number of infected cells to proliferate, and host cells with viruses can be transformed into different viruses due to the diversity of viral DNA integration sites. In the process of cell replication, and as the cells continue to proliferate, a certain copied cell DNA mutates and evolves into leukemia cells, thereby forming leukemia cell replication.

So far, more than 1,400 films have used SDDS sound format, and only about 97 films have been recorded in a complete eight-channel mixing (Mix, including dubbing, soundtrack, and other sound effects production and editing, etc.). The vast majority of sound studios still use six (5.1)-channel system equipment instead of eight (7.1) channels for editing and production. In addition, SDDS's eight-channel recording equipment is quite expensive, which also makes many studios unable to purchase and add new equipment, which also makes the subsequent development into a more budget, larger production venue, and more Only studios that can allow more production and broadcasting equipment to be placed have an eight-channel recording system available.
The first thing in the history of value engineering development was the asbestos incident of General Electric (GE) in the United States. During World War II, the supply of raw materials in the United States market was very tight. GE urgently needed asbestos board, but the supply of this product was unstable and expensive. GE engineers at the time began to study the problem of material substitution for this problem. Through the analysis of the company's use of asbestos board, it was found that its purpose was to lay it on the floor of the workshop where the product was painted to avoid the paint contaminating the floor and causing a fire. Later, Miles found a kind of fireproof paper on the market. This kind of paper can also play the above roles, and the cost is low, easy to buy and obtain. Very good economic benefits, this is the earliest value engineering application case.
Lithography technology was first invented by Czech-German Alois Senefelder in 1798. At that time, because copperplate printing was too expensive, he used limestone from Bavaria as the material for engraving prints, and lithography was his tool for adjusting ink. By accident, his mother asked him to write down the laundry list, but the paper and ink around him ran out, so he had to use his correction fluid (composed of yellow wax, soap, black pigment and water) to write on the lithography. Later, he was curious and poured some nitric acid on it. ; Because the correction fluid has corrosion-resistant components, the handwriting is raised, which is the beginning of the use of slate for printing.
Usually the reason is that some village committees in inland provinces are still controlled by older generations with older concepts. They believe that family property-related affairs should be mainly inherited from the patrilineal line. If a woman has something in her name, it will become “someone else's” and other weird concepts. Therefore, unmarried women who do not act in accordance with regulations, especially by the village committee, are “guarded” and will not easily allocate land. Many rural women also have no legal concept and do not know their own rights and interests, thinking that they are accustomed to tradition. In fact, Article 32 of the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests stipulates that women contract and operate rural land, distribute the income of collective economic organizations, and expropriate or expropriate compensation fees. In terms of use and homestead use, they enjoy equal rights with men, and both men and women are members of rural collective economic organizations.
Spain faced its group stage opponent Italy again in the final. The two teams in the group stage were tied. However, in the final, the Spanish team played the “no front formation” into “all the team is front”, and its offensive power increased greatly.

After washing a transparent pet bottle, fill it with about 5~10cc of tap water inside and close the bottle tightly. Shake the bottle vigorously for a few seconds to make the partial pressure of water vapor in the bottle close to saturation. Then open the bottle cap and put a little bit of burning and visible smoke into the bottle. After about one second, the line fragrance is drawn out and the bottle cap is immediately closed tightly. At this time, press the pet bottle hard, that is, the gas in the pet bottle is adiabatic compressed to heat it up, you can see that the pet bottle is in a transparent state, maintain it for a few seconds so that the heat energy escapes to the outside world, and then release the pet bottle to let it go. Rebound, that is, for adiabatic expansion, the bottle cools down and clouds and fog are generated due to the presence of condensation nuclei.

Hong Kong Shue Yan College, founded in 1971, was later registered as Hong Kong Shue Yan College in 1976 in accordance with the "Post-secondary Colleges Ordinance". However, since Shue Yan College does not follow the government's implementation of the three-year university system and continues to offer a four-year bachelor's degree program, it has not been able to receive government funding like the Baptist College and Lingnan College, which were restructured in accordance with the Government's requirements. Since then, the development of the school has been greatly restricted. It can only award honorary diplomas and cannot award formal degrees. Until the Hong Kong Government supported the development of private universities after 2000 and planned to implement the three-three-four academic system, Shue Yan College was approved to offer accredited bachelor's degree programs. After passing the subject scope assessment, Hong Kong Shue Yan College was approved by the Government in December 2006 and was officially named Hong Kong Shue Yan University, becoming the first private university in Hong Kong. Shue Yan University was still the only private university in Hong Kong until October 2018.

Malaysia's original plan for a new generation of offshore Patrol vessel (Next Generation Patrol Vessel, NGPV) proposed in the early 1990s was won by Germany (Kedah-class frigate, MEKO 100 RMN). The first two ships of the original agreement between the two parties were completed in Germany and then shipped to Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company in Malaysia for assembly. The follow-up ships were built by Blom-Foss to assist Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company. The contract was changed two years later. The first two ships were delivered to the Royal Malaysian Navy after the completion of the construction in Germany. It was originally expected to cost 24.3 billion ringgit, within 20 years. 27 ships were purchased in batches. Due to continuous progress delays and overspending, the construction of the subsequent 21 ships was cancelled and the tender was re-tendered. The planned name was also changed to the Second Generation Patrol Vessels/Littoral Combat Ship (SGPV/LCS). The Maharajah-class derived from the French wind chaser-class frigate design won the bid.
A year after the resistance forces successfully escaped the pursuit of the First Army, when the supreme leader of the First Army, Kairo Shinobu, led his troops to continue to suppress the resistance of other planets, he realized through the Sith pathfinder he found that there was a huge dark force lurking in the depths of the “unknown area”. Following the clues, he finally found the source of this dark force in a dark and huge building on Exegol in the depths of the “Unknown Area”: Bai Bu Ting, the emperor of the Galactic Empire, who was supposed to have been dead for more than 30 years, the emperor of the Galactic Empire has since officially declared to the whole galaxy that he is still alive. , Kairo Shinobu later reached an agreement with him. After Kairo Shinobu kills the last Jedi, the “Final Legion” of the Sith fleet hidden on the planet will be included in the First Legion, and Kairo Shinobu will become the emperor of the new Galactic Empire.
The Zengwen Stream Basin where the Zengwen Reservoir is located has a total length of 138.47 kilometers and a watershed area of 1,176 square kilometers. It is the fourth largest river in Taiwan. Its average annual flow rate is 1.6 billion cubic meters. The average annual flow rate at the dam site is 1.064 billion cubic meters. The Japanese technician Yata Yoichi, who designed Jianan Zhen in the early days, used the upper reaches of Guantian Creek, a branch of Zengwen Creek, to build Wushantou Reservoir, and set up a dam in Tai Po Creek to take water through a tunnel to Wushantou Reservoir to supply farmland in the Jianan area for irrigation, but its water intake rate is only half of the total flow. 25% (according to the Zengwen Reservoir construction plan, before the Zengwen Reservoir was built, the Wushantou Reservoir originally used 330 million cubic meters of water). Therefore, if the dam is built directly on the main stream of Zengwen Creek and operated in series with the Wushantou Reservoir, the amount of irrigation can be increased. Therefore, in 1939, Yata and Yi had proposed to build a dam on the site of the current dam, but it was abandoned due to the war.

The cosmic monster that has fought against Topless so far was originally evolved from the automatic defense system left over from the predecessors, and the alien Buster crew is the real cosmic monster. Topless is just a disease mutated by humans. After learning the truth, “Laruko” became violent and gave up and clashed with Nono. After that, the cosmic army, under the leadership of Nono, went to explore a giant real cosmic monster sealed in a black hole, but at this time the real cosmic monster broke out of the black hole, and before the real cosmic monster of the size of the planet, Nono and “Laruko” had a conflict. After that, the cosmic army, under the leadership of Nono, went to explore a giant real cosmic monster sealed in a black hole, but at this time the real cosmic monster broke out of the black hole, and before the real cosmic monster of the size of the planet, Nono and “Laruko” “All attacks of ”Laruko" could not be damaged by half a millimeter.

The difference from the State Duma lies in the departments under the jurisdiction of political parties. The committee clearly shows that no political party exists in the upper house. In 2001, about 100 Upper house members formed a relatively loose party group, which supported almost all the policies of then-President Putin. However, what was even more frustrating in 2002 was the dissolution of all the party groups after Mironov won the election as chairman. Although the most important thing in a democratic country is not consensus, it is difficult for the Federal Committee, which is the upper house of Congress, to gather a considerable consensus, and then it is difficult to pass any resolutions. Instead, the bill is debating with the chairman or various committees. After that, it was easier to pass, and the parliamentarians themselves were asked not to reflect the original ideology of the political parties in the proceedings. After the reform in 2000, the committee obviously moved closer to the authorities of the Kremlin, making it easy for important bills to pass to meet the requirements of the Kremlin.

Makdis mentioned in the literature: “The taxes levied in Syria are not heavy, but the taxes levied in caravan stations are an exception. Travelers in the stations will be drawn extremely harsh and high taxes... ”The taxes mentioned here refer to the customs duties levied by local government officials on imported goods and commodities.

The Genting tunnel has a long-term speed limit of 80km/h due to diseases (arches on the overall road bed, a large number of cracks, and high gas concentration). On February 3, 2020, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake occurred in Qingbaijiang District, Chengdu. The epicenter was located near the Genting tunnel, which aggravated the tunnel diseases. In addition, the suspension of a large number of trains during the novel coronavirus epidemic provided an unprecedented opportunity for the comprehensive rehabilitation of the line. Therefore, in mid-February 2020, the Genting tunnel began semi-enclosed construction. During the construction period, the general-speed buses and CR200J emus that passed through the Suicheng line were transferred to the old line to operate. , The power distribution EMU was shortened to operate from Suining Station of the Suiyu Railway, and the passenger service of the Suicheng Railway was temporarily suspended and only freight trains were operated.

During the course of the battle, the Protoss originally believed that the El Zerg would become wild without a head after the death of its master. They did not expect that there would be mixed-origin bodies in the swarm to carry out systematic tactical command, which surprised Atannis and Zeratu. Then the powerful dark forces of Yamon invaded the Protoss mind and spirit network-Kara, instantly controlling most of the Protoss on El, including Archbishop Atannis and Executive Officer Silentis. Since Zeratu belongs to the Dark Templar of Nirasim, their people have not been willing to connect with Kara since ancient times, so their minds have not been affected by Yamon. Therefore, Zeratu immediately led the team to save Artannis, hoping to cut off the nerve cord connected to Kara before he was controlled by Yamon, but it was too late.

Therefore, he wrote to Emperor Wu that he could control Nanyue through Yilang. Therefore, Emperor Wu sent Tang Meng to send an envoy to Yilang, seeing that his leader, Yilanghou, was much the same, and gave him a generous gift. He agreed to set up a county official in the local area and use his son as the county magistrate, Yilanghou. Thinking that his country was far away from the Han Dynasty, he agreed for the time being, but then he repeatedly refused to obey the Han Dynasty, so he had the famous saying “Who is the Han Dynasty and I am big”, which became an allusion to the idiom "Ye Lang is arrogant".
When the T7606/7607 T7608/7605 express train was opened, the EMU train had been changed to the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway, so this train did not need to be on the Shanghai-Nanjing line to avoid the EMU train, and the Chizhou to Shanghai section only took 7 hours and 13 minutes, but due to the low standard of the Ningtong Railway, the average speed of the train is still less than 80 kilometers per hour, compared with the same line of road passenger transport, there is still no speed advantage, in addition, this car is compared with T7776/7777 T7778/7775 times. Trains are inextricably linked. Therefore, railway enthusiasts have continued the nickname “Huchi Extra Slow” to this train. After the train was extended to Dongzhi Station, there was a new nickname “Hudong Extra Slow”, but there are still many railway enthusiasts habitually use the nickname “Huchi Extra slow”.
Traditional digital modulation and division of labor use frequency division and division of labor to transmit different information through different frequency bands. OFDM divides an entire frequency band into several sub-carriers, and each sub-carrier is orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap each other in the spectrum, which can reduce interference. The mode of operation is to place the signal in the frequency domain at the transmitting end, convert it to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform (IDFT), and transmit it after adding a cyclic prefix, while the receiving end removes the signal. Cyclic prefix, and then the time domain signal is converted back to the frequency domain through Fourier transform (DFT) to solve the original transmission signal.

The early description of the cryptomycota was that it was parasitic on the surface of the host cell, lacked a cell wall, and had a morphology similar to chytrid bacteria. The morphology and intracellular parasitic life history are atypical, but this classification method has many shortcomings. The etymology of “hidden” means that such organisms have been ignored by researchers for a long time. The mystery was not uncovered until the rise of molecular sequence analysis, but this feature is applicable to many other eukaryotes and is not a patent for cryptomycota. As for whether the genus Rhodes is representative, there is also room for discussion, because there is still little understanding of the life history of cryptomycota, and it is not clear whether most species can have cells at the same time. There are two life styles, surface parasitism and intracellular parasitism, so the pattern and life history of Rhodes bacteria may not be atypical.

Williams' syndrome is a genetic disease that occurs because 25-28 genes in the long arm of the 7th pair of chromosomes are deleted. This condition is usually an occasional event that occurs when eggs or sperm are formed; in a few cases, Williams' syndrome is inherited from parents with dominant diseases (body dominant genetic diseases); the patient's special facial features (wide mouth, sky-facing nose, long, narrow and small chin, bubble eyes, pointed ears, long neck, oblique shoulders, etc.) are often considered to be missing specific genes, usually diagnosed based on symptoms. Suspicion (for example, there is heart valve atresia, aortic stenosis, SVAS, etc. at birth), and the ELN gene probe test by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to confirm the disease.
It is also a plant-based material. The biggest difference between ancient Egyptian papyrus and Chinese paper is that papyrus is made by sticking papyrus pieces together. The papyrus fibers are not decomposed. The arrangement of the fibers still retains the natural order. The singularity of the fiber arrangement is heavy, which is not conducive to writing, folding and drying. Moreover, the raw material, papyrus, is only available in the Nile basin; The fibers in Chinese paper are different from the orderly arrangement of the fibers of the plant world and the geometric arrangement of textiles, but the arrangement of random intersections, simple production and appropriate cementation and bonding, forming a material that is both light and strong and absorbent. Therefore, It can be used to preserve data for a long time, and the raw materials are also very diverse. Plants from all environments can be used and eventually spread all over the world.
Since fantasy novels mostly come from online writers, they are published on the Internet at the same time as they are written. They often change their style during serialization to suit the audience (because they have the possibility of expressing opinions in real time, they are more like viewers than readers). These changes may make the content of the novel often inconsistent, but as long as the plot arrangement is brilliant and reasonable, there is no need to specifically distinguish the category of the work, and the weight of the chapter theme can also be used as a distinction. If the theme of each chapter is in the fictional world and only a few other non-traditional plots are added, it can be classified as a fantasy novel; if the chapters are surrounded by martial arts, science fiction and magic. Just as an embellishment, it is more recognized as a fantasy novel.

Whenever there is a large-scale disaster (such as an epidemic), rolls of toilet paper are extremely easy to be sold out. Some analysts believe that because Western countries or regions that respect Western civilization will consume a lot of toilet paper; due to the uncertain future development of the disaster (including the response of the Chinese government to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.), it may lead to long-term isolation, which makes people increase their stock of various materials; rolls of toilet paper are a large and conspicuous item in stores, and the rapid speed of snapping up leads to the situation where the shelves are easily emptied, which will further exacerbate people's panic about material shortages and fear of missing out. Psychology, In the end, it was difficult for the speed at which stores replenished their shelves to keep up with the speed at which people snapped up.
This is not reasonable, because a good nib is often a high-end pen and has a certain weight. Secondly, when writing, you need to press the nib hard to make a thick and thin effect, but ballpoint pens can only do it even if you put the paper on a soft material to write. Ballpoint pens often have a better effect on hard pen calligraphy and have more room to play, but there must be a certain degree of understanding of different writing skills, and the writer needs to have more observation. Pen calligraphy requires speed, because the water-based ink pen tip cannot write too slowly and stop at one point for too long. This point alone is far away. It is not as lightweight as a ballpoint pen. The only advantage of a pen is that the ink color is brighter than a ballpoint pen.
The surface speed of U-boats driven by diesel engines is not high, and they can only catch up with some slow merchant ships. The maximum underwater speed is less than 10 knots, generally about 4 knots (except for the XXI type, which is equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and a streamlined hull design, it can continue to operate at an unprecedented high speed of 17 knots underwater for one hour), in contrast, the destroyer has a maximum speed of 30 knots. In actual anti-submarine operations, due to the need to use active sonar and hydrophone, the ship speed is generally still 10-15. However, it is difficult for U-boats to avoid the depth charges of enemy destroyers underwater, and the lack of maneuverability is a fatal shortcoming of U-boats.

Chapter One
Hao Ren, as the name suggests, is a good person.
His family lives in a little-known northern town. If Beijing plans to build a 20th ring road and 30th ring road, it can barely be regarded as the foot of the Son of Heaven. If all the good people in the world are counted on his head according to the homonym, it can barely be regarded as famous in the world. Walking on the road, no one knows him, with a big face that looks ordinary except for a bit of masculinity. After more than 20 years, the goal of life is to be a good person, other than that, there are no characteristics-this is him.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, walking on the road against the big sun during the day can also make people feel very irritable. Therefore, all kinds of vehicles can be seen everywhere in the busy city center, but there are not many pedestrians walking outside, and the tall young man wearing a white T-shirt, gray trousers, and ordinary appearance is one of these few pedestrians.
Hao Ren feels that students these days are becoming more and more disrespectful to their careers. When he was working outside to send folding pages, he would never put this kind of thing in the hands of a man who could see at a glance that he was a bachelor, but in any case, this kind of hard folding fan is still quite suitable.
“The last two, forget it if it doesn't work."Hao Ren muttered and looked at the last two recruitment advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, these two places are next to each other. He can quickly complete today's “task”, and one of them is right in front. It is an advertising company that can never see how powerful it is from the outside, but the sign at the door is loud: Galaxy Media Pan-cultural development and promotion Company, when I heard this name, it was a must-fall product within half a year. Hao Ren came for this name at that time. The main purpose was not to apply for a job, but to see how strange the company owner who could come up with such a magical name would be.
He walked hundreds of meters with great interest before bypassing the isolation guardrail of the road, and then ran to the door of this advertising company with a particularly bullish name against the big sun. He was surprised to find that the company had indeed closed down. The signboard at the door was still hanging, but the glass door was posted with a notice of closure. The date was two days ago, and the recruitment notice in his hand was four days ago...This is really a world that is changing with each passing day. Do you have to recruit two new employees by the way two days before the company goes bankrupt these days?
He easily rubbed the recruitment notice of the advertising company into a ball and threw it into the trash can on the side of the road. Hao Ren looked down at the last copy, and two seconds later rubbed it into a ball and threw it into the same place. By the way, he reflected on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago. -The bus company recruits an office clerk, who is required to be 25 to 40 years old, can bear hardships and stand hard work, and work experience is preferred. Gender female.
He clutched this thing and came to the city center with great interest, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising company that was busy recruiting workers two days before its collapse were, and he was almost full.
Hao Ren, gender male, hobbies female, age 25 years old, no hobbies, the advantage is that he is not picky eaters. He is currently single and has few friends and family. He lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old town of Chengnan. Like most young men, his goal in life is to make a monthly income of over 10,000 at the age of 25. Marry a beautiful daughter-in-law. If you can, it's best to have a car. There is no way for parents to be filial, so at least you have to live well enough to not be ashamed of your family. Now this series of life goals has been completed one-third: he is twenty-five this year.
This is really a sad story.
He came to the city today to find a job, but in fact, he personally does not have any urgent needs for the source of life: As mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents. He should be grateful for the family business left by the older generation. At least this house is quite big-it is a two-story old-fashioned house that has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been renting out houses for a living, but because the place where he lives is so remote, he is even so remote that he might have to plan for decades if he wants to wait for the demolition of the old house.
To be sure, with this kind of stable income, Hao Ren doesn't need to come out to find any job, but this person is a bit hypocritical when he has been free for too long. He always feels that he should work a little harder to open up the path of life. In addition, there is a more important reason-his old house is too partial, and it is almost out of human civilization. Since the last migrant couple moved out of the rental house, no one has come to rent an apartment for half a year. Looking at the empty two-story “apartment” for several months in a row, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart. Matter: Unless the municipal planning is tilted towards him, I am afraid that if you want to live, you really have to come out to find a job.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought that it was unlikely that the surrounding area of his home would become a commercial center overnight. Considering that as a big master, he couldn't abandon himself, he finally decided to find a job first, at least he had an income to maintain his life.
How can you say that back then, he was also a hard-working man who worked part-time to earn tuition, could Langlang Qiankun still starve himself to death?
However, fate is not transferred by human will. Basically, he ran blindly outside this first day... there was only running blindly left.
It's useless to think so much. Hao Ren stretched out and decided to take a break under the shady benches in a small roadside park. After the hottest hour of noon, he went to a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then took the car home.
Even if the economic development is very fast, it can still maintain the leisure and openness of a small place.He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down on the ground, covered his face with the folding page with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl to block the sun, and rested so unconcernedly.
But just before he lay down for what seemed to be less than a minute, the sunlight that came in through the edge of the fold had dimmed, as if someone had come to him. Hao Ren showed his face slightly unexpectedly, and was shocked to find that the sun was already setting on the horizon, and a petite and thin female figure was standing next to him. This figure just blocked the sinking sunset. Because of the relationship against the light, the appearance of this woman could not be seen clearly, and she could only confirm that the other party was a slim girl with short hair through a dim outline.
“Yo, are you awake?”
At this time, the strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position in the backlight made people unable to see her clearly, so she grinned and turned her body slightly so that the other party could see her clearly.
A very beautiful girl-this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This girl who is familiar with herself has short shawl hair. She may like sports very much. Her skin is slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine. Her appearance is beautiful and lovely. The most eye-catching thing is the big smart eyes, which are more energetic than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen, as if the whole person's spirit must be revealed from these eyes.
Behind her, there is a large suitcase that looks quite weighty.
Looking at Hao Ren, who was in a daze, this beautiful girl with short hair burst into an unprecedented giggle (although it seems a bit inappropriate to say this, Hao Ren does think it is a giggle). That smile is clean and pure. Nowadays, it seems that it is rarely seen on the faces of girls of the same age. The other party dug hard in the small bag he carried for a long time, and finally found a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: “Excuse me, do you know where this place is?"”
Hao Ren patted his face to wake himself up, regardless of what happened to this reckless girl, but looked down at the address on the paper... Eh, isn't this my home when I go?
Chapter 1
The shimmer of the early morning pierced the ink-blue sky, and the vast sky was white with fish maw.
In Xianyu County, Wuzong Xuefu, in the back mountains and forests, a thin young man in a loose martial arts robe squatted down with his knees, the tip of his tongue against his teeth, and his whole body strength was concentrated on the left and right fists, blasting people and trees.
The boxing technique is smooth, retractable freely, the inner strength is contained without vomiting, the rigidity is soft, and there is already a bit of heat.
The boy's name is Su Yu, he is fourteen years old, handsome and handsome, with a straight posture and a childish temperament.
With his black hair lightly raised, a pair of eyes as vast as stars and as deep as the eternal starry sky showed wisdom that did not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun hung high.
Su Yu stopped boxing, looked down at the blood-stained fists, and sighed softly: “I work twice as hard as others, but the results I get are less than half of those with the best qualifications.”
“Coming to a different world, I really don't know if it's a blessing or a curse?”
Two months ago, Su Yu took a plane and unfortunately had a plane crash. When he woke up, he found that he had traveled to a world called Shenyue Continent.
Become a student of a certain Wuzong Academy in the mainland.
It took two full months for him to digest the memory of the original owner.
Shenyue Continent, with martial arts as the respect, the law of the jungle and the law of the jungle, is cruel and strict.
Human beings practice martial arts, reach the peak, and reach the realm of extraordinary sanctification.
Martial arts is divided into nine levels, each of which has three levels: Xiaocheng, Dacheng, and peak.
Surpassing the nine levels of martial arts and breaking the shackles, he jumped into a god and became a mythical figure, known as the “Holy King of the world.”
The realm of the Holy King of the world is the ultimate in martial arts, the limit pursued by hundreds of millions of human beings.
It is rumored that the holy King of the world can move mountains and reclaim the sea, ascend the clouds and drive the fog, and be omnipotent.
A holy king on earth, enough to change the luck of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to practice in the world?
Su Yu is a top genius in Qingshan Town under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At the age of only fourteen, he has cultivated to the pinnacle of martial arts and has become a century-old wizard in the minds of everyone in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was included in the Wuzong Academy in Xianyu County, which is above everything, Su Yu discovered what a frog he used to be.
Wuzong Xuefu collects all the geniuses in Xianyu County and includes them once a year.
And he, among all the geniuses in Wuzong University, is just the bottom!
Wuzong University divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden students, excellent-level geniuses, are often the best in a city, and the top geniuses who suppress the rest of the geniuses in the city will be trained by Wuzong University.
Silver students, geniuses of the potential level, have superior talents in the small town. With a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver student. He understands very well that in fact, silver students are a class of people who have no hope of cultivating to great success, but it is a pity to give up. The food is tasteless and it is a pity to abandon it. It is like chicken ribs.
Silver students are not optimistic. The cultivation resources given by the university are very limited, and the possibility of success is approaching zero.
”Su Yu, go back to Xuefu as soon as possible, and the Duke of Qin will summon you!"”An urgent voice cut through the silence of the mountains and forests, and a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain panting, with a bit of anxiety on his face.
”Can you neglect the Duke of Qin? Follow me!"The middle-aged man in blue was impatient, and stepped forward to clasp Su Yu's shoulders, regardless of the pain to Su Yu's thin body, and grabbed him quickly down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted her teeth, endured the severe pain in her shoulder, and said nothing.
The middle-aged man in blue is the deacon of the university, who manages daily student activities. In the words of the Earth School, he is the director of teaching.
After half a cup of tea.
Xuefu, a luxurious and elegant, exquisite as a dream lounge.
Only core students, senior officials of universities, and dignitaries can rest here. In addition, gold and silver students are not eligible.
This is also the first time Su Yu has come to the luxury lounge. Ordinary poor boys may be nervous when they come here.But Su Yu, in his previous life, was a business elite, a five-star hotel, a presidential suite, and a luxury dance party. He was a frequent visitor, with a quiet attitude and not surprised by humiliation.
In the lounge, there were three people, a pair of young men and women, a man with a noble temperament and extraordinary prestige.
When his gaze swept past the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu's gaze paused for a moment.
It was a woman with a pretty face like an elf, her jade face was as delicate as a carving, her skin was as white as the snow of spring, her figure was exquisite, and she was dressed in spotless white clothes, like a fox fairy, very beautiful.
It's just that the way she looked at Su Yu was cold and complicated.
Beside him, there was a sixteen-year-old boy with a heroic posture, handsome and martial, and unspeakably expensive.
”Hehe, I am the Duke of Qin, and I am very happy to meet you.”The Duke of Qin, one of the three great princes of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, did not have any arrogance, but was extremely kind, and asked Su Yu to sit down with a smile.
Su Yu shook his head coldly in his heart, not moved by the kindness at all.
Those who are in a high position have attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and their own image.
Just like politicians on earth, they are obviously incompatible with fire and water, but after meeting, they still shake hands and greet each other with a smile on their faces, only stabbing knives and black hands under the stage.
“I am Qin Feng's father. This time, I am here for him and Qing'er."Qin Guogong's handsome face showed a warm smile. “I have heard Feng'er say everything. For this, as Feng'er's father, I apologize to you."”
Bitterness flashed in Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's remnant soul. The girl in front of her, named Jiang Xueqing, is a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu, and was also included as a student of Wuzong Academy.
The two childhood sweetheart, the two little guesses, the golden boy and the jade girl, a pair made in heaven and earth.
However, after entering the Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small village in Yunnan, was shocked by the huge and prosperous world and gradually became fascinated in the flashy world.
With her fox fairy-like beauty, it is inevitable that she will be sought after by young dignitaries and Junjie geniuses.
Initially, she was able to convince herself to stick to her original intention and accompany Su Yu through the first school year.
However, gradually, she, who understood the cruelty of the world, gradually transformed from a naive little girl, knowing that it would be difficult for Su Yu to have a future in the future, and following her, she was likely to suffer and become a subordinate.
Finally, her inner line of defense was lax.
Two months ago, he completely cut off contact with Su Yu and became the son of Qin Guogong and the companion of Qin Feng, the Duke of Xiaoguo.
Although Jiang Xueqing abided by her duty as a good girl and never violated the relationship between men and women, since then, the two have often accompanied each other, inseparable, and become the envy of everyone's fairy couple.
Su Yu, on the other hand, became the laughing stock of Wuzong Xuefu.
Su Yu was hit hard, and repeatedly begged Jiang Xueqing to change her mind. She did not hesitate to kneel and beg, losing her face, but Jiang Xueqing indifferently refused.
Su Yu couldn't bear the great sorrow of his life, and threw himself into the lake to kill himself. It happened that Su Yu on the earth had a plane crash, and his soul passed through him, a sad and pitiful weak man.
Seeing Su Yu's memories, Qin Guogong only sighed when he couldn't give up his friendship with Jiang Xueqing, “Feng'er is young and ignorant. I am willing to pay compensation for his mistakes. What do you want, just mention it, but, as a father, I hope you can fulfill Feng'er. He is serious about Miss Xueqing.”
Listening to Qin Guogong's seemingly heartfelt words, Su Yu shook his head secretly in his heart. This trick is okay to deceive ordinary people, but it is useless to him.
Took away my girlfriend and let me fulfill it? Where is this to apologize, it is clearly to suppress people!
The Duke of Qin seemed to have a gentle attitude, but in fact he was full of naked insults.
Ask, if it is the monarch's woman, the emperor's woman, and is favored by his son, does he, the Duke of Qin, dare to let the monarch give his woman to Qin Feng? He didn't dare, because he couldn't afford to provoke the monarch, he could only provoke civilians like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head faintly, got up and wanted to leave. He had no nostalgia for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing. Even if the Duke of Qin didn't use his power to suppress people, he didn't plan to fight for her.
As for the so-called compensation of the Duke of Qin, although Su Yu lacked cultivation resources, although he was a poor boy, he had nothing. However, he still has a will not to lose, and he has not yet fallen to the point of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understood the character of ”Su Yu" and was stubborn and unwilling to lose. When he saw that he wanted to leave, he still refused to give up. With a gentle bite of his silver teeth, Lianbu moved lightly, and her snow eyes were like a cold moon. Youmang: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!”
“Now that it's today, I'll talk about it thoroughly, and I hope you can give up."Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed coldly.
“Qin Fenggui is the duke of a small country, and he will be the pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me glory and wealth. Can you give me a poor boy in a mountain village?"”
“Qin Feng is respected as a golden student. In the future, he will chase the holy King of the world and stand on top of hundreds of millions of people. It can give me a sense of security. Can you introduce a silver student?”
“Su Yu, accept the reality. I don't deny that you used to be my attachment and the most dazzling genius in my mind, but that was because I was too young, too simple, and the real world was cruel and real. I had no choice!”
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in her eyes, stared at Su Yu's gaze, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, and sighed softly: “Brother Feng is very nice, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Rongling Baodan, promote cultivation, your strength has improved, and your life in school will be much better.”
After thinking for a while, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
Crystal clear, shining with gorgeous and deep color. The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a heavenly fairy, so fascinating.
The appearance of the statue of a woman is lifelike, and it is the same as the owner holding it, Jiang Xueqing.
“This is a love gift you gave me. Now, I will give it back to you. We will never owe each other."Jiang Xueqing, mercilessly stuffed the statue in Su Yu's hands, turned around and returned to Qin Feng's side, looked out of the sky, stopped looking at Su Yu, cold and unfeeling.
“Chi Yao, I treat you like my love, why did you kill me?"”
Zhang Ruochen yelled, trying to jump forward, the gilt-cast bed creaked, and suddenly sat up.
Discovering that it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen took a long breath and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeves.
no!
That's not a dream!
How could everything that happened to him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of the “Ming Emperor”, one of the nine great emperors of the Kunlun Realm. At the age of sixteen, he cultivated to the great perfection of the heavenly realm with a physique against the sky.
However, when he became the first person of the younger generation in the Kunlun world, he died in the hands of his childhood sweetheart, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of “Qingdi”, one of the nine emperors.
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing were the best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao were married. They grew up together and practiced together.
One is heroic and the other is extremely beautiful. She can be called a golden girl and a jade girl. She could have become a good story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen couldn't have expected that Princess Chi Yao would actually attack him!
After dying in the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found that he was already eight hundred years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao calmed the chaos of the nine emperors, unified the nine kingdoms, established the first central empire, and became the master of the entire Kunlun realm-Queen Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the nine emperors who dominated the Kunlun Realm completely became a thing of the past and disappeared into the long river of history.
The nine emperors are dead, and the queen should be established.
In this era, there is only one emperor, and that is Queen Chi Yao, who rules the world and is mighty in all directions.
“Why did she kill me?
How can her heart be so cruel, or is it that women's hearts are so cruel?"Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart sank like iron, full of questions.However, no one can help him answer.
Eight hundred years have passed, and the vicissitudes of life have long passed. Things are different from people. Except for the peerless Queen Chi Yao, she is still young and immortal.
All the old people who used to be have turned into loess and bones. Even the nine emperors with eight mighty faces were all extinct in the world back then, leaving only a glorious story that will be recited by future generations for a long time.
“Squeak!”
A beautiful woman in palace attire with a weak body pushed the door from the outside and walked in. She looked at Zhang Ruochen sitting on the bed with concerned eyes, “Chen'er, have you had a nightmare again?"”
The beautiful woman in front of her is the princess of King Yunwu County and Zhang Ruochen's mother, Concubine Lin.
The original owner of this body, because of his infirmity and illness, died on the bed three days ago.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the young man who had died of illness back to life.
What is even more coincidental is that the original owner of this body is also called Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen first woke up, she still rejected Concubine Lin very much.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Concubine Lin was just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually discovered that Concubine Lin really cared about him in every possible way. Seeing Zhang Ruochen having nightmares and being scared to wake up, she immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room regardless of the cold. Room.
In his previous life, Zhang Ruochen had never seen his birth mother. It is said that when she was born, she passed away!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body, which actually gave him an extra mother and felt the warmth of maternal love. “Maybe she doesn't know yet, her dust child died of illness three days ago!"”
If she told her the truth, she might not be able to withstand the blow of the bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, her eyes softened, and she smiled slightly: “Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream.”
Concubine Lin, wearing a maroon hooded mink fur on her thin body, sat by Zhang Ruochen's bed, stroked Zhang Ruochen's forehead, and said worriedly: "It's been three nights. You are always awakened by nightmares. Every time you call the name ‘Chi Yao’.Who the hell is she?”
It is naturally impossible for Concubine Lin to associate the name “Chi Yao” with the queen of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Queen Chi Yao unified the Kunlun Realm and established the first Central Empire, she was known as the “Female Saint Emperor of Great Power and Virtue”. No one usually dared to mention the word “Chi Yao”.
Will commit taboos. Zhang Ruochen said, "It's nothing, mother, you heard me wrong!”
Concubine Lin sighed and said, “In the future, don't call the word "Chi Yao" directly, even in a dream. That's the queen's name.It is disrespectful to call the queen's name directly, and once someone with a heart hears it, they will be executed.”
Zhang Ruochen nodded, pinched his fingers tightly, and said with deep meaning: "Absolutely not!“
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, her heart extremely sore.
Although he was born in the house of the king of the county, he has been sickly since he was a child. He is already sixteen years old and can still only lie in bed all year round. I am afraid that this will be the only way in his life!
Outside, there was a messy sound of footsteps.
“What are you doing?
A beautiful-looking maid wanted to stop Hachioji who broke in, but was gently pushed by Hachioji and fell more than ten meters away. The Eighth Prince is a martial artist. His cultivation level has reached the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm. A single palm is enough to punch a 300-pound stone plate ten feet away, not to mention just a 110-pound maid?
With a flick of a finger, she can be bounced out.
The maid screamed and fell heavily to the ground, breaking her left arm.
Hachioji was dressed in a golden wisp, with a jade belt wrapped around his waist, strong body, slender arms, and steady steps. He walked into the Jade Palace and stared at the maid coldly, “A slave would dare to stand in the way of this prince. It's really looking for death.”
Behind Hachioji, followed by six guards wearing Linpi armor, tall and hunky, they were obviously all powerful martial arts monks, belonging to the forbidden guards of the palace.
After Lin Fei heard the movement outside and calmed Zhang Ruochen's emotions, she closed the door and walked out.
She stared at Hachioji standing outside, frowned slightly, and said, "His Royal Highness Hachioji, this is the Jade Palace. Even if you are a prince, you can't break in!”
The Eighth Prince Zhang Ji raised his head and stared at Concubine Lin, and said loudly: “The Queen has an order. The palace of Concubine Lin and the ninth brother has been changed to the ’Ziyi Side Hall'.In the future, the owner of Yuyu Palace will be the prince's birth mother, Concubine Xiao.”
Concubine Lin's face changed slightly. She had expected this day to come a long time ago, but she didn't expect it to come so soon.
Concubine Lin smiled tragically and said, “Is the queen going to drive our mother and son out of Yuyu Palace so soon?"Ok!
My mother said, she wants to settle in Yuyu Palace tonight. Please Empress Lin Fei move to the side hall now!”
Hachioji smiled coldly, and said unceremoniously: "Concubine Lin, there are so many poor people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity.Since the ninth brother is frail and sickly, what are you still doing in the world?”
“He is your ninth brother!”
Concubine Lin wanted to say something else, but suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hands on the goalpost, staring at Hachioji not far away.
His seemingly weak and windless body seemed to contain an unyielding will, and he said, "Don't beg them, we will move away now.”
“Chen'er, why did you get out of bed?The weather outside is cold, so don't go back soon."Concubine Lin hurriedly stepped forward to help Zhang Ruochen, for fear that he would get wind chill.
Lin Fei looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes, and seemed to be infected by his emotions, and nodded in tears.
Concubine Lin and Shen supported Zhang Ruochen and walked out of the Jade Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eight princes and broke her arm.
None of the other servants followed them out of Yuyu Palace. Everyone could see that Concubine Lin and the Nine Princes had completely lost their power, and it was difficult for them to gain a foothold in the county palace.
Originally, they were the servants of Yuyu Palace, but now they naturally chose wisely to stay in Yuyu Palace, and all went to please the new master of Hachioji.
Ziyi's side hall is generally the place where the princess who has fallen out of favor lives. It is very remote and full of fallen leaves. It seems that no one has lived for a long time.
The night is deep, and the cold wind is bleak.
Sitting on a cold stone stool, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, but he still felt the cold.
“This body is too weak. Only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am now the son of the king of the county, I can still only be at the mercy of others."Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen doesn't know where he can go now?
Since God arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it was for revenge on Queen Chi Yao in the future or for the mother who took care of him in every possible way, he must become stronger. The humiliation and cold treatment suffered today are all because I am too weak to resist, unable to control my own destiny, and even the place where I live has been forcibly occupied by others.
If you want to be respected by others and to obtain a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your abilities.
In the Kunlun Realm, if you want to become a warrior, you must first open the “Mark of Divine Martial Arts”.
The so-called “mark of Divine Martial arts” is the qualification given to mankind by the gods to practice martial arts.
Those who have not opened the “Mark of Divine Martial Arts” will never be able to cultivate true qi, and will not be able to become a strong man between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruochen is already sixteen years old, and he still hasn't opened the “Mark of Shenwu”.
After the age of sixteen, you miss the best age for martial arts cultivation. Even if you open the “Mark of Divine Martial Arts”, it is impossible to achieve much.
They are also the sons of King Yunwu, so why can Hachioji be superior to others?Can Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin be driven out of Yuyu Palace?
It is because Hachioji opened the “Mark of Divine Martial Arts” when he was ten years old, and he is now a young warrior in the late Huangji Realm.
“As long as I open the'shenwu Mark‘, I can practice the "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra".
With the mystery of the "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra", even if I have missed the best age of cultivation, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again.”The "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra" is the supreme treasure of the Ming Emperor's cultivation. Except for the Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra".
“Tomorrow is the sacrifice ceremony. I hope to be recognized by the gods and open the'shenwu Mark‘.”
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists, full of desire to open the “Mark of Shenwu”.
After Lin Fei cleaned up the room, she came to help Zhang Ruochen, “Chen'er, you should rest early!"Tomorrow, I will go to the sacrifice ceremony.”
“Mother, don't worry, I will definitely be able to open the'shenwu Mark‘ tomorrow!"Zhang Ruochen said.
“Hmm!
Concubine Lin glanced at Zhang Ruochen deeply, and sighed softly.
Chapter One
With a ”bang", a rusty iron door was opened, and the aftertaste of the iron door was blocked back by the surrounding ancient buildings, curling endlessly.
After more than a dozen breaths, a young man with his head drooping was dragged out of the iron gate by two jailers with his arms pulled. The young man with his head drooping seemed to be out of breath, and even his arms were thin with only bones left. It can be seen from the blood-stained and tattered clothes on his body, what kind of destruction and torture this young man has suffered.
The thin man ”tent" was thrown to the ground by two jailers, splashing some dust, and then there was no movement.
“This kid should be dead, right?”A stocky jailer stared at the young man who was lying motionless on the ground and asked.
Another jailer let out a sigh, “It should be dead, who let him not know whether he is alive or dead, dare to be rude to Miss Jane." It's better now, not only was Ningfu destroyed, but he himself was relieved and deserved it.”
“Lao Hui, be careful when you speak, let's drag him out and deal with it first.”The chunky jailer quickly warned.
Hearing what the chunky jailer said, the other jailer named Lao Hui shrank his head involuntarily, and was about to pull up the man who had no breath on the ground, ready to drag him away.
At this moment, a somewhat weak voice shouted from one side, “Two elder brothers, I want to take my husband away.”
Only then did the two talking jailers see a woman wearing coarse cloth and linen clothes standing on the side. Although this woman was wearing coarse cloth and linen clothes, she could still vaguely see her good demeanor. The only regret is that her face is disfigured and covered by slightly messy hair, making people reluctant to take a second look.
Both jailers recognized who this woman was, and this was one of the only two living members of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the housekeeper of Ningfu. When Ningfu was copied from his house, he left Cang Qin to go out and have something to do, so he escaped. And this woman is the daughter-in-law of Ningfu, and the wife of the thin man who has just been thrown out of prison, named Ji Luofei.
She escaped because she stayed in Cangqin Two-star Academy. Of course, this is also because Concubine Ji Luo is not closely related to the Ning family. The reason why she married into the Ning family is because the Ning family and the Ji family are world friends, and she and Ningcheng have been close since childhood. It's just that the Ji family failed in the most inexplicable way, and in the end only one disfigured Concubine Ji Luo was left.
Even so, Ning Hongchang, Ningcheng's grandfather, still accepted Concubine Ji Luo into the mansion. Prepare to wait for Ningcheng to really gather strength before letting the two get married.
“Okay, okay, drag it away, it's so ugly to put it here.”The chunky jailer put away the silver coins and waved his hand impatiently.
They were going to deal with Ningcheng's body, but they didn't expect someone to come and deal with it, and they returned the silver coins. Of course, they would not refuse this kind of good thing.
When Ji Luofei heard this, she hurriedly carried Ningcheng up, accelerated her speed, and soon disappeared from the entrance of the prison.
“If this Concubine Ji Luo hadn't been disfigured, she would also be a beautiful embryo."Looking at Ji Luofei's back, another jailer threw the silver coin in his hand and said in a critical tone.
“Stop talking nonsense, then Ji Luofei is also from Cangqin Two-star Academy anyway, no matter how ugly it is, it's not our turn.”The chunky jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder and led him into the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled an extremely good fragrance, and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaoxiao reacted. He was carried by a woman, and the fragrance came from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood. As a result, he went the wrong way and walked to the elevated by himself. Then a yellow light from the horizon hit him, and then there was no more.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? What the hell is going on?
As soon as Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, all kinds of information rushed into his mind, and he was reborn.
What shocked Ning Chengxiao was that the body he was reborn was originally called Ning Cheng. The reason why he was horrified was because his original name was also Ningcheng.
It's just because he often has a nightmare, that is, he saw himself in a very strange place, being secretly imprisoned in a prison, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ningcheng still changed his name to Ningcheng Town.
Unexpectedly, he still called Ningcheng around, and he was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaoxiao wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman carrying him glanced back and didn't say much.
“Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk."Seeing this woman looking back at herself, Ning Xiaoxiao said apologetically.
“The Ning family is gone, you are lucky to be alive.”The woman's tone was calm, and it seemed that even if Ning Xiaocheng was really dead, she had this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaoxiao fell silent, he had already sorted out some piecemeal information just now. He should now be called back to Ningcheng again, and he is the duding of the Ning family of the Cang Qin Kingdom.
Ningcheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to look for spiritual objects when Ningcheng was very young, and then never came back. Ningcheng has been living with his grandfather Ning Hongchang in Cangle City, the capital of the Cang Qin Kingdom. Although Ningfu is large, there are not many people.
Of course, Ningcheng also became the first person in Ningfu, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ningcheng. All the bad things Ningcheng did in Cangle City were borne by Ning Hongchang. Cangle City is full of princes and nobles. Although Ning Hongchang is also a veteran of the Cangqin Kingdom, he is still a bit worse than those princes and nobles.
Finally one day, Ningcheng got into a basket that even he couldn't afford. He actually offended Jian Sujie, the jewel in the palm of the Jian family in the State of Qin. Not to mention that the Jian family was something that the Ning family couldn't afford, even Jian Sujie's fiancé Qiu Yingguang, and the Ning family couldn't afford it either.
Ning Cheng thought of this and sighed. The result he couldn't afford was, of course, that he was put in jail. In order to protect him, his grandfather Ning Hongchang exhausted his contacts and family wealth. As a result, he was not rescued. Instead, he put the entire Ning family in. This news was learned by his predecessor from the jailer, and it can be said that the Ning family was also destroyed because of him.
After Ning Cheng sorted out these things clearly, he sighed again in his heart. There is no truth in this world. Whoever has a big fist is the truth.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was. This disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luofei, which was somewhat similar to a child bride on earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably fell, leaving only a disfigured Concubine Ji Luo. However, Ningcheng's grandfather Ning Hongchang still took Ji Luofei to Ning's house, ready to help the two get married after Ningcheng gathered strength.
Ning Hongchang condoned Ningcheng in other matters, but he would never budge in the matter of marrying Concubine Ji Luo. It turned out that Ningcheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Concubine Ji Luo, and she often scolded if she had to fight. Fortunately, Concubine Ji Luo was obedient and would never refute Ningcheng. Moreover, Concubine Ji Luofei is different from Ningcheng, she is qualified and can practice.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Cangqin Two-star Academy, and he was already a monk on the third floor of Qi gathering. In the Cangqin Kingdom, anyone who can practice is called a monk.
At this time, Ji Luofei had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the blackstone house is low, the area is not very small, at least there should be some. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well in the courtyard.
Even if it was related to himself, Ningcheng had to figure this out. Although he guessed that it was the Jian family and the Qiu family, he had to ask clearly.
“Why do you have to ask me what you did by yourself?"Ji Luofei replied simply, and then let Ningcheng down.
After speaking, she poured another glass of water and fed it to Ningcheng, and then said, “I'll boil water and take a bath for you. Forget about some things. You know it's not good for you.”
Ning Cheng watched Ji Luofei go in to boil water, but did not continue to ask, he understood what Ji Luofei meant. With his ability, the more he knows, the faster he will die.
I don't know if Ji Luofei added something to that glass of water. Ningcheng felt that after drinking this glass of water, her whole body had regained some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden couch, thinking of his current situation in his mind for a while, and then of his sister Ning Ruolan for a while. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muwan treated him like that. According to his understanding of Tian Muwan, Tian Muwan was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li drove a boat on the lake, the lake breeze was refreshing and refreshing.
Yiguo Mansion is a vast lake with ninety-nine islands. The Yanwu Hall he is going to is eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the boat, he was of medium stature, wearing a fluttering green shirt, and his appearance was ordinary but heroic. Looking at the vast lake, his thoughts floated away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days have passed!
A dignified researcher in high-energy physics, a promising academic, and a future great scientist, a small mistake in the experiment, exploded and came to this world, reincarnated and became a new person!
"Boom!"The muffled sound broke his contemplation, and he turned to see a glittering carp beating on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head and bent over to throw the carp back into the lake. Straight up, a high-rise building greeted him.
The 100-meter high-rise building, flashing bronze light, is heavy and solemn, showing the majesty of the national palace.
This bronze high-rise building is the Yanwu Hall!
In front of the Yanwu Hall is an open martial arts field, paved with red clay, hundreds of people are practicing, or practicing swords, fists, palms, or learning from each other. It is very lively.
Chu Li leaned ashore on the boat and set foot on the martial arts training ground. After a few steps, a handsome young man suddenly flashed out, his face like a jade crown, his eyebrows like a sword, and his spirits were high.
He was tall and tall, with a tall head, holding his shoulders and looking down at him: "My surname is Chu, what are you doing here?" ！”
Chu Li frowned: "Get out of the way, the good dog won't get in the way!”
The handsome young man smiled and said, “Is it possible that you want to practice martial arts?”
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued to walk forward: "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed. Believe it or not, you are going to be unable to eat and leave?”
The guards of the mansion prohibit private fighting and are not allowed to kill each other. The guards of the mansion are divided into guards and guards, one martial art and one writing. In particular, private fighting is strictly prohibited between the two. If it is light, it will be downgraded, and if it is heavy, it will be expelled from the mansion.
Chu Li was an unopened guard, while Zhuo Feiyang was an eight-rank guard. It was taboo for the guard to do anything to the guard. He fell to the ground and screamed, and Zhuo Feiyang would be severely punished no matter how talented he was.
Zhuo Feiyang frowned with a sword: “The surname Chu, okay, shameless enough!"Chu Li continued to move forward.
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside sideways, with a gloomy face: “Surnamed Chu, you can only use these small methods!”
Chu Li smiled and said, “Small means are enough to deal with you idiot like you!”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, his fists clenched tighter and tighter, as if he would wave it out the next moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly smiled brightly and raised her hand vigorously: “Sister Zhao!”
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl came curled up, her skin was snowy, her apricot eyes and willow eyebrows, her temperament was clear, and she was as gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly, and Zhao Ying, who entered the mansion with them at the same time, was beautiful, kind, and gentle. She was the kind of woman that men would like when they saw her.
“Brother Zhuo? Zhao Ying walked over lightly and said in surprise, "Brother Chu?"”
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought and smiled: “Sister Zhao, it's been a long time since I saw you.”
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he has been to the library most of the time, wanting to use knowledge to change his destiny, and he has rarely come to the Martial Arts Hall.
This time I came to Yanwudian, I encountered a problem in cultivating Xiaozhimai Jue. I want to take a look at the secrets and practice notes related to Xiaozhimai Jue.
Zhao Ying smiled and said, "Brother Chu, congratulations, Dongyuan Garden is a beautiful job.”
Chu Li smiled and nodded: “Not bad.”
Dongyuan Garden is directly under the Yuqi Island of the Third Lady Xiao Qi. Only he and Li Yue are the guards. Not only are they leisurely, they also have the opportunity to see the third lady. Once the third lady has blue eyes, Feihuang is just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath. This guy was so lucky that he actually entered the East Garden. God was too unkind, so he had to clean him up!
“Sister Zhao, don't worry about this waste. I just practiced broken swordsmanship yesterday. Let's learn from it?”
Zhao Ying frowned, feeling that Zhuo Feiyang was speaking badly.
“Well, don't talk about him as a waste! Zhuo Feiyang smiled hurriedly, and glanced at Chu Li: "Even though he is a waste!"”
Zhao Ying's eyes widened in dissatisfaction.
“Sister Zhao, it's okay,” Chu Li said with a smile: “There is no need to care about such an arrogant idiot.”
“Brother Chu!"Zhao Ying said angrily.
Chu Li stretched out his hand to make a surrender: “Sister Zhao, come and play in the East Garden. The scenery is beautiful and Brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent.”
“Huh, what's there to see!"Zhuo Feiyang curled his lips: “It's just flowers and plants. It's better to practice martial arts and play with things when you have that time!"”According to you, the third lady and the eldest son are both playthings, so why don't you?""Chu Li seemed to be smiling, the West Garden belonged to the eldest son Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang's face flushed, sneered again and again, and decided not to bicker with him.
“Brother Zhuo!Brother Chu!"Zhao Ying said angrily dissatisfied: "Will you stop for a while?" …...Brother Chu, I will go over to play, so if you have something to do, just get busy first.”
Chu Li glanced at her deeply: “Senior Sister Zhao, someone has a good skin, and it takes a long time to see people's hearts. Senior sister, don't trust others easily!”
“The surname is Chu, what do you mean!”
Chu Li ignored him and smiled at Zhao Ying and hugged him.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy to keep up, and before leaving, while Zhao Ying was not paying attention, he suddenly stretched out his hand.
He slapped Chu Li almost on the face, very confident that Chu Li had no time to avoid it. He seemed not to pay attention, but he used his internal strength and was extremely fast.
Chu Li gently tilted his head, Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips passed against his cheeks, and he could feel the breeze. The power of this palm was not light.
“Pop!”
A crisp and loud slap in the face sounded.
Chu Li patted his left palm on his face, crisp and loud, with little force, his voice was very loud, and then quickly stopped.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned her head to look.Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if the palm was not hit on his face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him gloomily.Chu Li smiled and touched his face: "It's really good kung fu, admire it!”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him.
“Brother Zhuo--!"Zhao Ying sank her jade face.
“I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it. Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, squeezed his voice out of his teeth, and said coldly: "I'm sure Junior Brother Chu won't care, right, Junior Brother Chu?"”
Chu Li turned his head and smiled: “Sister Zhao, forget it.”
Zhao Ying looked at him embarrassedly, and hurriedly dragged Zhuo Feiyang away. If she stayed any longer, the two had to fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back motionless, touched her fiery left face, activated the big round mirror, and suppressed the fluctuations in her mood.
If it weren't for Da Yuan Jingzhi, he would inevitably be plotted by Zhuo Feiyang!
The world respects Wu, and the concept of being deeply rooted in his heart since he was a child, Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, protecting herself in the dark, which makes him quite moved.
But as a man, he needs a woman to protect him. As a man, he really can't bear it!
He passed through the crowd on the martial arts training ground and entered the Martial arts Hall.
Untie the wooden sign at the waist and hand it to the young man in front of the hall. The young man glanced at him like electricity, indicating that he could enter.
In front of him were rows of bookshelves. He walked in confidence, stopped by chance, stretched out his hand and pulled out a book, quickly flipped it over, put it back and continued walking, stopped again, and pulled out another book and flipped it over again.
In one hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
It seems that he knew the location of these books a long time ago, so he just went over and took them out. In fact, it was the first time he came here. Xiao Zimaijue read them in the library.
The entire Yanwu Hall was presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of each book, was clear and vivid.
He stepped to the second floor and went directly to the third row of bookshelves. On the second floor, he took out the Broken Sword spectrum, turned it over, and then took out seven secret books. This is the practice experience of the Broken Sword spectrum.
When he left the Yanwu Hall, he had already imprinted thirty secret secrets in his mind, twenty-two small pulse-washing technique practice notes, one broken delusion sword spectrum, and seven broken Delusion sword practice experience.
He drove a small boat on the lake, the breeze was blowing, and the original raging anger had dissipated.
Thirty secrets in my mind began to be mastered.
The noon sun was scorching, and he sailed back to Dongyuan.
The East Garden is a small island with a radius of two miles, divided into flower beds, each with a rare flower, and the whole island is floating with the fragrance of flowers.
There was only one small courtyard on the island. Chu Li pushed the door into the courtyard, and the cool air was blowing on his face. A big tree covered half of the courtyard and drove away the heat.
He entered the west wing, brought out a Qingfeng sword, and waved it in the center of the courtyard, as slowly as a Tai Chi sword. After a while, a layer of sweat appeared and his forehead brightened.
He never forgot it, and the secrets he had read were imprinted in his mind all over again. The broken swordsmanship he had just learned from the Yanwu Temple was really powerful, but it was also extremely labor-intensive.
"Squeak..." A sturdy young man walked out of the main hall, with a big round face and small eyes.
He staggered like a black bear, stretched out his waist for a long time, and yawned twice before speaking lazily: "Brother, are you back so early?"”
Chu Li focused on sword practice and only let out a sigh. Li Yue, the nine-pin guard, the two of them are in charge of the East Garden together. They have a good appetite, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts, but they are afraid of death and do not break into the nine-pin building. They are willing to be guards.
The guards and guards of the state mansion are divided into nine grades, and the wages are ten times worse.
The guards are paid less, and the grades have to be qualified, nine grades in three years, eight grades in ten years, seven grades in twenty years, six grades in forty years, and five grades in seventy years. Regardless of the guard's promotion, the others only look at martial arts, break into the nine-product building, and pass through the first floor to upgrade to one product.
With a lot of wages, he can often go out of the house to do tasks, and live a colorful life. Unlike guards, he can only stay in the house and serve people, but anyone who is capable of it can be used as a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched out his legs, his joints crackled, and then he swung his fists to practice, fists like meteors, whirling wind.
“Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me!”
Chu Li spit out two words, a layer of soy sweat on his forehead.
Martial arts is prosperous in this world, and martial arts practice starts from the doll.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are set, no matter how magical the mind is, it will take several times as long to build the foundation.
Before he was eighteen years old, he missed building the foundation in the original Sutra of Sophora Dajidu at Akiha Temple, where he grew up. The spirit is twice that of ordinary people, and the spirit is tyrannical.
In addition, he was a researcher in high-energy physics in his previous life, and his understanding of the world is far from comparable.
When the two were combined, he finally practiced the origin Sutra of Great Wisdom and achieved the magical power of Great Round Mirror wisdom.
The spirit is tyrannical, his cultivation duration is far longer than that of ordinary people, his supernatural powers are in the body, and he observes in detail. Therefore, his small pulse washing technique is progressing very quickly, and the foundation can be built in five years.
“Hehe..., with your sword, the chicken can't be killed. What else do you practice?”
Chu Li suddenly closed his sword and hummed, “Bibi?”
He was panting, his whole body was soft, and he leaned his sword on the ground before he could hold on to his body. Breaking the illusion of swordsmanship was too physically exhausting.
1.Chapter 1
In the ancient and ancient room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces!
As soon as the hand fell, an electric shock-like pain came, and there was a burst of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
There was a gentle female voice in his ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face and was looking at him with care.
This is a classical beauty, so suffocating in beauty, she can be described as leaning towards the country and the city.
Ling Tian, a Chinese national.
He served in the most outstanding Wolf Tooth special Operations forces in China. During his service, he made countless achievements.
He has participated in world-class special forces competitions, won the personal honor of the first individual combat ability, and is recognized as the ‘King of Soldiers’!
Later, in a multinational SSS-level mission, a comrade-in-arms died because of a small personal mistake.
Under self-blame, he chose to retire and left the wolf Tooth.
After retiring, he was silent for a period of time, chose to go abroad, and became the ace of one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it is his mission, the success rate is 100% unprecedented!
Although he has retired from the Wolf Tooth for many years, he still cares about China.
As long as it is a task that is unfavorable to China, not only will he not take it, but he will also find out the person who issued the task and carry out inhumane killings.
Over time, he has become a thorn in the eyes and a thorn in the flesh of countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a time bomb.
However, as one killer after another disappeared from the world, Ling Tian became more alive and nourished, and no killer dared to take this ‘death mission’.
Killing Ling Tian is tantamount to killing oneself.This is a sentence recognized by the world mercenary and killer circles.
Looking at the earth, it is rare to meet an enemy and never lose!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted broker.
Country R has created a colorless and odorless biological and chemical weapon, intending to be shipped into China to carry out a terrible conspiracy.
In this regard, of course Ling Tian will not sit idly by.
He made a move!
With the help of the agent, the location of the biological and chemical weapons was found.
Just when he killed a bloody path and entered the underground research room, preparing to destroy the batch of biological and chemical weapons. The underground research room suddenly sank, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When I saw a group of R people holding various firearms, they appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian understood.
I was betrayed by the person I trusted most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the conspiracy of the R people will not succeed.
Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out until he was shot to death by random gunfire.
“Oh my god, what's wrong with you, don't scare your mother.”
A gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was extremely sure that he did not know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at her loved ones, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
Just when Ling Tian was about to have a theory with this beautiful woman.
Ling Tian was completely stunned as if he had been struck by lightning, as if he had been hit by a hole.
The only thing that satisfies Ling Tian is that this guy is also called Ling Tian, and his full name is 'Duan Lingtian’.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old.
A child surnamed Li's family in Qingfeng Town.
His mother, "Li Rou’, is the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father... in his memory, there is no father at all.
In the process of fusing this strange memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Lingtian was seriously injured lying on the bed.
Early this morning, the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family,'li Xin‘, scolded Duan Lingtian for being a wild species that had a mother and no father to teach.
It's just that he, who hadn't even completed the quenching body, how could he be the opponent of Li Xin, who had the second-level quenching body, and was directly seriously injured by Li Xin and was dying.
After fusing all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian is him.
“Madam, the patriarch asked someone to deliver the medicine.”
There was a sound in his ears, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A maid hurriedly walked in from outside the room and handed Li Rou the exquisite box in her hand.
The box was opened. Suddenly, the fragrance of medicine drifted away.
“My god, come on, take the pill, and my mother will heal you.”
Li Rou took out a black pill from the inside and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The pill melted in his mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold air stream passed into his body, turning the warm current of the pill into a healing current for him.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that most of the soreness in his body had disappeared, and there was no burden.
Is the elixir he just took an elixir?
At this time, Duan Lingtian found that Li Rou's face was pale and his forehead was still sweating, obviously expending a lot of energy for his healing.
“Mother, are you okay?”
Duan Lingtian's heart warmed.
This "mother’ is called kindly, and there is nothing unnatural about it.
“My mother is fine, just take a break.”
Li Rou smiled and shook her head.
For the sake of his son, it is nothing to consume this energy.
“He and the seven elders are still waiting in the criminal court."Half an hour later, the maid walked into the room again and said softly.
“Let it go?Go and tell the person sent by the patriarch that I will deal with this matter in person.”
The amiability on Li Rou's face disappeared, with a cold face.
“Mother, what pill did you give me just now? I feel that my injury is almost healed.”
Duan Ling got out of bed and stretched his body slightly.
“That's ‘Eight-pin Jinchuang Pill’.”
It turned out that even in the Li family of Qingfeng Town, there were only two of these eight-pin Jinchuang pills, but now one is actually used on his child with a foreign surname.
Obviously, his mother's status in the Li family is not low.
“My god, the patriarch is still waiting, let's go over.”
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and came to a spacious courtyard of the Li family mansion.
This is where the Li family enforces family law. Criminal court!
It was noon, and the scorching sun was in the sky.
The criminal court was full of people standing around, all the children of the Li family watching the excitement.
In the courtyard, a young man was tied to Xingzhu and exposed to the sun, and two middle-aged people stood beside him.
The cross-eyed middle-aged man on the right looked angry when he saw Duan Lingtian's mother and son.
“Duan Lingtian is also here... The eight-product Jinchuang Pill treasured by the family is really effective!”Yes, I also saw Duan Lingtian when he was carried back, half dead or alive.”
“So is Li Xin. It's okay to bully Duan Lingtian casually. The nine elders won't say anything, but this time he made such a heavy hand and almost killed Duan Lingtian. It's no wonder that the nine elders didn't get mad.”
One by one, the children of the Li family whispered when they saw the arrival of Duan Lingtian, the leader of the Li family.
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
“Elder Nine, my son Li Xin was wrong about today's incident, but now that your son has nothing to do, my son has also been exposed to the sun all morning, can he be put down?”
At this moment, the cross-eyed middle-aged man, the seventh elder of the Li family, "Li Kun", looked gloomy.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't pay attention to him at all.
Instead, he took Duan Lingtian to Li Xin, who was tied up.
“My god, how did he hurt you in the morning, now, you will return it all to him!"Chapter 1
When Gu Gujiu woke up, he found a terrible problem. She didn't know the surrounding environment at all!
Looking out through the gap in the cloister, there was a moon hanging in the air, the sky was full of bright stars, and she was lying on her side and being carried forward.
She was a little confused, couldn't help but move, and then found a more terrible problem-she was naked!She was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, with only a pair of eyes exposed.
Her cold gaze first fell on the two big men carrying her.
Kong Wu is powerful, his muscles are knotted, and he is dressed as a samurai in ancient costume. Although he is walking with a person on his back, he is silent. At first glance, he looks like a practicing family member, and his martial arts skills are not low.
Gu Yanjiu's fingers in the quilt tightened tightly!
She is the king of modern killers, ruthless and ruthless, all over the world, but she didn't expect to encounter the conspiracy of the most trusted person. That person's name is Long Xi, who was her former instructor and doctor. She doesn't believe in anyone, only believes in him, even likes him, and wants to marry him.
She was already dead, but she didn't expect to find Hades for tea, but she came here inexplicably.
At this time, she naturally didn't think she was at some shooting base.
She crossed!
Crossing over to this body, he was wrapped like a zongzi and carried to a rather luxurious hall.
“Ah...... Ah...... Help...... Help...... Ah, Ah, don't......” Women's delicate painful screams instantly came out, and brings back sparing nine every now and then thoughts.Her gaze swept quickly, condensing slightly! The furnishings in the hall are naturally beautiful, whether it is red sandalwood tables and chairs, or tortoiseshell screens of flowers and birds, all show two words-Haogui!
The man above has a handsome face, twenty-seven or eight years old, with long hair pinned with a jade hairpin, scattered randomly on his shoulders, smooth muscle texture, strong and powerful in one-step movements, the corners of his lips are slightly pursed, and there is a hint of a cold smile. He can be regarded as a cool and handsome hunk.
Below is a young girl. She looks very young and has beautiful eyebrows. She is different from the man's expression of enjoyment. The little girl's face is pale, her mouth is slightly open, her throat is already dumb, she is crying, and the cold sweat has drenched her hair, obviously the pain is extreme. Gu Yanjiu's face changed slightly!
This bastard, strong x seedling! Who exactly is he?
The two big men came in carrying Gu Gujiu, but they didn't disturb the man's good interest. His movements were faster and fiercer!
The little girl finally couldn't help it, she screamed a few times in a dullness, her eyes rolled, her head tilted, and she didn't move.
“Disappointment!”The man cursed in a low voice, turned over, got off the girl, took advantage of the situation, and kicked the girl out of the bed like garbage.
The girl couldn't move, her face had turned waxy yellow, and blood was flowing down the corners of her lips. I don't know if it's dead or alive.
“This is too useless, take it to the mass grave to feed the dogs!"”The man's tone was full of resentment of desire and dissatisfaction.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagpole City, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona and the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. It is adjacent to the casino city of Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Grand Canyon of Colorado can be seen to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of Colorado, and Las Vegas. Many Chinese have heard of these four names, but there are probably not many people who know the flagpole City that is wrapped in the middle of these four regions.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of the ‘not many’ until he came to study in Flagpole City.
Flagpole City is not well-known in China, and it is not well-known in the United States, but there are indeed several good universities, such as the University of Arizona and Flagstaff American College.
The school where Li Du studied is called Flagstaff National College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but there is a big difference between these two words!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American College. It is a very good private university that provides undergraduate, specialist, preparatory and other educational work.
This is a pheasant University, and Li Du was completely fooled into going to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid in the first half of the year. The school was sealed up. The school board and the admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving a group of international students with confused faces. The police drove them out of school.
Li Du was lucky. Because the school accommodation was too chaotic, he didn't have a dormitory for meditation and study. Instead, he found an apartment to rent. Now, anyway, there is a place to stay. His classmates who have paid the accommodation fee to live in the school will be wandering the streets.
However, his situation is not much better than that of his classmates. It is the end of January and his rent has expired. If he does not make up the rent in time, he may have to live on the streets.
It's tragic that he will have no money on him this time!
Of course, he can ask his parents and classmates and friends in China to borrow money, but there is a premise that he is studying abroad. Now that the school is banned, he will definitely not be able to study as a graduate student. Where can he still ask his elderly parents for money? As for finding classmates and friends?
Sitting at the door of the small building with a sad face, the pine room door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blond girl poked her head out: "Hi, Li, are you here?”
This girl is his landlord, named Hannah Fox. The house is the inheritance of her parents who died in a car accident and belongs to her and her brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be ‘busy with big business’ and would not come to live for a few days a year. The empty bedroom was rented out by Hannah to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du got up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, can I help you?"”
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear vortex appeared on her beautiful face: “When I was cleaning the refrigerator just now, I saw a few cans of beer. It must have been left by Hans. I remember you like wort beer, why don't you drink it?”
She was carrying half a dozen or six bottles of beer in her hand, packaged in a very common wooden box with a very obvious Budweiser LOGO on it.
Seeing these beer, Li Du also smiled. There is only a small refrigerator in the apartment. He opens and closes it every day. How can there be any beer in it?
Besides, with Hans's temper, if there is really beer, he will definitely not stay. This guy is addicted to alcohol.
According to his guess, this beer was bought by Hannah to comfort him. After learning that their school had been sealed, Hannah had comforted him many times, which moved him very much.
However, Hannah didn't have many routines to comfort him, either giving him an inspirational book or giving him beer.
This American girl once asked him to understand Chinese culture and learned the saying "One drunk solves a thousand worries". She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping can relieve her sorrow, so she gave him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness and owed this girl a favor. In American society, some gifts cannot be rejected, otherwise they will be misunderstood and rejected. He cherishes his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, Hannah left with a smile, and said before leaving: "There are many problems in life, but it's still beautiful.”
After reciting this American slang several times, Li Du opened the package and wanted to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, an amber-like crystal suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a ‘click’.
The crystal was about the size of his thumb, and it fell heavily on the cement floor, with several cracks appearing on it.
The reason why he guessed that this was amber was because it was light yellow in color and contained a small insect, which was very similar to an amber he had seen in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, their textbook had a text called "Amber", and when the Chinese teacher gave them class, they brought an amber.
This crystal reminded him of some good times in his childhood. He remembered that the teacher said at that time that amber with bugs was very precious. It's a pity that this one has already cracked, which makes him very sorry, otherwise he might not be able to change his living expenses for two months if he sells it.
The crystal fell very badly, and it had already broken after he picked it up, and the purple bugs wrapped in it were exposed.
The shape of the insect is similar to a locust. It is about two centimeters in length. It has a weird shape and has locust-like compound eyes. However, it has only two legs under its belly, strange lines on its legs, and no wings on its back. It looks very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug before, and he raised it up strangely to see clearly.
At this moment, something treacherous happened: the worm's claws suddenly moved, then quickly regained their vitality, twisting his body to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the bug jumped into the palm of his hand, hung his head down, and slowly, little by little, it penetrated into the palm of his hand!
Li Du was scared to pee, he really wanted to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled into the house and shouted, “Hannah, call 911!" Help, a bug got into my hand!”
It is estimated that his screams were too harsh, and Hannah's expression was panicked when she came out: "What? What bug?”
Li Du spread out his hand to show her: “This is it, this bug in my palm!”
Hannah's face was blank: “The bug in your palm? How can there be bugs in your palm?”
Not only was there a bug, but the bug was still moving. After it penetrated into the palm of Li Du's hand, it seemed unwilling to be lonely. This time it would drill out again, and half of its body came out.
Li Du pointed to the bug that was drilling out and said in horror: "This, this, the purple locust, can't you see it?"”
Li Du interrupted her and shouted, “I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah!”
“Chet, this bug has come out again!"”
Just as he was screaming hoarsely, the bug slowly got out of his skin and jumped to the ground, leaned up his upper body and supported it with his legs, and walked on the ground like a human.
It just so happened that there was a drain next to where it landed. The bug walked over without paying attention and fell down.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, "That's great, the bug fell into the drain.”
Subconsciously, an idea appeared in his heart, that is, what is in the drain? Will there be sewage and drown the bug?
However, an unbelievable scene happened to him!
Chapter One
The land of China, the Northern Desert.
The snow and ice wreaked havoc on the entire land, the reckless mountains, thousands of ditches and gullies were all wrapped in silver, and the goose feather snow fell rustleingly, looking at the sky and the earth from a distance.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan was resting. The wind and snow were too heavy, and it was difficult for the carriage to walk. I had to wait for the wind and snow to be lighter before going on the road.
“Look, the coffin puller!”
The exclamation of a middle-aged man caught the attention of everyone in the caravan. A group of people looked up curiously and looked into the distance. After only a few glances, they were all shocked physically and mentally!
The sky was roaring with wind and snow, the world became misty, and a mysterious golden ancient coffin in the distant mountain road was looming, gradually appearing in everyone's vision.
The golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the wall of the coffin was engraved with quaint patterns and runes. The graphic runes exuded a faint light, isolating all the falling snowflakes, which was extremely weird.
What shocked everyone was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a teenager who looked only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was naked, with his back bowed, grasping two giant cold iron chains with both hands, carrying the iron chains on his shoulders, and struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
In the ice and snow, the boy pulls the coffin!
This picture is very visually impactful and breathtaking. The faint light emitted from the golden ancient coffin behind reflected the young man's body a little blurred, and his face could not be seen clearly. In a trance, everyone seemed to see a god pulling the coffin.
“This young man is born with supernatural power.”
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people looked at the young man carefully, making sure that there was no mysterious light shining on him, and they were moved again.
There are three or four hundred catties of ordinary willow coffins, and the whole body of this ancient coffin is cast in gold, not to mention at least three thousand catties or more.
If a young man has no profound power, he is not a real warrior, even a powerful man has only five or six hundred catties of great power. The young man alone can pull a 3,000-pound ancient coffin. Although it looks a bit laborious, it is shocking enough.
“At a young age, he is quite handsome, and he actually came to pull the coffin. Does this young man want to be unlucky for the rest of his life?"”
An old man felt emotional, and many people nodded in agreement. Although the coffin pulling is not common, it has happened occasionally in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knows a little bit about it.
After an important patriarch of the Beimo family died, he liked to be buried in a golden coffin. These giant coffins will not be buried under the soil, but placed on the top of the iceberg, so that it is said to protect the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters a major accident, the family will hold a coffin-pulling ceremony, looking for a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffin in the family, replace feng shui, and recast the well-being of the family.
This led to the appearance of the coffin puller.
Pulling the coffin is a matter of bad luck. In the hearts of many Beimo people, when pulling the coffin, their own luck will be absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body's essence and Yangshou will also be absorbed, and they will be unlucky or sick for a lifetime.
Therefore, pulling the coffin is the most humble profession in Beimo. Even if the commission given is high, the young warriors will not be moved. Only the elderly warriors will pull the coffin.
The teenager's facial features are peugeot, he is about 1.75 meters tall, with wide shoulders and narrow waist, slender legs, and muscles. Wearing a quaint animal tooth on his neck, he looks wild, and it is very good in terms of appearance alone.
At the age of fourteen or fifteen, he has a handsome appearance and a terrifying supernatural power. The condition of the teenager is not bad. But come to do this kind of the most despicable coffin-pulling job?
“He is not afraid that his luck will be taken away, his Yangshou will be greatly reduced, and he will be unlucky for a lifetime?"The middle-aged man stared at the golden ancient coffin for a few glances, and said in relief: “This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family?" That's right, I heard that the Liu family has recently suffered a big change and has offered a sky-high price.”
"Silence, the Liu family is here.”An old man said suddenly, and everyone in the caravan quickly shut up and looked into the distance.
Whoops!
There were howls of beasts in the distance, and a team of warriors wearing black armor and riding silver giant wolves rushed forward, and the fierce aura of the giant wolf came on their faces before they got close to it.
“The Silver Wolf Guard is really a warrior of the Liu family.”
Everyone nodded secretly. There was only one army riding a silver wolf in a radius of thousands of miles near Wuling City. That was the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the boy. A middle-aged giant man in the front, holding a long whip, looked at the boy and shouted coldly: "Lu Li, hurry up! If you don't pull to Black Eagle Ridge before dark, you won't be paid.”
The young man known as Lu Li glanced up and was surrounded by more than a dozen huge silver wolves one meter high and two meters long. He didn't have much fear. He nodded and said, “Don't worry, my lord. I will definitely arrive before dark."”
The giant man let out a deep sigh, galloped away with the Silver Wolf Guard, and quickly disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan staying nearby, and continued to pull the coffin forward in silence. He grasped the giant cold iron chain with both hands and carried it on his shoulders. Every step he took was extremely difficult, and his muscles trembled all over his body. Nevertheless, his footsteps did not stop, and he quickly crossed the caravan and walked into the distance.
“It's really heavy!”
After traveling for a few miles, Lu Li stopped after ascending a steep slope. He was so tired that he was panting, but he was sweating profusely in such a cold weather. It is conceivable that his physical exertion was so great.
He thought about taking a break for a while. After placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a stone and took out water and dried meat from the sack behind him, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
It should be there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat, he looked at the sky for a while, his eyes quickly became brighter, and he said to himself: "You can change a pill by pulling a coffin. I wonder if the Liu family's quenched body pill is really like the legend, one can increase the power of five hundred catties?”
“If I can really increase my strength by 500 catties, I now have 3,000 catties of strength, and I can reach 10,000 catties of strength by pulling more than a dozen coffins, and I can... awaken my bloodline!”
“See who in the tribe dares to bully my sister? Hehe, I will be able to live a good life with my sister soon.”
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face radiated with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward. This time, his steps were more steady and fast.
Rustle!
After walking for a few miles, a voice sounded from behind, and Lu Li glanced back, his face slightly sad.
There is also a curator in the rear, but it is an old man. The old man's hand holding the iron chain was lit with white light, and there was also a faint white light flowing on his feet.
Lu Li murmured enviously, Bai Guangguang had the mysterious power that a martial artist has. The power of a warrior with Xuanli will increase a lot. The old man used Xuanli to walk like a fly and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lu Li, he glanced at him, frowned and said, "Young man, why are you pulling the coffin too?" This will damage luck.”
Lu Li smiled slightly and said nothing. The old man glanced at him a few times, then quickly pulled the coffin away without saying more.
“If the bloodline can no longer be awakened, what future is there at all? Only a lifetime of mediocrity and toil, being bullied every day, and even my sister suffered.”
“No, this is not the life I want!”
Thinking of this, Lu Li's expression became a little distorted, he roared, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The wind and snow are getting bigger and bigger, the sky is gradually getting dim, and the faint light from the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain road is looming, which is extremely charming and fascinating.
Chapter 001
“My brother is going to find a job. You can do your homework at home. Here is ten yuan. Don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon.”
In front of a low hut in the slum, Lu Li patted little Lolita on the head and rubbed and rubbed lovingly. It was nice to see her sister alive so healthy and lively!
“Brother, I know,” little Loli muttered and complained, “Don't rub my hair, it's all messed up by you."”
My younger sister Lu Xin was very considerate to help Lu Li organize her clothes, and told her like a little adult: "You must work hard. My brother can endure hardships so much. I believe I will be able to find a job this time.”
“Don't worry, my brother will definitely find a good job, make a lot of money, and let Xinxin live a good life,” Lu Li hugged his sister and added secretly in his heart. He won't watch you lose your life a little bit because he has no money.
“When Xinxin grows up, she will make a lot of money,” little Loli twisted in Lu Li's arms, swearing and waving her small fist.
No matter how reluctant, Lu Li still said goodbye to his sister.
When he got on the bus, he paused with his hand in his pocket and couldn't help but smile bitterly.
The money that I just gave my sister for lunch is back in her pocket. I should have expected this little girl to do this a long time ago. It's really well-behaved and sad.
It is now the 23rd century. Science and technology are infinitely developed, and various intelligent technologies are flooding every corner of the world. This development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but by the way, it has also reduced the demand for manpower to a minimum.
Unemployment is no longer an unusual thing, especially for people at the bottom of society like Lu Li, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there is no accident, he will remain unemployed.
It wasn't until he joined a game union's gold group by chance that he stabilized, but because he entered the game called "Dawn", the game had been open for nearly a year, and the level was too far behind, so he has never been among the super masters. Among the super masters.
Two years later, her younger sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a physical examination at school.
There is no money to pay for up to millions of treatment costs. During that period of time in the game, he has been hunted down by several trade unions, and he can only watch his only relative in pain as he weakens day by day.
That taste was more uncomfortable than cutting meat with a knife, and Lu Li hugged her sister more than once and cried bitterly.
However, fate has taken a turn. On the day he received the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and fell asleep in front of his sister's hospital bed. He woke up to find that he had been reborn, reborn three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew that he had to make money and make a lot of money.
With money, we can cure our sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money can our sister live the happy life that a really cute little girl should live like countless of her peers.
With money, you will raise your eyebrows and exhale, and you will not be inferior at any time!
After calculating it, Lu Li reluctantly discovered that even if he was reborn, it was not easy to become a rich man.
All he can do seems to be playing games-the "Dawn" that he has been playing for more than two years-and there are only a few days left before the game opens.
Lu Li has given up his plan to find a serious job. He came out today and went directly to the headquarters of the Xingyue Trade Union where he had served in his previous life.
The Xingyue Trade Union is not the top ten in games, nor the top four in China. It is just a game alliance composed of a group of college students. The leaders of the trade union are all very rich second-generation people. Because they are willing to spend money, their development is also similar.
The Qinghu Community, located next to the university city, can be regarded as the most scenic place of this generation. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with cherry blossoms everywhere. In front is an office building and behind is a villa area. Only people with very financial resources can set up a company here.
The beauty at the front desk glanced at Lu Li's dress in disgust, dialed a string of numbers, and then notified Lu Li that she could go in for an interview.
“We currently only recruit death squads, and we don't accept gold players anymore.” The one in charge of recruiting is a girl who is dressed very trendy and is in charge of the interview without raising her head while applying nail polish.
The so-called death squads are actually cannon fodder, and it is normal to die more than a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Li wanted to find a studio to join was to use the studio's game helmet for free. Although the gold player has no future, he can at least upgrade. The cannon fodder destined to be difficult to upgrade is not what he wants. , Death in the game will lose experience.
“What, 20 gold!"The nail polish was applied to her face all at once, and the girl screamed like a cat being stepped on.
Although "Dawn" represents today's most advanced virtual technology and has the world's most first-class design team, it is not confident enough to dare to go public without the inside, but the content of the test is relatively small, and it is a decentralized test, and it will not have an impact on normal games.
In just a few days of testing, the most impressive impression left by the players is that the gold coins are not easy to play, and there are too many places to spend money.
Players in normal games basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold players can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that if they want to save enough 20 gold to establish a trade union, it will take at least a week or more to get rid of the repair equipment and potion consumption for a 100-person gold group to brush the appropriate monsters. This is the case where the money explosion rate was high before the third system update of the game.
And this kid in front of him, he actually promised to take out 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
“Have you participated in the inside? Did you find any money-swiping bugs?"The recruitment beauty moved in her heart and asked suspiciously.
Lu Li smiled without saying a word, looking extremely inscrutable.
“Aojian, I have something to do here. Come here... Well, someone came to apply for a goldsmith and said that he could hand in 20 gold coins within a week. I SUSPECT HE has THE BUG of swiping MONEY. ” There is NO WAY to recruit beautiful women, so I can only call the senior management in a low voice.
It didn't take long to hear a rapid sound of footsteps, and when he turned his head to look, Lu Li was also a little surprised.
In addition to Xingyue's boss Ao Jian, the people who came here actually followed several people. Lu Li had been in the Xingyue Trade Union for two years in his previous life. Most of these people knew each other and were all high-level members of the trade union.
“Oh, don't tell me, this kid is the one who can get 20 gold a week,” the little man walking next to Ao Jian couldn't help but wail. This person's name is half a cigarette. He is the head of the Thieves Group of the Xingyue Trade Union. He is a very frizzy person.
“You have a way to get 20 gold coins within a week. Are you sure it's the game "Dawn"?"Ao Jian's face is not very good-looking either. He was originally holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope was gone.
Lu Li looked ordinary, his face was sallow and dark, his clothes were crumpled, and there were obvious traces of wear and tear at the corners. At first glance, he knew that he was the kind of person who was rolling and crawling at the bottom of society.
“It's useless to say it, even if you can't get it, you won't lose much, will you?"Facing the huge aura and the social elites who are surrounded by them, Lu Li doesn't have the cramped conditions of the little people at the bottom, but just smiles faintly, and his calm eyes seem to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter One
“Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay? Get up quickly. Class is about to start soon. This class is ruthless. Get up quickly.”A somewhat anxious voice sounded in Ye Mo's ears, and Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
“This idiot, I guess he has no face to see people, so he covers his face."Another voice sounded in his ear, but Ye Mo woke up now.
Ye Mo looked around blankly, no one knew him, all strange faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's dazed appearance, there was another burst of laughter. It was obvious that the laughter here was all directed at him. Seeing that the laughing people around him seemed to be laughing at him, he didn't dare to ask out loud for a while, so he could only secretly be on guard to prevent someone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who didn't laugh at himself. He kindly pushed himself to wake up just now.
“Why is it like a school?"Ye Mo asked subconsciously in surprise.
“Haha...” There was another burst of laughter.
“Ye Mo, I think you are confused. Can Yan Yan write love letters casually?" You are okay in the Ye family. Now you are no longer from the Ye family. Be careful in the future.”
The same table sighed, naturally, of course, he didn't believe that Ye Mo would not remember for such a while, he just loved his face. He hadn't recognized the reality yet, he was no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head ached for a while. He remembered that he and Master Luo Ying were refining back to Yuandan, and then the group of miscellaneous hairs from Xiliumen came over, and then there were explosions and various fighting sounds. He remembered that the master held him and used a escape talisman, but how could he appear here? Is this still Luoyue Continent?
By the way, I am sitting here now, where is Master? The master is only three years older than him. What's more, the reason why Xiliumen came to attack them suddenly was because the master was too beautiful. The young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful master, which happened after the master rejected it. .
In case the master fell into Xiliumen's hands, the consequences would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, Ye Mo couldn't help but panic in his heart and stood up suddenly.
“What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell rang?”A young woman with a cold face walked up to the podium with a few books in her hand, and glanced coldly at the laughing students below, her laughter suddenly subsided.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, a lecturer in English class. The most annoying thing is that the students heckle, and once she is targeted by her, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already felt that something was wrong. Although he could understand these words, the obvious language was not what he originally used. Isn't this Luoyue Continent anymore? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly. Bouts of headaches came, and a lot of messy information was remembered.
Ye Mo was completely expelled from the Ye family after his father's death, the specific reason was because Ye Mo was not Ye Wentian's seed. To be more precise, after the death of Ye Mo's father, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-identified again, and it was determined that he was not a member of the Ye family, so he was expelled from Yemen.
But he also has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Feng.It's just that neither he nor he are the same mother, but half-siblings. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Mo, and he deliberately proposed to the Ye family to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianwen probably knew that he was not well, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, so he found the Ning family in the capital.
The Ning family is of course extremely willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China. Ning Qingxue, the granddaughter of Old Man Ning, was promised to Ye Mo.
During a physical examination in the hospital, Ye Mo was checked out to be a genius. To put it bluntly, he just couldn't be humane. Although the Ye family wanted to try their best to hide the facts, it seemed that the entire capital knew overnight that the Ye family, one of the five major families in China, had a natural disaster, and the Ye family was considered to have lost a lot of face.
“Ah...” The memory was turned here, Ye Mo screamed, stood up, and almost immediately took off his pants to take a look.He already understood that he might be reborn to a person also named Ye Mo, but he couldn't be humane, so it was better to kill him.
“That classmate, what's your name and what are you yelling during class? Go to my office after class.”The beautiful teacher who was giving a lecture was interrupted by Ye Mo's scream, her face was very ugly.
The rest of the classmates in the class were secretly amused. They let a college student go to the office at every turn. It is estimated that only this English teacher can come out. It's not good if you don't go. The credits are in the hands of others.
Ye Mo sat down decadently. Although he didn't know much about the inside story of the family struggle, he also knew that he was probably driven out of the Ye family because of the weather, not necessarily because he was not from the Ye family. Besides, who knows what to do in the DNA test.
What Ye Mo was worried about was not that he was driven out of the Ye family. He would not care about this at all. What he cared about was his own destiny. Also, how is his master Luo Ying?
However, he also understood why the classmates in the class were laughing, because his predecessor had obviously been expelled from the Ye family, and he still persisted in pursuing Yanyan, the hottest girl in the class. As a result, he posted his confession love letter on the blackboard, and then stood on the podium and looked at himself contemptuously and said, "Master Ye, can you sleep with me?"”
Later, after the Tianyu incident was spread out, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to ask for a face, but what he didn't expect was that the girl who was originally very flattering to him actually treated him like this. In a hurry, he fainted and lost his life. Rebirth.
I was reborn to such a place. He didn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's class on the podium. Even if he understood it, Ye Mo wouldn't listen to it. He would definitely not accept what he was doing now. Instead of being reborn like this, it is better not to be reborn.
It doesn't matter whether you go to college or not, the most important thing is to figure out your current situation. His talent is related to the reputation of the Ye family. Although he was expelled from the Ye family, who knows if he will be killed suddenly? Maybe there were other insider information that caused him to be expelled from the Ye family. Is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the bell rang after class, of course, Ye Mo's first thing was not to go to the beautiful teacher, but to rush out of the school in a hurry. He wanted to find a place to see if his little** was really good.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are many small hutongs. Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a remote and uninhabited small hutong and quickly pulled down his pants.
Xiao** is really small, but Ye Mo was not so disappointed because of Xiao**, but really sighed. He is not a celestial god, but because he is too small and too big, he is blocked from developing by a meridian, causing this kind of false celestial God.
But that's it. With the current technology on the earth, it is undoubtedly a crazy dream to open up his blocked meridians, but this can't beat Ye Mo. Although he still doesn't have the ability to open the blocked meridians and make himself small. Majestic, but as long as he reaches the third level of qi practice, this meridian will automatically be flushed away.
It's just that Ye Mo immediately began to be a little disappointed again, because in the case of such a thin vitality of the earth, it is undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of qi cultivation. Maybe he will never be able to achieve it in his life. In that case, he is still equivalent to the heavens and the earth. With a sigh, Ye Mo was about to pull on his pants, when a sudden scream made him excited.
“Playing a hooligan..." An absolutely high-decibel soprano sounded in front of Ye Mo. Ye Mo just checked his little** and forgot to check the surrounding situation. Unexpectedly, this small alley is still connected, but it can't be seen here at the turn in front of it.
Ye Mo is not an expressionist, besides, he has no capital to expose now, so he quickly pulled up his pants and slipped away.
“Ye Mo, why are you?”After the woman screamed, she actually asked in a surprised tone. It was obvious that she knew Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the dead of night, Qingzhu Senior Community, Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents in his hand, looking at the swimming pool outside the landing window, full of loss and unwillingness.
As the leader of Youying, one of the four major game studios in Jinhai City, he leads a grand guild of tens of thousands of people, and is a well-known master sword magician in Jinhai City, but now he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
Ten years of gaming career.
Ten years of bloody fighting.
After countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild and established ten major city-states in "Asgard". When he could start to compete with the first-class guild and enjoy endless glory, a piece of paper became a cloud of smoke, and it was gone forever.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. For the sake of the game, he gave up so much, but in the end he became the wedding dress of others. It was all because he opposed the merger of Youying into the super Guild to dominate the world. Less than the next day, the Lanhua Consortium gave him a reply. Delete the 200-level sword king account he spent ten years of hard work to build, and go to the finance office to settle his salary.
All he can get is five million credit points and a mansion. Compared with the ten major city-states established, the virtual kingdom of Rijin Doujin is less than a dime.
Shi Feng thought that he had paid so much for Youying to turn Lanhua Group into a big consortium. A lot of the work was his, but the result was like throwing garbage. He lost him. For what the Lanhua Consortium did, he would definitely retaliate. .
“I will never just forget it, it's a big deal to start over.”
Shi Feng's eyes flashed with confidence and firmness, the termination document in his hand was torn to pieces, then he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and suddenly took a few sips.
Even without the Sword King account and the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, it can rise in the Asgard and establish a virtual kingdom of its own again.
In the early morning, the sun had just risen.
Didi Didi!
The phone's ringtone keeps ringing.
Shi Feng was woken up dissatisfied, and reluctantly got up and picked up the mobile phone by the bed. The hangover from last night is still fainting.
“Hey, what's the matter?”
“Brother Feng, I'm Heizi, what else are you asking? We agreed to become professional players. Today is the day when Youying Studio in the school recruits people. Don't you always want to be a core member of Youying?”
Shi Feng was a little confused.
Just after being fired by the Lanhua Consortium, how could he go to Youying for an assessment. “Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
Are you listening? They are going to test at ten o'clock. If you don't come over soon, it will be too late!”
“Heizi, don't be kidding, I just got fired by Youying.”
“Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? I haven't woken up yet, Youying hasn't hired anyone yet, how did you get fired? Okay, hurry up and come on.”
Before Shi Feng could react, Heizi hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, with a faint head, looked at his mobile phone and found that this dilapidated Ai Mad Six was not his mobile phone at all, but his mobile phone was the latest Ai Mad Twelve.
Then he looked around. The small bedroom of less than 15 square meters is in a mess. There are books about game strategies everywhere, as well as the laptop computer on the corner desk. It is also a very backward old model. In the large wardrobe by the wall, there are many clothes scattered, and a familiar face appeared in the fitting mirror of the large wardrobe.
Shi Feng was taken aback when he saw this familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the fitting mirror, and after taking pictures, he was sure that he was really young.
I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom yesterday, but now I get up and I'm in this broken place, and I'm getting younger.
Shi Feng still has some memories of this place. That was ten years ago, in order to fight for the small house that he rented when he was in his senior year in Asgard, he lived for more than half a year. Later, he made some money in Asgard, so he went to the city to rent a big apartment-style house.
I think it was extremely difficult back then, and the situation at home was not good. In order for him to go to college, he still owed a lot of foreign debts. In this way, his parents worked hard to make money every month and send enough living expenses to make themselves suffer.
Shi Feng wanted to make money and change his family situation, but college students are all over the street, and it is more difficult to find a job with a good income than to ascend to the sky, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game. In order to improve the game technology, he ruthlessly bought a virtual helmet. He has become a professional player. The goal is to practice hard in virtual games.
At that time, he ate white-faced buns and instant noodles every day. In order to save money, he had never participated in any reunion or networking in the class, so he became a little transparent in the class. The boys despised it, and the girls saw it far away. Every time he went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, he had less than ten credits in his wallet, and he didn't even dare to buy ham sausage with one credit. The female salesperson looked at Shi Feng pitifully and recommended a special ham. Shi Feng looked at the tempting ham and touched his wallet again, but gritted his teeth and refused.
“Is it who is joking with me?”
Shi Feng looked at the familiar scene and his young self in the mirror, and couldn't help shaking his head, denying this idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology. Who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on the phone again.
April 19, 2129.
“Could it be that I was reborn?"Shi Feng joked with a wry smile on his face.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, and it couldn't be April 2129, when he was still in his senior year.
Shi Feng shook his head, trying to wake up, but still holding a trace of expectation in his heart, expecting that he would be reborn and really go back to ten years ago, so he walked to the computer desk and turned on the laptop.
If the time of the mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the Internet can't be faked.
After a few minutes on the internet.
Shi Feng was completely shocked. The various information he queried on the Internet showed that today is indeed April 19, 2129. Even the official opening time of the world's hot Asgard is very clear on the official website. The countdown is six days later on April 25.
“Am I really back to ten years ago?"Shi Feng stared at the news report of Asgard, tears of excitement left in the corners of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood was indescribable, with regret, grief, and joy.
It seemed that everything in front of him was a dream.
However, the sound of cicadas outside the window, as well as the air conditioning blowing out of the air conditioner, reminded Shi Feng that all this was true.
Looking at the family photos taken when he was in college on his mobile phone, Shi Feng never noticed that his father had white hair and the corners of his mother's eyes were wrinkled. They were really old and not as energetic as before.
When he noticed that his parents were getting old, it was a year and a half after the opening of Asgard. High debts, excessive labor and pressure caused both parents to get seriously ill. They couldn't afford to get sick. If they wanted to be cured and recovered, they would need millions of credit points, but at that time, Shi Feng was just a small captain of Youying, and the money he earned couldn't pay for such expensive expenses.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried his best, but unfortunately it was not enough. Even if Shi Feng tried his best to maintain it, his parents still left a few months later.
He didn't take good care of his parents in his last life. Who knows the pain and regret?
Even if Shi Feng earned millions of credit points later, this became an eternal pain in Shi Feng's heart.
Unexpectedly, fate made such a joke for him, and he really started from scratch, and everything returned to the original point.
“Okay, great, hahaha. Now that I am reborn, I must change all this, earn enough money, cure my parents' diseases, and prevent them from working for life. Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and swore secretly.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Heizi's phone call came again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for an assessment.
However, Shi Feng was not slow. He got dressed and packed himself before heading to Jinhai University.
He couldn't be more familiar with Youying.
I remember that when I was in college, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of Lanhua Group, opened Youying Studio and provided a lot of funds to organize master students from Jinhai University to fight in Asgard. At that time, he also went to the assessment and became a core member, and Heizi became a peripheral member. At that time, he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, Youying Studio had his leadership, which allowed Lanhua Group to make a lot of money in Asgard and became a big consortium. Unexpectedly, Lan Hailong was personally expelled in the end.
Now that he has been reborn, he still has an advantage that others cannot match in Asgard. Naturally, he is not ready to join Youying again, become a tool for others, and make money for others. He has to go a different way and fight for his own life. No need to let his parents parasitize living expenses and pay off all debts, so he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng came to the No. 1 teaching Building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking around at the gate, very anxious. This person was Heizi.
“Brother Feng, you are finally here. Fortunately, the registration is not closed. Let's go in and register as soon as possible."Heizi said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously: "Heizi, I'm not going to Youying anymore. I want to start the studio by myself. Are you coming?"”
Kuroko met in a virtual game, his skills are very good, and then they broke into the world together. It can be said that they are brothers. In the days when Youying worked together, although Heizi had no gaming talent, his management was very strong. He managed hundreds of thousands of people in the guild in an orderly manner. With Heizi's help, achieving the goal will go further, but he will follow Heizi's choice. After all, he now has nothing, and Heizi's family is not good. For life, he decided to be a professional player and join Youying to earn living expenses.
It took a full minute before Heizi looked up at Shi Feng.
“Brother Feng, don't be silly, do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's 8,000 credit points. To open a studio, you need at least six people, a workplace, wages, etc., the start-up capital alone requires 70,000 to 80,000, and follow-up investment. That's a lot of money, but do you have that much money now?"Heizi knows Shi Feng's situation very well. Knowing that Shi Feng's family is in a bad situation, he wants to persuade Shi Feng to give up this crazy idea.
“You're right, I don't even have the money to buy Asgard's virtual helmet now."Shi Feng nodded silently and admitted. As Heizi said, even 70,000 or 80,000 is less. I remember that the 100-person studio recruited by Lan Feilong spent more than 5 million. In the later stage, in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio, it spent a lot. .
“In that case, why should we take risks? It's not more stable to go to Youying. At least Youying can provide virtual helmets. Otherwise, we can't even play, let alone become professional players."Heizi saw that Shi Feng understood the key to the problem, and he breathed a sigh of relief, so he pulled Shi Feng into the teaching building.
Shi Feng shook Heizi's hand away, looked at Heizi seriously, and said with a serious expression: "But I still plan to open my own studio. I don't want to be restrained. Heizi, are you coming?”
Shi Feng would not force Heizi, after all, he had no guarantee, and it was impossible to tell the secret that he was a reborn person. He only hoped that Heizi could believe him.
Seeing Shi Feng's serious expression, Heizi always feels that Shi Feng today is very strange and crazy. It is impossible to make money in the early stage of virtual games. Everyone knows this. Is there any way for Shi Feng to make money in Asgard? Even if they make money, it will be a few months later, and they don't have that much time to waste.
Heizi hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed: “I see, who made you the eldest brother, I will start the studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, we can't play games without a helmet?”
Shi Feng's tight brows suddenly loosened, he patted Heizi on the shoulder happily, and smiled: “This is my good brother. Don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that there is a trial discount for college students in Asgard. There are places in every university. As long as you rely on your student ID card, you can get a virtual helmet for free for ten days. Let's take a look.”
Heizi's dark face turned livid at this time, and he felt that the future was dark. Why would he believe Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng's self-confidence and stability? Is it really okay to start a business with Shi Feng?
What can you do in Asgard in ten days?
Ten days later, I will definitely miss a good time for major studios to recruit people. In the end, I don't want to buy a virtual helmet, but how does the money come from?
If you want to earn 16,000 credits in the ten days when Asgard opens, even a group of professional players can't do it!
“Leave it to me about the money.”
Shi Feng patted Heizi on the shoulder, showing a confident smile.
Earning 16,000 credit points in ten days is whimsical, but he has the courage to be a reborn person, no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break them one by one. And the opening of Asgard was the beginning of his rise.
Then Shi Feng took Heizi to collect the trial helmet, and bought all the money for instant noodles, and put them next to the computer desk in the rental room. There were two large boxes, enough for more than ten days of food. After that, he explained some things about Asgard, and quietly waited for the opening of Asgard.
At nine o'clock in the evening on April 25th, a few glimmers of light flickered in the dark and silent hut.
Shi Feng lay quietly on the bed, his eyes closed, and he gently clicked the start button of the helmet.
“Asgard, I'm here.”
I can't tell what the sound is. Hearing it in my ears seems to penetrate the body and rush into the soul, making people shiver a few times in this cold and snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpered through the sky and the earth, and bursts of white snow fluttered in the wind, dividing the sky into pieces, and sprinkling the earth layer by layer. Looking from a distance, it was as if it was wrapped in silver, and the place was desolate.
This is not late at night, it's just dusk, but the dimness of the sky is the same as the dark night, giving people a heavy feeling, as if pressed against the heart, out of breath. On the silver earth, you can see a huge outline, it is a majestic city, as if a giant beast is approaching.
In the center of the city, there is a towering tower-shaped altar, in the shape of seven horns, the whole body is dark, straight into the cloud peak, standing towering and immovable in the storm and snow, the whimpering wind blowing on the altar is mixed with such a kalakkala sound, scattered into the distance, with primitive roughness, don't have a rhyme.
The hoarse murmur floated out of the altar in the wind and snow, as if fused with the wind, faintly indistinguishable.
“If there is hope, where is the hope? If there is no hope, why let me see it! ！”The voice seemed crazy, almost hysterical, roaring and swirling for nine days.
Below the altar, there are countless figures in demoiselle clothes standing there silently at this moment. When you look at it from a distance, there are hundreds of thousands of them, both men and women, surrounding the altar, densely packed, motionless, but fanaticism emerges, like the people on the altar. With a word, they can give everything for it.
Snow, it's bigger.
“Since you let me see it, there will be hope, but where is the hope...!”The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter and sad, and it lasted for a long time.
“Today, Minghuang returned by mistake, Santai opened up the wasteland, and the snow and wind came to Xixi. It will last forever. The old man will be considered quite heavenly again!”The voice suddenly became louder, and I didn't know what means I used, but I saw the clouds in the sky change in color, and all the countless falling snowflakes suddenly stopped, and then all rolled upside down, whistling from all sides and condensed together, making the world tremble!
When there was no more snow falling in the sky, all the snowflakes condensed to form a huge snow-colored mysterious dragon. As soon as this dragon was formed, it immediately raised its head to the sky and screamed, and its voice was so stern that all those who heard it were immediately shocked, as if they were about to be torn apart by the sound.
Bursts of shocking blood, secreted from the snow dragon, soon filled his whole body, making the snow dragon like a blood dragon, it roared mournfully, struggling and rushing towards the sky, like a meteor straight into the sky, as if to blast a hole in the sky and open a hope.
Its speed is so fast that it is endless in a blink of an eye. Between the roars and swirls, it seems that this dragon has hit an invisible diaphragm somewhere. The world vibrates, and the sound of buzzing spreads in all directions. The blood dragon screamed again, and its body collapsed layer by layer at a speed visible to the naked eye.
At the moment when it was about to completely shatter, the hundreds of thousands of silent people below the altar all pinched their hands, bit the tip of their tongues, and spurted out a mouthful of blood. Those blood seemed to be drawn by some kind of force and galloped up, like a sea of blood rising into the air, heading straight for the collapsed blood dragon. After merging with it, the dragon's collapse eased and rushed to a higher sky.
Seeing the blood dragon flying higher and higher, it condensed everyone's gaze, but at this moment, the blood dragon shook his whole body violently, and after uttering a sharp hiss that spread for tens of thousands of miles, he couldn't stop the collapse of his body. It turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes and fell down. From a distance, the sky and the earth were already dyed red. Yellow spring.
Even more at this moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, a voice completely different from the roar came from its mouth!"Shame......”
At the top of the altar, in the center, sat cross-legged an old man in a purple robe. The old man's face was wrinkled and covered with brown spots. He murmured and opened his eyes, but his eyes were dim. , Obviously a blind man.
There was a complete spine in front of him, exuding the light of Senbai, and he was holding a stone in his right hand, resting on the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes looked at the sky silently, for a long time, for a long time, with a long sigh.
During his words, the right hand holding the stone piece moved again on the weird spine, rubbing against the animal bones, making a clicking sound, and dissipating into the distance. His figure was significantly bleak, fused with this voice, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
In the middle of the night, it was pitch black, but the reckless mountains were not calm, fierce beasts were infested, roaring shook the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, and the leaves rustled down.
With another beast roar, Lin Feng shrank his neck, dusted off the leaves that fell on his body, looked at the mountains in the dark, and sighed in his heart, this place is really completely different from the earth.
Lin Feng sat under the tree in a daze, and several sturdy teenagers on the opposite side looked at him with contempt, and a little fat man shouted at Lin Feng: “Leaving you a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat dry food, hurry up and go to work!”
Lin Feng recovered, did not speak, patted his ass and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted: “Useless waste, his physical strength is not as good as a child, so he should be thrown into the mountains and eaten by the beasts!"”
Lin Feng curled his lips, brother, an earthman who has traveled through, how can he compare his strength with your group of animals?
This Tianyuan Great World is a world dominated by cultivators.
The wolf village in front of me is just a small village in the reckless mountains. Naturally, there are no cultivators, but every villager has practiced martial arts hard and worked hard, even women and children.
Only in this way can we survive in a world where fierce beasts are rampant and even Taikoo relics are infested.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village also have to go into the mountains to hunt. Many prey are used to coming out at night. Although entering the mountains at night is dangerous, the harvest will be greater.
The people in the village are used to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village don't sleep, so they get together to play and wait for their adults to return from hunting.
The children who were still dragging their snot-clearing noses were playing with dozens or hundreds of catties of stone locks as toys, and a group of teenagers were competing for who could lift the giant tripod weighing a thousand catties at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at this group of small animals and sighed secretly. Comparing his strength with them, he really looked very wasteful.
But this will not make Lin Feng feel frustrated. Although he is talked about behind him from time to time, he still relies on his fooling ability to temporarily live in this small mountain village called Wolf Village. What really made him miserable was that there was one more thing in his mind.
Super Ancestor system.
At first, Lin Feng was still happy in his heart, thinking that there are benefits to crossing, but the system explained that the first one made him feel cold.
“The main task of the system: The host opens a mountain and establishes a sect, establishes the world's largest sect in this party, and becomes the first ancestor.”
“The main task is divided into different stages. Each stage needs to be completed within a limited time. If it is not completed after the timeout, the host will be directly obliterated!”
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence “obliterate the host”, speechless for a long time, and finally squeezed out a few words from between his teeth: “I bought a watch last year!”
After his anger, Lin Feng read the contents of the task helplessly. He was not ready to risk challenging the system to see if the other party could obliterate him. He hadn't sat up hot when he first came to this world, and he didn't want to die again.
The main task 1.0-To store four disciples of the mantle.
Task description: Even if it is a casual cultivation, if you want to inherit your own mantle, you must accept apprentices. The most important resource of a sect is always people. They are the descendants of disciples with outstanding talents. Famous teachers are difficult to find, and high-level disciples are even more difficult to find.
Task time limit: One year, if the timeout is not completed, the host will be directly obliterated.
“Cheating!"Lin Feng sighed, as far as we are a newcomer who has just crossed over, the tender one is like a refreshing cabbage. I should quickly find a big cow as a master and give it a good hug, right?"
Brother System, at least you can give me this cheats before you can accept apprentices. What do you want me to teach people about this poor and white one? Are you fooling and blowing?
What's more, the system stated that there was a novice gift package, but told him that the gift package system had failed, and the novice gift package was delayed, making Lin Feng sigh that it was not the most cheating, but more cheating.
The exchange system that was opened was full of all kinds of good things, Linglang, Lingdan magic weapons, and magical powers. Only you can't think of it. There is no stock without him.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng doesn't have even one exchange point right now, so he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding his mother in his heart, and there was a sudden commotion at the entrance of the village. It seemed that the hunting team had returned.
The young people waiting in the village cheered and greeted them at the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced indifferently, but was shocked to find that all the young and strong people who had returned from hunting had returned empty-handed. There was no prey, not to mention, even the weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are the second life. Living in this big mountain, they can't live without weapons.
An imperceptible smile appeared at the corner of Lin Feng's mouth: “There seems to be a story."Thinking of this, he also walked to the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before he got close, he heard someone roar: “Wolf wind is the hope of our wolf village. Now that he has been seriously injured by the people of Stone Village, he must not give up!”
Lin Feng raised his eyes and saw a young man in the middle of the crowd sitting on the ground with a wilted expression, covered in scars, and a cold light of hatred appeared in his eyes.
“This is the genius who was talked about by the people of Wolf Village?"Lin Feng peeked and observed that he has been famous for this wolf wind for a long time. The idol of the entire wolf village teenagers is regarded as the hope of the village. Today is the first time Lin Feng has seen a real person.
Although Wolf Wind was injured at this time and his expression was sluggish, he was full of energy and blood. Although his physical strength could not be compared with that of a cultivator, he was definitely the top among secular warriors.
According to the public theory of Tianyuan Great World, you have this level at a young age. If you practice qi, you will also have a future for development. After all, the cultivator is to guide the aura of heaven and earth into the body, condense mana, and strengthen your own foundation.
Lin Feng quietly adjusted his super ancestor system, which had a disciple talent detector, and he pressed OK on Wolf Wind.
“The subject's qualifications are too low to become a disciple of the host.”
Lin Feng frowned. This system was too picky. He originally thought about accepting four disciples casually first, fooling the one-year deadline of the system, and finally expelling these few disciples from the door wall. On the line.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to drill into the loopholes in the system. Even a talented teenager like Wolf Wind, who is famous for ten miles and eight townships, is not qualified. Lin Feng wants to collect four disciples to complete the system task, it is too difficult. .
“One year, one year..." Lin Feng sighed depressed.
In the crowd, an old man beside Wolf Feng's face was livid, and he snorted: “Wolf Feng is my grandson. Of course, this matter can't just be forgotten, but not now. There has been a lot of movement in the mountains in recent days. It seems that a mountain treasure is about to be born. Get the mountain treasure first, and then settle the account with Shicun!”
There are often fights between rural clans, and Lin Feng is not interested in this, but the word ”Shanbao" comes to his ears, which makes his heart move slightly.
Lin Feng was thinking about Shanbao, and suddenly heard someone in the crowd cursing in a low voice: “I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster. He is less than four years old. A little doll can defeat the genius wolf wind in our village. Damn it!”
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
The little doll less than four years old defeated the wolf wind in front of him?
Wolf Wind is already a bit talented, and the person who injured him is not even four years old. What kind of talent should it be?
The little fat man next to Lin Feng cursed in a low voice: "Damn kid, you must kill him!”
After glancing at him, Lin Feng agreed: "Yes, yes.”
But in my heart, I was thinking that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd. He now wanted to grow his wings and fly to Shicun immediately, but he didn't dare to go out of the village alone, otherwise he would just add food to the beasts in the mountains.
At this moment, a mechanical and rigid tone suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
“The novice gift package is released, do you check it immediately?”
After Lin Feng was taken aback for a moment, he was overjoyed. He had never felt that the boring and rigid system tone was so pleasant.
Looking for a place where there is no one, Lin Feng clicked on the gift package.
Novice gift package: The host gets the four-level realm of basic cultivation and qi training period, gets a lucky draw opportunity, gets 300 redemption points, gets the secret secret of Taoism "Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa", and gets the magical power of Nine Heavens and Thunder.
Lin Feng was dumbfounded, a warm current fell from the top of his head, running straight between his chest and abdomen, and quickly rushed through a hidden hole in his body.
There are twelve important acupuncture points hidden in the human body, which cultivators call the twelve-storied tower.
The cultivation during the Qi training period is divided into twelve floors, which is to open the twelve-story building. Every hole orifice is opened, the aura will be transformed into mana, and the cultivator's mana will go to a higher level.
Lin Feng now felt a warm current Lian Zhan Lian Jie, walking all the way, until he opened up the four orifices in his body before disappearing. With Lin Feng's breathing, the vitality of heaven and earth from the outside world was quickly inhaled into his body, spinning in the four orifices that were opened up.
Each hole orifice is like a non-stop star cluster universe, and the aura is constantly transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just as the universe is beginning to open and all creatures are evolving.
Lin Feng felt that his whole body had become lighter, and as soon as his mind moved, the magic power in the orifice was like a spring, and the explosive power was about to move.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, feeling relieved: "I finally have some self-protection.”But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system is to establish the first sect in history and to become the first ancestor in history, Lin Feng was suddenly under a lot of pressure and hurriedly checked the other things in the novice's gift package.
“Lucky draw opportunity?"Lin Feng took a look. In addition to the redemption system, there is also a lottery system in the auxiliary training system, but it is gray and is still in an inactive state. For the time being, there is no need to think about it.
At present, I can only hope that the purchasing power of the 300 redemption points is higher.
While thinking about it, Lin Feng entered the exchange system. Before he was poor and white, he didn't have the heart to look at the price.
After taking a closer look at the price, Lin Feng secretly scolded the system for its black heart. The lowest-level bottle of Qi nourishing pill requires ten redemption points, and a slightly spiritual iron-making sword requires thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic outfit, a set of feather star crowns, it takes fifty points.
The most basic magical powers, such as “Fireball Technique” and “Palm Thunder”, cost one hundred points.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros hanging behind their asses, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them at all, for fear of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his “Existing redemption points” column and shook his head: “There are too few start-up funds.”
Fortunately, the novice gift pack issued a secret book of Taoism and a supernatural power, otherwise Lin Feng would really be confused.
Taoism is the foundation of cultivation, mainly to improve the realm, while supernatural powers are practical martial arts or spells with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the grade of Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa in the gift package is very high, and the existing exchange system cannot even be exchanged. It must be upgraded before it can be exchanged.
As for the system upgrade, it takes Lin Feng to complete a certain number of system tasks before it can be turned on. It is still very early to say.
Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa is one of the top thunder Taoism in the Tianyuan Great World, but it has been lost for many years. The predecessors who have been highly cultivated in the past are all walking sideways with this Taoism. Big bull.
According to the instructions, the novice gift package is a kind of Taoism randomly issued, and it can be used to prescribe the Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa. Lin Feng can be regarded as the green smoke from the ancestral grave. Although the purchasing power of 300 redemption points is limited, Lin Feng's depression at this time was swept away. .
With such a top-level Taoism, if there is no such damn main mission, Lin Feng must first find a place where no one can practice a magical skill before coming out to kill the quartet.
But now that he is going to accept apprentices, that is another way of saying it.
Dissatisfied and dissatisfied, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and acted quickly.
He remained silent, and after asking for the path to Stone Village, he quietly left Wolf Village without alerting others.
There is now a state of hostility between the two villages. Lin Feng, who has become a cultivator, is not afraid of trouble from the people of Wolf Village, but he is afraid that they will reveal their identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, the people of Wolf Village are now gathered at the entrance of the village. Because of the discussion about Wolf Feng's injury, Lin Feng went around from behind the village, and no one noticed his movements.
Walking on the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate to directly invest in fifty exchange points to buy himself an outfit.
How could Lin Feng, who is from the earth, not know the truth of “Buddhas want gold, and people want clothes”? If you want to sell things, you must first do a good job of publicity and packaging.
Looking down at his feather-clothed star crown, white robe with wide sleeves, and the image of a fairy-style Taoist master, Lin Feng nodded in satisfaction. The system is expensive or expensive, but the quality and appearance are really not said.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing that caught his eye was half of a huge dead wood, the trunk of which was more than ten meters in diameter, and the whole body was scorched black.
Lin Feng glanced at it and speculated that it was a lightning strike wood. It had been struck by lightning many years ago. The huge canopy and vigorous vitality of the old tree were destroyed. Now there is only an 89-meter-high stump left on the surface. .
But just looking at the size of the existing trunk, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The whole body of the dead tree was scorched black, and there was no sign of life.
At this moment, an old man came over and said while coughing: “This tree has been withered for ten years."He walked up to Lin Feng and looked at Lin Feng up and down with a pair of eyes: “The little old man is the village chief of this stone village. I wonder if there is anything I can do to help this Taoist master?"”
Lin Feng smiled slightly, and his body naturally exuded an aura of dust and arrogance. Coupled with a suit, a white robe with wide sleeves, and a feather star crown, his appearance was completely impeccable, and he was definitely an expert in the world.
“Discovering the goal is suitable for becoming a disciple of the host.”
Lin Feng was just about to speak, when he heard the system tone that suddenly sounded, he almost choked on his saliva.
The old village chief of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but shivered in fright.
I saw Lin Feng's two eyes shining green, staring at the entrance of the village like a hungry wolf.
At the entrance of the village, a pink-carved jade-pecked, snow-white and cute child was pulling the tail of a big yellow dog hard. The child's voice was crisp and loud: "Babble, don't run!"”
The system in Lin Feng's mind kept ringing: “The talent system has been sorted out, and the No. 1 target information is as follows.”
"Root bone—>10; Perception—>8; Will—>8; blessing->8.”
"Summary: The goal is extremely talented. It is recommended to enter the sect and teach carefully. You must be the pillar of the sect.”
Lin Feng didn't see anything else, his eyes stared straight at the blood-red number “10” behind the root bone.
What does the root bone of 10 mean?
For example, for others to run, it takes 100 meters from the starting point to the end point. When the end point is the same, this little one starts from a distance of 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder the wolf wind he could beat when he was less than four years old was full of peach blossoms.
The little one also found Lin Feng at this time, and looked at him blankly, blinking his eyes wide, full of cute Zhengtai.
Lin Feng smacked his mouth. Not only is this product so strong that it defies the sky, but his understanding, will, and blessing are also super genius-level.
Is it a bit stressful to accept such a product as an apprentice?
Lin Feng pondered, a warm and sunny smile gradually appeared on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in his previous life saw him showing such a smile, he would definitely hide as far as he could.
Chapter 1
The morning sun, shining in through the light silver gauze curtain, just fell on the bed, and her piercing eyes were almost unable to open.
At the party last night, she drank too much for a while, and Lu Yanchen picked her up later.
Time sat up, the thin silk was slipped off, a touch of red on the white sheets was revealed, and his greasy skin was covered with hickey marks.
At this glance, you can know that it is the result of a night of indulgence.
“I love you.”
When the love was strong, his moving love words seemed to be still in his ears. Time's face was peach blossom, his eyes were shy, and he turned his head to look around.
Where is Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt and got out of bed. When his legs touched the ground, he was weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the light came out again, Lu Yanchen also came back, and slowly walked into the living room leisurely, his slender and upright figure with a powerful and oppressive aura.
Time raised his eyes and fell into a pair of deep eyes, his eyes were as quiet as an unfathomable clear pool.
In the end, it was the first time that such an intimate relationship had occurred. Time was inexplicably shy, and he lowered his eyes and dared not look at him.
When she was confused, she vaguely heard him say that he wanted to surprise her.
Are you going to propose to her?
Time was a little at a loss, and his heart was beating wildly.
As soon as she made a sound, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen in a deep voice: "Let's break up!”
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he wants to give her is to break up?
Is he teasing her, joking, or really, breaking up?
There was a scream of extreme pain, hidden in his throat and unable to make it out, it took a long time before he found his voice.，
Very light, very light, as if as low as the dust.“Breaking up, after we had a relationship..., Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?”
Lu Yanchen's indifferent expression did not change at all, “Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who hugged me and told me not to stop, you also enjoyed it last night.”
Time was stunned like being struck by lightning!
She was speechless, looking at this man who was completely different from what she remembered, she couldn't control her trembling, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why?"”
After speaking, he turned and looked out the window, with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth.
That smile seemed to time like a mockery.
Time's face was pale as snow, the pain started from the heart, pressing the nerve endings to the limbs, and the dizzying darkness hit. She pinched her palms tightly with her fingertips before she fainted.
The air suddenly became cold and biting damp, so cold that people trembled and suffocated, making them unable to stay for a minute.
Time is gone.
Chapter 1
Yuguo, Lingjia, Cangyun Town, the moon crosses the sky.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally be sure that he was indeed reincarnated and reborn.
For a strong man in the realm of heaven and man, it takes ten seconds to be sure of one thing, which is absolutely incredible, but it also proves how incredible what happened to him is.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and he had unprecedented achievements in Dandao. The technique of “three fire priming” he created triggered a revolution in the alchemy world, and he was revered as the “Dandi”.
But he was not satisfied, and he wanted to go one step further to reach the legendary realm of breaking the void, breaking the void, and turning everything into a god. To this end, he visited countless monuments, and finally entered the Valley of Black Blood. After many dangers, he found a mysterious ancient tower.
He did not disappoint him. The golden text appeared on the ancient pagoda. It was a supreme exercise called the "Immortal Book of Heaven". After practicing to the highest level, the body will not be broken and immortal, coexist with the heavens and the earth, and live with the sun and the moon!
But even with Ling Han's martial arts cultivation base in the human realm, he still felt that the "Immortal Book of Heaven" was obscure and difficult to understand, as if he was reading a Book of Heaven, and he had no clue at all.
He forcibly wrote down this exercise, and when he was about to study the ancient pagoda, the ancient pagoda vibrated lightly, releasing an immeasurable divine light, which instantly shattered his body. But the weird thing is that his soul has not dissipated, and he has fallen into a state of waking up and dreaming, which has lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul has been trying to figure out the Immortal Scripture-he can't do anything else except this. After ten thousand years, he finally understood the first layer of this exercise.
A strong man in the realm of heaven and man, it took 10,000 years to comprehend the first realm of a technique. What is this concept?
You must know that the strong in the realm of heaven and man generally have a longevity of less than a thousand years. Normally, no one in the world can cultivate the Immortal Book of Heaven, because they have died of old age before they even started.
But Ling Han mastered the first level of the "Immortal Book of Heaven" in this weird way, and then he suddenly came to life, reincarnated and reborn in a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
“No matter what's going on, anyway, I'm alive again!”
“Although this body is only the second-level cultivation base of body refining, and the waste materials can no longer be used, but I used to be a strong man in the realm of heaven and man, standing on the top of martial arts, and a master of Dandao. If you have poor qualifications, you can use pill to make up for it. I don't believe I can't return to the top.”
“Moreover, I can finally practice the Immortal Book of Heaven. This is a supreme exercise, and even...it may not be owned by the mortal world, but from the legendary god world. Otherwise, how could it take 10,000 years to understand the first exercise?”
“In this life, I will be able to surpass my predecessors and achieve the throne of God!”
“Also, what the hell is going on with this body? I only cultivated to the second level of body refining at the age of sixteen. Is it because today's martial arts are too withered?”
Boom, countless memories poured into my mind. This is the memory of another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people also merged together, regardless of the same.
“I understand.”
Ling Han nodded in his heart. The reason why he is now in the second level of refining is that his spiritual roots are too poor.
If you want to cultivate to become a martial artist, there is a prerequisite, that is, you must have spiritual roots. With spiritual roots, we can absorb the aura between heaven and earth, refine ourselves, and turn into our own primordial power.
Some spiritual roots absorb aura quickly, while others are slow. Therefore, the spiritual roots are divided into four major levels of heaven and Earth Xuanhuang, and each major level is divided into three small levels, upper, middle and lower. The top grade of the heaven level is the best, and the lower grade of the yellow level is the worst.
The key to judging the merits of spiritual roots lies in purity. The purer the better, but Ling Han's spiritual roots are both five elements and the most messy. In the martial arts world, this is the most inferior spiritual root, and it can only be said to be reluctant to be counted as a yellow-level inferior product. Therefore, he is now sixteen years old, but he has only cultivated to the second level of body refining, and his peers have also reached the fourth and fifth levels of body refining.
Ling Han in his previous life was the root of the heavenly spirit, and he was also the root of the heavenly Nine Suns Fire spirit, coupled with the unmatched talent of Dandao, supplemented by Dan Wu, it only took two hundred years to reach the realm of heaven and man. This is an unprecedented record.
“The five elements miscellaneous spiritual root, this is the lowest spiritual root, it is no wonder that although the predecessor worked extremely hard, he only had the second-level cultivation base of refining the body.”As far as I am concerned, although the five elements miscellaneous spiritual roots are a bit tricky, with the addition of pills, I will definitely be able to reach my peak again in at most four hundred years!"”
“Huh!”
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, with an unbelievable expression of shock on his face. He was stunned for a while, and with his powerful soul power, he re-looked at his spiritual roots in Dantian, and his shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
“This is not the root of the five elements of miscellaneous spirits, the five elements are completely balanced, forming a Dao Lotus! This is the five elements Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, rarer than the Nine Suns Fire spirit root, it can be called the god-level spirit root!”The predecessor's slow cultivation is because the god-level spiritual roots require special exercises to exert true power.”
“And I... just mastered a five-element heavenly power that matches the five-element Chaos Lotus!”
“One hundred years! No, it only takes fifty years for me to reach the realm of heaven and man again!”
Rao Yi Ling Han's cultivation base in the heavenly and human realm in his previous life couldn't help showing joy. The spiritual roots were destined to be born and could not be changed the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, in order to break the void and become a god, he visited countless ancient monuments and obtained a large number of exercises and secret techniques. The Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Exercises are one of them.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and in this life, he will create another glory and create an immortal myth.
“How did the predecessor die?”
Ling Han turned over and picked up the memory, but soon he showed an angry expression.
The predecessor was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the patriarch of the Ling family. His mother and grandparents passed away very early. And the Ling family is a martial arts family. Every member of the clan practices martial arts and respects martial arts. How can someone like Ling Dong sit on the position of the patriarch?It was his strongest strength that came out.
But Ling Han was regarded as a waste material since he was a child because of Linggen's problems, and he ate up his eyes.
In order to give his son a bright future, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang College-Huyang College will recruit Ling Han as a disciple and train him with all his strength, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing will enter the Valley of Ziguang to find something for Huyang College that was lost a long time ago. Something lost a long time ago.
Huyang Academy was established by the Yuguo Dynasty and has countless resources. If it is fully cultivated, even people who waste materials can be promoted to the Juyuan Realm.
But it's impossible for the people in Huyang Academy to be idiots. If that thing is easy to get, how can they be willing to offer such excellent conditions?
Ziguang Valley is full of dangers, and you may die if you take a wrong step, but for the sake of your son, Ling Dongxing set off without hesitation seven days ago.
Yesterday, people from Huyang College came and notified the Ling family that they would pick up people today as agreed. But at this time, Ling Zhongkuan, the archdeacon of the Ling family, ran over to discuss with his predecessor and asked him to give up this precious place to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with unlimited prospects, and such an opportunity cannot be wasted on a waste material.
Naturally, the predecessor would not agree, this is an opportunity for his father to exchange his life! But Ling Zhongkuan said it was a discussion, but in fact he was just notifying his predecessor, and he didn't take his opinions to heart at all.
The predecessor couldn't bear to take action, but Ling Zhongkuan was a strong man in the Juyuan Realm, and he could suppress him with one finger. Is he an opponent?
With just one punch, he was seriously injured, and then locked up in his room, obviously not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people of Huyang Academy. And by the time Ling Dongxing came back, it was done.
And his predecessor was so angry that he died.
Ling Han snorted, it was really too deceiving. The quota that his father gave up his life in exchange for was actually taken away by Ling Zhongkuan's grandson?
This pair of shameless dogs!
Can't bear it!
He got up from the bed and suddenly felt soreness all over his body-he was alive, but his injuries would not improve inexplicably.
“Linggen is still traumatized!"Ling Han frowned. Ling Zhongkuan's blow caused damage to his spiritual roots, and the spiritual roots were injured. This is a very troublesome thing. Ordinary medical stones are invalid.
“As far as I know, there are seven kinds of pills that can repair the spiritual roots, but the materials needed for the four kinds are too expensive, even if the entire Ling family is sold, it can't be exchanged-moreover, my spiritual roots are only lightly injured, and there is no need for such advanced pills.”
“Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into Dan. My current cultivation base on the second floor of the refining body is too reluctant. Then there is only one choice-Yuanxin Fu Ling San, you only need to mix the medicinal materials proportionally and cook them into a medicinal juice.”
“Heal the injury first, and then stop Ling Zhongkuan's grandson. Although I don't care about this place, I must not let my father's life-changing opportunity take advantage of these shameless grandsons!”
He sat down cross-legged and began to run the ”Immortal Book of Heaven."
This is the first time he has run this potentially god-level technique, but because he has been figuring it out for tens of thousands of years, he is now extremely calm in control.
Buzzing, a powerful vitality suddenly appeared in his body, and a lot of energy was consumed, but his injuries recovered quickly.
In just a few minutes, his injuries were gone.
“It deserves to be the Immortal Book of Heaven. I have just started practicing and I have such a miraculous effect. It's just that this is completely different from other exercises. The normal exercise method is to use the spiritual roots to transform the aura of heaven and earth into Yuanli, but the Immortal Heavenly Scripture is the opposite, refining the Yuanli to the body and healing injuries.”
“After practicing to the highest level, it is not impossible to be immortal.”That's why it can be called the Book of Heaven!"”It's a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I can repair all the spiritual roots with the Immortal Scripture."”
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the whitening sky outside the window, and murmured: “Now, it's time to meet Ling Zhongkuan's shameless old man for a while, and give him a surprise.”
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the door to block his way. This person was named Zhang Yuan and was one of Ling Zhongkuan's lackeys.
“Master Han, the archdeacon has ordered you, you have to stay in the room today!""Zhang Yuan said with a smile. Although the person on the opposite side is the son of the patriarch, he is a famous waste material, which is a joke in his eyes.
Ling Han's eyes shuddered, and he said, "Do you dare to stop me?”
It's you who stopped it. The archdeacon said, you must not let Ling Han make trouble today. If necessary, you can just beat it up! Zhang Yuanpi smiled and said without a smile: “This is the order of the archdeacon, and please don't embarrass me, Master Han.”
Ling Zhongkuan, an old dog, was really cautious. He was still uneasy when he was seriously injured, and he sent someone to guard the door. This can also be seen how important it is for Ling Zhongkuan to let his grandson enter Huyang Academy-but when this hope is shattered, Ling Zhongkuan's disappointment and irritation can also be imagined.
“Get out of here!"Ling Ling said coldly.
Snapped!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped it in the face, and said coldly: "What are you, tell you to roll or not?"”
What, I was slapped by a waste material?Zhang Yuan stroked his face in disbelief. This waste material dared to shoot him, and he was hit. What kind of joke is this?
Snapped!
Ling Han waved his hand again, and slapped him firmly again.
“Baa-baa-baa-”
The sound of an acoustic sheep barking echoed in the silent mountains.
Li Qiye climbed up the mountain, the night wind was sharp and cold, but at this time he was sweating anxiously. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the mountains with his hands and feet, and the night looked particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night looked terrible, Li Qiye was anxious in his heart.
Li Qiye, he was born into a sharecropper family, and his parents were poor people. He started herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herds sheep as usual. However, when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that a sheep was missing. This made him anxious. He hurriedly returned to the mountains to look for it. However, he searched the entire mountains and found no sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of Zhang Datu's landlord and the loss of a sheep, Li Qiye was anxious and panicked.
Now that the whole mountain has been searched, there is no shadow of the sheep. At this time, Li Qiye thought of a place, and there was only one place he didn't look for-the Fairy Magic Cave!
Looking up at the night in the valley in front of him, he was like a wild beast, opening his mouth wide and choosing people to eat at any time. The sound of wolves crying and ghosts was faintly heard in his ears, overlooking the blurred night in the Fairy Magic Cave, Li Qiye couldn't help but shudder.
Fairy Demon Cave, a place with a fierce name in the local area, has a legend that there is a demon living in it. Anyone who enters will be eaten. After entering, no one will ever come out alive.
However, at this time, Zhang Dahu's crackling whip reverberated in Li Qiye's ears. If a sheep was lost, Zhang Dahu would definitely beat him to pieces!
“Okay, okay, okay, the immortal crow of this seat has finally been refined. It only lacks soul and soul. Today I just borrowed your soul for use!”I don't know how long it took, a deep and gloomy voice sounded in the Fairy Demon Cave.
“Pop--pop--pop--" After a while, a rapid flapping of wings sounded, and a strange crow-like bird flew out of the fairy magic cave.
“Fly, fly, this seat will borrow your soul to remember the burial place and fly over the ruins. As long as the nine realms are still there, this seat must be found!”In the Fairy Demon Cave, a deep and gloomy voice echoed.
Since then, between the heavens and the earth, there has been a Yin crow flying, entering the burial place, entering the immortal city, crossing the fierce realm... Involuntarily, flying over the nine realms, after all kinds of tribulations, for millions of years without death!
Time has passed, times have changed, invincible figures have risen one after another, and giants have fallen one after another. Slowly, I don't know when..., a mysterious crow began to appear for a while. A mysterious crow who had escaped from imprisonment began to look for a way to dominate his own destiny.
From the medicine god, to the Flying Immortal Emperor, to the Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, to the Mingren Immortal Emperor, to the Swallowing Sun Immortal Emperor, to the Bingyu Immortal Emperor... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants have risen, and generations of gods have fallen away, but, after tens of millions of years, that crow still faintly appears in the long river of time.
The cold wind is like a knife, and heavy snow is flying.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw himself sitting in a yellow-gray carriage. The carriage was shaking a little, and there was a little girl whispering beside him.
Outside the carriage, there were noisy and noisy human voices. There were shouts, shouts, and cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back. From an old man who was eating and waiting to die in a state-owned enterprise, he woke up to this world after getting drunk once.
It has been five days so far.
He sniffed his nose, and there was the smell of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit in the air.
“Oh, the white osmanthus wine in Osmanthus Square is getting more and more fragrant.”The personal maid in the carriage said softly.
In addition, he was born with a baby face and a small head. It looks no different from a ten-year-old child.
The little face is chubby, the white is red, wearing a small green cotton skirt, and the little hand is still rubbing the hair rope for Lu Sheng to get out of the car and tie his hair.
This kind of hair rope is made of a very expensive kind of cross bark, which will naturally emit a faint fragrance, but the only disadvantage is that it will become hard when it is cold, and it needs to be rubbed with hot hands to soften it.
Lu Sheng smiled and said nothing. The carriage stopped quickly.
He opened the car curtain and got out of the car. On the off-white street, there were pieces of bluestone bricks, each the size of a basin.
Cars came and went on the streets, and there were people holding Malays to and fro. The hawkers and the girls and women who came out to hang out were not taboo, showing up and laughing again and again.
Lu Sheng looked up at the wine shop in front of him. The white plaque is rectangular in shape, with three large characters written in the middle: Osmanthus Square.
“Inside please! The A-shaped wing is reserved for you!”A little guy greeted him with a pile of smiling faces.
Lu Sheng nodded, a rich son made a pie, took the silver-rimmed white paper fan from the small hand beside him, shook it lightly, and the fan unfolded. On it was painted a picture of the landscape and smoke waves. The landscape rises one after another, the light and the dark overlap, and there is also an inscription that shows everyone's style at first glance.
He followed the little guy into the wine shop with ease.
The wine shop is divided into two floors, and many people are sitting in the lobby on the first floor listening to people singing.
A girl in green stood crisply in the empty space, her voice soft, and there was a middle-aged woman playing the pipa next to her.
The song is a three-meeting biography, and the three-meeting biography is the poignant love between the general who went out and the fox girl in the mountains.
It's a pity that the drinkers present were all rough people, and only a few literati sons could understand them, and the rest turned a blind eye to the girl and the two of them.
Lu Sheng stopped, seeing that the first floor was so lively, he simply found a space on the first floor to sit down.
“Who ordered the three-meeting pass?"He asked the little guy casually.
His status in this osmanthus workshop is different. If this osmanthus workshop is equivalent to a high-end entertainment club on earth, then he is the supreme vip customer here.
Such expenses are already considered top customers in a small city in the north like Jiuliancheng.
“It's Prince Zhou. Zhou lacks the son of Zhou.”
Lu Sheng didn't embarrass him either, so he waved his hand and let him go.
After he took Xiaoxiao to sit down, he glanced around the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale and thin young man, dressed in white, holding a golden ruffled folding fan in his hand, gently shaking. .
“I guess I have a crush on the little girl who sings again."Lu Sheng shook his head.
“The eldest son only warned him last time, this guy is really a bad guy!"Xiao Xiao muttered dissatisfied.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Start listening to the song quietly.
A table of wine and vegetables was quickly served on the dark red wooden table, and Lu Sheng sandwiched a clip of fried shredded meat with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of white osmanthus wine that is about the same as the drink. The faint sweet floral fragrance is mixed together, just like drinking juice.
In Syracuse, in the north, ice shrimp is a specialty here. If you fish in the thick ice hole at will, you can make a large number of small translucent shrimp.
The body length of ice shrimp is half that of ordinary shrimp, but the taste is extremely delicious.
Of course, the price is also extremely expensive.
It's a luxury for ordinary people to eat once a month, and they can have it everywhere like him.
While Lu Sheng was eating food, drinking wine, and listening to a little song, he was thinking of other things in his heart.
He has been in this world similar to ancient China for so many days. But according to his observation, there are many oddities in this world.
At first he thought he had returned to ancient times, but then he found out that it was not.
The customs and customs here, as well as the festive climate, are far different from any dynasty area he knows.
Thinking about something in his heart, the door of the wine shop opened again.
A group of strong men in short-sleeved suits walked in one after another, found a table near the corner and sat down.
At first glance, these strong men knew that they were not locals. They dressed more like they had come from the Central Plains, and their clothes and temperament were not as rough as those of the North.
The strong man at the head was a bald head with copper earrings and a fleshy face, but at this time he sighed.” “
“Brother, what are you worried about? Lijiacun can't get through. We can take the second road, and it's okay to take a detour from Zhangcun."The other man frowned.
“What do you know, I walked from Zhangcun when I came to meet. The situation is similar to that of Lijiacun, and many people have died.”
“What the hell is going on, brother, tell your brothers to hear it, and let us gain insight.”A man urged.
The bald man sighed again. “I don't know exactly what happened. I only know that there have been accidents in several fishing villages by the lake of Suiyang. It seems that there are water ghosts.”
“？ Isn't that right?”
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and they could hear their unabashed chat.
Originally, he was just listening and playing, but he didn't expect these people to still talk about God and Dao.
The Lu family in his life is one of the largest in this Beidi Ice City, and his wealth is still small.
If you want to compare it on the earth, it is at least a rich person with assets of more than 100 million.
In the past few days, he has been out drinking. He has also heard a lot of rumors about monsters, gods and ghosts in the wine shop, but most of them are legends.
This is the first time that these people have had such a personal experience. So Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
Fortunately, those people didn't hide it either. Continue to talk loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
“That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes. It's more than a foot tall, with a green face and fangs, and covered with a lot of aquatic plants. Obediently, if it weren't for your eldest brother, I would run fast. Now you don't want to see me anymore."The bald head is still afraid now.
“Brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost?”A man doesn't believe it.
“I'm afraid it's not the story you made up, brother, right?”
Lu Sheng also felt funny when he heard this, and it is estimated that it was just a reckless man who came out of nowhere to brag. During this time, he has seen a lot of such people.
After eating and drinking, he asked the little guy to bring over the song list of the singer and browse it at will.
Although the Sanhui Biography is good, it is not suitable for the situation. He plans to change to a more cheerful one.
Snapped!
But at this moment, the bald man blushed and patted the table.
“That piece of bone that the water ghost fell on the ground! I secretly picked it up afterwards!”
He carefully took out a jade-like green stone from his arms and patted it on the table.
“Isn't this just a piece of miscellaneous jade!”A man laughed.
“Miscellaneous jade? Is this miscellaneous jade?
“This brother. Can you show me this thing.”
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of several people with a smile on his face, his gaze sweeping over the green jade on the table.
“Do you dare to ask for this thing? This is what the water ghost left behind.”The bald head said in surprise.
He just took it out to show off now, planning to throw it away in a while.
After all, this is not something left by people. If the water ghost is really going to cause trouble, then the gain is really not worth the loss.
“I'll just take a look."Lu Sheng doesn't believe in water ghosts, he just sees that the jade looks good, unlike ordinary miscellaneous jade.
You must know that ordinary miscellaneous jade can be bought everywhere in the stalls in the shop. It is the scraps of jade that are polished at will, and the price is extremely cheap.
But for some reason, as soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
White fox fur in Tsing Yi, wearing a jade officer's hat, and moire black boots embroidered with silver thread.
All the clothes can be spent in this osmanthus workshop for several months. It's even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
“The son wants it, but it's not impossible, uh....Just a tael of silver!”
Lu Sheng asked Xiaoxiao to take out one or two pieces of silver and put it on the table.
The bald head decisively picked up the jade, and Lu Sheng stuffed it in his hand. Several people changed their eyes, got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't speak either, watching a few people leave, holding the jade in his hand, picking it up and taking a closer look.
“That is, I can be so rich in this life."He shook his head. One tael of silver is nothing to him. According to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses on weekdays are at least one hundred taels of silver. Occasionally, it may cost thousands of taels.
Thinking of this, he secretly said that he was a loser.
Holding the jade, he ignored the sight of the guests watching the excitement around him, but put his feet on the table and left the wine shop, walking towards the carriage waiting outside.
But just after leaving the wine shop, before he was halfway there, he was startled, picked up the jade and put it in the palm of his hand.
The jade was in the palm of his hand, in the palm of his right hand, and it melted.
The original hard stone, in just a few seconds, turned into a ball of dark green mucus, and a scream faintly came from the mucus.
The whole mucus suddenly exploded, turning into a cloud of green smoke, slowly drifting away from Lu Sheng's face.
He stood still in amazement, and when he glanced at it, the jade was still in his hand, but the green inside had disappeared quietly without knowing when.
He stood in a daze, constantly recalling the previous picture for a while.
Xiao Xiao kept calling him from the side.
Lu Sheng recovered and looked at the jade in his hand again. It was simply an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
“Let's go, go back to the mansion!”
The two got into the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and pumped it a few times, and the two long-haired dark horses walked slowly.
In the carriage, Lu Sheng didn't say a word, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hand. "At this time, I also found something strange about the stone.
“I was fooled again!"She muttered in her heart, and she didn't say much. The eldest son was pretty good this time. The biggest time he was cheated before was for a so-called antique wine jug, which cost thousands of taels of silver, and almost made the old man mad to death. This time it was only a tael of silver, and the young master sometimes had more than that for a meal.
The carriage went all the way back to the house. When passing by the gate of the city, Lu Sheng heard someone yelling outside.
“.....I heard that the water ghost was removed before! A Taoist from the tourist side helped to solve the danger of the fishing village!”
“Is there anyone from the court?”
“I came early, and I heard that even the Ouyang catcher of the prefect's yamen in the city almost fell into it. Fortunately, I met a Taoist Yunyou. It is said that as soon as the Taoist made a move, there was a flash of golden light, and the water ghost screamed in the warehouse, turned into green mucus, and then exploded into thick smoke and spread out.”
“Of course not!”
Lu Sheng heard that it was the officer guarding the city gate chatting.
He often deliberately passes by the city gate here. The officers and soldiers here are well-informed and like to brag about strange things everywhere.
“This is a coincidence...."Lu Sheng's face remained silent.
He recalled the jade stone before, his heart sank.
In the autumn of 9999 of the Shenzhou Calendar, Qingzhou City in the East China Sea.
Qingzhou Xuegong, the holy Land of Qingzhou City, the wealthy nobles of Qingzhou City, and more than half of the powerful people in the clan family all walked out of Qingzhou Xuegong. Therefore, people in Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the palace to practice. Once they have the opportunity to enter the palace, they must study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone has this awareness. At this time, in a schoolhouse in Qingzhou Xuegong, a young man was lying on the table and sleeping soundly.
Above the lecture hall, a girl in a long Tsing Yi dress also noticed this scene, and a touch of anger appeared on her pretty face, and she stepped towards the young man who was sleeping.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, an official disciple of Qingzhou College and a lecturer of outer disciples, has a beautiful face and a hot figure. In the schoolhouse, a pair of eyes moved with Qin Yi's moving posture. Even if he was angry, Qin Yi's steps were still elegant.
“This guy actually slept in Sister Qin's lecture hall again.”It seems that only then did I notice the sleeping posture, and many young people around were a little speechless. Obviously, this is not the first time.
“With Sister Qin's appearance and figure, even looking at her is enough to be pleasing to the eye. What exactly is in that guy's mind.”
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer. There is no one. As for the reason, you can understand as long as you see her. I don't know how many people regard her as a goddess. Her lecture hall has always been packed with students. So far.
Qin Yi's steps were very light, and she didn't make a sound when she walked to the boy's side. She stood at the table and looked at the sleeping face in front of her, her beautiful face covered with frost.
"Ye Futian.”A soft voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seemed that he heard someone calling him in his sleep. Ye Futian's body moved, holding his head with both hands, and he opened his eyes leisurely. Under his hazy gaze, he was greeted by undulating peaks.
“It's so big."Ye Futian couldn't help whispering. His voice was very soft, as if he was talking to himself. However, in the quiet environment at this moment, the voice was still very abrupt. In just an instant, many eyes solidified in the air, and then turned into anger again.
“How dare he...openly attack Senior Sister Qin?”
Angry glances seemed to turn into sharp swords, causing Ye Futian to shudder, as if he felt something was wrong, his gaze moved up along the seductive place, and then he saw a face as delicate as jade but full of anger. Face.
“Uh..." Ye Futian had a black line on his face, how could it be Qin Yi?
Looking back, he saw a fifteen-year-old pure girl glaring at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, then cursed secretly, and was killed miserably, no wonder the size was wrong.
“Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian. Qin Yi interrupted him indifferently and said, “In what context was Qingzhou Academy Founded?"”
Obviously, Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and change the subject, but Ye Futian could clearly feel her anger at the moment. He even faintly felt strands of sword intent flowing from Qin Yi's body, sharp and biting, tingling every inch of his skin.
“Three hundred years ago, the Great Emperor Donghuang unified the eastern Shenzhou and ordered the princes of the world to create the Martial Arts Palace to prosper martial arts. Qingzhou Palace was founded in this context."Ye Futian responded. Of course, what he was talking about was the historical record. There is another name in the wild history he has seen in the family. However, the taboo name is never allowed to be mentioned.
“What are the occupations of practicing?"Qin Yi asked again.
“Practice can be divided into martial arts and techniques. There are many occupations such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen in martial arts. Those who practice martial arts have many occupations such as mages, alchemists, and alchemists, and mages are divided into multiple departments. Of course, there are also talented people who practice both martial arts and martial arts."Ye Futian responded.
“You seem to have missed a profession."Qin Yi looked solemn and asked seriously.
A touch of sacred brilliance appeared on the young man's face: “The strongest profession recognized in China, those who are favored by God, the Mage of Destiny, have the talents given by God. Those with rare talents, such as summoners, beast masters, and star masters, most of them come from the Mage of Destiny. No matter how you practice martial arts, the Mage of Destiny can have stronger talents than others.”
Everyone around is fascinated, the master of destiny, the legendary profession, inherits the destiny, and is blessed by God. “Not only that, even a Master of Destiny is naturally suitable for both martial arts and martial arts.”
Qin Yi's eyes were wistful, then he looked at the young man in front of him, and said angrily: “I didn't expect you to know a lot about this.”
“Of course."Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously: "I am a master of Destiny."”
"Puff..." Not far away, a young man who was drinking water choked violently, coughing violently, and looked at Ye Futian with eyes around him, as if looking at an idiot.
There is such a brazen person in the world, who is worthy of being a legend of Qingzhou Xuegong. Not only did he openly molest Senior Sister Qin, but now he lied that he was a master of Destiny, in order to attract Senior Sister Qin's attention?
However, who is he? He has been practicing in the palace for three years. He has been wandering in the first realm of awakening and gathering qi. His body is weak. Obviously, the refining of the body has not been completed. Such a mediocre or even useless figure, saying that he is a destiny mage? Is this still shameless?
Qin Yi's chest ups and downs again, suddenly magnificent, she looked at Ye Futian angrily: "Since you are a master of Destiny, the Palace of Destiny has a soul, release your soul of Destiny for me to see.”
“My soul of life is still sleeping and cannot be summoned out. It is also because of the soul of life that I fell asleep in the lecture hall."Ye Futian responded calmly.
“Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted loudly, staring at the young man in front of him with beautiful eyes, and said: "Three years ago, you entered the academy at the age of twelve. At that time, I was still an outer disciple. I visited your talent test. Your perception of aura as a heavenly quality shocked the academy, and many teachers paid attention to it. However, in the next three years, I have not advanced an inch, and I have always stayed in the first reunion state of awakening, doing nothing all day long, being lazy, and not caring about it in the lecture hall. Have you practiced?”
“In the past three years, whether it is the spring Festival or the autumn Festival examination, you have abstained from all exams and directly ranked first in the bottom of the academy. Ye Futian, do you have any shame?”
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire school became silent, and the needles could be heard. Everyone's eyes stared at Qin Yi's excited face. It seemed that this was the first time they had seen Senior Sister Qin look like this.
Ye Futian seemed to be calmed down too, his dark eyes staring at the delicate face flushed with anger in front of him.
“Has it been three years?"Ye Futian whispered in his heart. He didn't expect that three years had passed before he knew it, and the guy in the Palace of Destiny hadn't changed at all, and he was a little surprised. Sister Qin, the sexy goddess of the iceberg, who had always been indifferent, had been paying attention to him. It has been since he stepped into the palace to detect the talent of Tianpin perception. It has already begun.
The space was dead silent, Qin Yimei stared at the young man in front of her, with a handsome face with clear lines and clean and deep eyes like stars. At the age of fifteen, except for her thin body, she couldn't pick out any other problems. In three or two years, she will be a beautiful man.
“Is my tone too heavy?""Qin Yi saw that the corners of Ye Futian's eyes seemed to be a bit lonely, and he couldn't help but secretly said in his heart, and his anger dissipated a little bit.
“There is still a month to go to the autumn and winter exams. If you still abstain or fail this time, even if you intercede for you for the rest of your life, it will be useless. Xuegong will no longer allow you to stay. Do you understand?"Qin Yi continued, the eyes of the people in the school condensed, it seemed that the school could not bear that guy anymore.
If so, I am afraid it will go down in the annals of Qingzhou Xuegong. After all, it is extremely rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Xuegong.
“He goes, I go.”At the end, an indifferent voice came, and many people looked at the young man sitting in the corner with complicated eyes, envy, jealousy, admiration, and fear.
“There has been a decision in the Xuegong, and there is no need to participate in next year's spring festival for the rest of his life. You can choose any one of the Xuegong War Tower, the Knights, and the Shufa Palace to practice. His future can no longer be affected by you."Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed. The fate of him and the rest of his life will eventually go in a completely different direction."
A faint smile was outlined at the corner of Ye Futian's mouth, a little cynically.
“Shut up..." Sitting in the back for the rest of his life, he stood up, his eyes shining with a bright sharp light, piercing Qin Yi.
“Sit down."Ye Futian didn't look back, he said lightly, his eyes stagnated for the rest of his life, looking at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words were an iron order to him.
“I decided............” With a slightly frivolous smile on Ye Futian's face, he looked at Qin Yi and said, “I have officially participated in this year's Autumn and winter exams.”
Behind, a bright light flashed in the eyes of the rest of his life.
After three years, is he finally serious?
Qingzhou Xuegong has been practicing for three years. Everyone in the Xuegong only knows that he is extremely talented for the rest of his life. He has a golden attribute, a high sense of perception, and a very high martial arts talent. However, although he is a disciple of the outside world, his realm is higher than that of many lecturers.
However, who really knows the sleeping boy?
“Your body is weak, and you are still stuck in the state of awakening the first reunion of Qi. Even if you participate in the autumn and winter exams, how can you pass it?"Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed in his heart. Even if he rises up now, he is afraid it will still be too late."
“What if it's over?"Ye Futian didn't seem to have any self-knowledge at all, and there was a strong self-confidence in his tone.
“If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future."Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed with a strange brilliance, looking at the shadow and hot figure in front of him, his eyes involuntarily looked where he shouldn't have looked, and he said weakly: “Can you do whatever you want?"”
“This guy, what do you mean by that...” Many people stared at Ye Futian.
“This shameless bastard, where do you look?”It seems that after noticing Ye Futian's eyes, many people have the urge to run away. He even dared to molest Senior Sister Qin?"
Qin Yi naturally noticed Ye Futian's eyes, and the sympathy that had just been born disappeared in an instant. Her beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian viciously, gritted her teeth and said, "You can do whatever you want!"”
Deep in the mountains and dense forests, ten thousand demons gather.
For the first time, all races put aside their grievances and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes...all kinds of monsters have arrived. For a while, the entire forest was full of all kinds of monsters, big or small, delicate or flirtatious voices. There were ten demon kings sitting on the top of the table, the top powerhouses of the demon world, but at this time there was the same heavy expression between the eyebrows.
“Dear demon clan, you must know what has happened here recently.”The Tiger clan has always been strong, and the Tiger King was the first to speak to calm down all the demons, “We belong to the same demon class. Under such crises, I think all races should throw away stereotypes and join hands in one voice to solve the current problems together."”
“What is the purpose?”
“Do you still have to guess about this?"Tiger King snorted coldly, "Except for the monks in the six sects and three sects, who would do such a thing." Have we had fewer monsters slaughtered by him over the years?”
“But we have always been clearly separated from these sects of cultivating immortals. Why did they suddenly stop me from going out of bounds?""The Fox King looked puzzled.
“I didn't eat the third son of their three sects and six sects."The Snake King also guessed, “They don't have to tear their faces like this, do they?"”
“That's it!"The Leopard King also said angrily, “I've been here like this for so many years. Which demon hasn't eaten a mortal. How could the three sects and six sects suddenly get into trouble?" I don't think it's them.”
“Yes, everyone knows that the demon spirit of our realm is detrimental to their cultivation, so they never approach the border forest, so how can they stay here on a special trip.”
“But...except for the six sects and three sects, who still has the strength to kill all the out-of-bounds demon races within three months."Tiger King still insists on his own ideas.
The Eagle King nodded, as if recalling something, his feathers shook, “I heard that all the demon races who went out of bounds died without bones, and there were those who were skinned and cooked. On the old trees in the forest, there are air-dried corpses. It's so cruel... animals are worse than animals.”
“It's too much bullying.“The Tiger King slapped the armrest of the stone chair with a palm, and stood up angrily, "Everyone, demon Kings, I think instead of guessing who did it here, it's better to kill it together and figure it out clearly." I don't believe it. No matter how high they are in cultivation, can they stop this army of ten thousand demons?”
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings suddenly showed expressions of approval. Indeed, instead of being frightened, it was better to take the initiative to attack.
The deer King was the first to respond, “My son died in their hands. Instead of guessing here, it's better to go out and have a good time." What about the three sects and six sects, when have we monsters ever been afraid of them!”
“Isn't that why we are gathered here today? Regardless of who he is, kill out to avenge the dead of his kind.”Even the least courageous Rabbit King stood up and responded, but the rabbit clan died the most.
“That's right, if you don't repay this hatred, you will be a demon in vain!”
“The demon soul of the tribe is on the top, and I will avenge it.”
The other demon kings also stood up one after another to respond, and even the demons of all races around them appeared one after another, with bright claws and bright claws, excitedly shouting the slogan of revenge, Yan Ran looked like the whole army was waiting to be sent.
“Then what...” A thin voice suddenly sounded in the demon group, “I don't think I need to go."”
In the wave of anger, an opposing voice suddenly appeared. Although the voice was not loud, it successfully attracted the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, the eyes of all the demons pierced in unison.
“Who is it?"The Tiger King let out a tiger roar, searching for this seedless monster.
The demons looked around, obviously they were the monsters with the sharpest five senses, but they hadn't found the person who made the sound for a long time.
“Who was the one who just spoke?"The Tiger King was a little angry, “Where did the demon come from?" Have the guts to stand up for this king!”
“I'm here, here!”
The demons patrolled the surroundings several times again, but still did not see who the person who made the sound was.
“Here, here...” The voice rose again, “Left, left, wrong...After a while, a little on the right, wrong, look here, look here!”
The demons followed the voice and looked around several times, but still did not find anyone who made a sound.
"Ugh! Forget it, I'm here!”
Until a sigh, a figure suddenly used both hands and feet to climb onto the high platform where the demon kings were sitting. Only then did the demons see the person who made the sound.
It was a woman wearing a gray fluttering robe, her shoulders were weak, her eyes were godless and she was pulling down. The whole person had a lazy temperament, she was very short and thin, and her face was still a little yellowish.
The word “weak" appeared in the minds of the demons at the same time, it was too weak! Even the demon aura on her body was pitifully weak, as if any demon breath could blow her away.
It's no wonder that the demons hadn't found this person after searching for a long time just now. Such a demon was really inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King suddenly couldn't see it. The tiger snorted and said fiercely, “Huh, you seedless kid, just a few monks scared you, and you became like this.""Monsters can be transformed, but this is the Ten Thousand Monsters Conference, so most of the demon races here have revealed some prototypes to distinguish races. Only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the Tiger King even more unpleasant, "I dare not show people in their original form, what kind of demon are you?"” "I am human.”
“I am human.”The woman replied.
“Shemale?"Tiger King was taken aback for a moment, “What kind of demon is a shemale?" Never heard of it!”
“Why do all the weak monsters in a mess dare to come to the Ten Thousand Monsters Conference."The Tiger King glared at the woman angrily, “You seedless little demon, you have to talk nonsense here, which affects the morale of me waiting for revenge."”
“No, I'm serious."The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders drooped unconsciously, looking weaker, “You really don't need to go out and find someone to avenge."”
“Still talking frustrated words!"The Tiger King became angry and yelled, "Believe it or not, I ate you little demon."”
“If you eat me, there is no need to come for nothing?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, the guy you just said killed all the monsters and was inferior to animals..." She sighed, patted the gray robe and raised her head, still listless, but pointed to her nose and said, "Maybe...it's me!"”
The audience was quiet for three seconds, and there was no sound.
“Kill her!”
The ten thousand demons who reacted rushed towards the woman at the same time.
Small animals or something-it's so troublesome!
Five minutes later.
——The first and last Ten Thousand Demon Conference is over!
Chapter One Tony ·Dunn?
The huge noise stimulates the nerves of the brain, and the decibels can cause deafness. A dazzling white light shot into his eyes, and the sun was bulging and painful.
Tang En couldn't help but squinted his eyes, but the white light did not disappear, but spread to the whole world.
What the hell is going on? Am I in the rock and roll scene?
Dunn cursed in his heart and opened his eyes, but what rushed into his eyes was a big scary face. A face covered with sweat and black, the heat from the two black holes under the wide nose seemed to have touched his face. The white teeth in the big cracked mouth are as terrifying as wild animals, and of course there is bad breath spewing out of it.
The next step was a fierce, head-on collision. Dunn felt as if he had been hit in the chin by a heavy punch, and his whole body fell backwards.
The weight of the two people pressed on those poor plastic bottles, and they were overwhelmed and disintegrated. White water splashed out, and even a column of water shot out of the mouth of a certain bottle and soared directly to the face of the “pool fish” behind, and the other “pool fish” rose into the sky like frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!”
“Damn it!”
“What's going on?”
“Team doctor, team doctor!”
“How did you kick it?”
Dunn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the strange faces surrounding him. Some of them looked anxious, others gloated, and others covered their faces and couldn't see their expressions. The surroundings are still noisy, but the huge hustle and bustle just now has changed its tone, and there are boos and laughter in it.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on?
Wait, let's see what happened on the sidelines?”The commentator of the live broadcast suddenly became excited. He stood up and looked down from the top stand. “The main striker of the Forest team, David Johnson, was knocked into the coaching seat on the sidelines during a fight with the opposing player. Poor Tony. Coach Dunn happened to be standing on the sidelines directing the game...Oh! Look at the tragedy on the ground, this is really a collision between Mars and the earth!
Dunn was lying on the ground, his light gray suit was drenched, crumpled with grass and dirt, and looked like a rag that had just been used.
A man with a big nose and a black beard who looked a bit like Mario appeared in his field of vision. He quickly took out his white gloves from the back-colored leather bag he was carrying and put them on, and then began to check Dunn's body.
Hell, he seems to have landed on the back of his head!
“Can you hear me?"He stretched out his hand and shook it in front of Dunn's eyes, his tone obviously much more anxious than just now.
At the same time, the scene just now began to be played repeatedly on the TV screen.
David ·Johnson was pushed hard by the opponent in a fierce fight with the opponent on the 14th, and then the big black rushed obliquely towards Tony·Dunn, who was standing on the sidelines. But the strange thing is that Dunn could have avoided it. He had plenty of time, but at this time he stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his team members crash into him.
A scene. The Forest players anxiously surrounded the coach's seat. The center of the crowd was naturally Dunn lying on the ground, and the black forward David Johnson, who had made a mistake, knelt on the ground and kept praying. If something happens to his coach, he will be the first player to kill his head coach on the court.
Unlike the tension of the Forest players, most of their opponents stand in the stadium and watch the show with their arms around them. There are also curious people who take on the responsibility of being spies for the whole team, running to see the excitement, and then running back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to be worried about the life and death of their head coach. They were taking this opportunity to curse their team's bad performance loudly. Various words starting with “F” or “s” burst out of their mouths, and countless high middle fingers set off the “0:2” on the big screen. Particularly dazzling.
The team doctor of the Forest team, Gary·garyF1eming, is still doing his best. He clearly saw Tony's eyes move just now, why didn't he respond again?
He patted Tony Dunn's face, still unresponsive.The team's acting head coach lay on the ground like a wax figure, his mouth slightly open and his eyes wide, as if he had seen something very surprised.
The blue sky, the marshmallow-like white clouds, the faces with different skin tones and expressions, and the noisy environment are all familiar, but they are so strange, as if they are thousands of miles away from themselves.
The referee motioned to the team doctor to watch and deal with it by himself. He could not suspend the game endlessly because of off-field injuries. He whistled for the players to return to the field, and the game continued, even though the Forest players had no intention of fighting.
“But he may even be in danger of his life!"Flemming was very angry at the indifference of the referee. He pointed to Dunn, who was still lying on the ground, and yelled at the referee.
“Then you call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!”The referee pushed back without showing weakness, "Moreover, he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you said.""He pointed behind Flemming, then ran back to the court.
Flemming turned around and went back to see Dunn standing up slowly touching the back of his head, and he hurriedly went up to help him. “How are you feeling, Tony?”
Dunn asked blankly: "Where is this?”
Flemming turned around and swore, it's been really unlucky these days. “Des, Des, come here!"He beckoned for a golden man on the coach's seat to come over.
The man named “Des” ran over. “How about Tony?”
“It's terrible. He even asked me where is this just now?”
Des's reaction was the same as that of Flemming just now, and he also turned his head and cursed.
“I suspect this is the result of the impact on the back of his head when he fell to the ground just now.”
“Is it bad, Gary?"Des bit his lip, with a solemn expression on his face.
“I don't know, maybe it's good, maybe it's bad."Flemming shook his head.
“What does that mean?”
“In a good situation, he only loses his memory for a short time, and he will recover after a break. Bad situation... do you still need me to say?”
Des waved his hand, indicating that he understood.“Take him to the hospital? But now the game is still going on, and we are behind, and we need him to command the game..." As he said, he turned his head and glanced at Tony Dunn next to him, but he was surprised to find that Dunn was slowly moving towards the player passage alone.
"Hey!"Des hurriedly dropped Flemming and ran forward to hold his colleague.
“Tony, where are you going?”In the noisy environment, Des's yelling with his teeth and claws actually only had the effect of “whispering.”
Dunn turned his head and looked at Des blankly. This look made Des look chilling. Now the afterglow of the sunset above their heads was golden, but he couldn't see any brilliance flowing in those eyes.
“Tony, where are you going?"Des repeated again.
“I...I don't know, maybe...it's going home...” Dunn murmured, still trying to break free of Des's hand.
Flemming also ran over from one side: “Tony, you can't go home now. We are playing, you are the head coach, you have to command the team!”
The pulling of the three people at the entrance of the passage attracted the attention of the substitutes of the two teams and the stands, and even the players on the field glanced here from time to time.
Dunn suddenly smiled: “I'm the coach?”This is ridiculous. How could I be a coach... Although I am a fan and often play football manager games, how could I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a damn nightmare!
Flemming said next to him like introducing the two people who met for the first time: “He is Des, Des·Walker (desa1ker). The former England international, who played as a central defender on the field, only retired from the team last season. Now he is your colleague and your assistant.”
Dunn nodded, and then said to Des: "Okay, now you are commanding the game for me, I am going to rest."After speaking, he broke away from Des's hand, regardless of the huge boos and two stunned people behind him, and walked into the passage.
Flemming looked at Dunn's back, and then at Des·Walker.
Walker sighed heavily, turned and walked back. “This game can't be played anymore!”
Dunn sat in the passage, with his back against the wall, looking at the surrounding environment blankly. On the white wall opposite him is a huge sign. Below the big red “mushroom” are three wavy curves, and below it is an English word: Forest.
Where am I going? What the hell is going on?
Dunn touched the back of his head, where there was still a faint pain.
***, Sneak up on Lao Tzu, hit Lao Tzu behind!
“What's my name?"He murmured to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth.It wasn't until this time that he realized that he had always spoken bird language-English.
“***, how did this happen?”
Dunn, who finally understood where he was, stayed again, which was so incredible that his brain stopped responding after the load operation.And all this seems to have nothing to do with him anymore.
The above is the scene that took place at the City Stadium this afternoon. Tony Dunn, the acting head coach of the Forest team, was knocked down by his players while standing on the sidelines, and then seemed to fall into a brief coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the player passage.
Through the faint light of the street lamp outside, Dunn stood in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror.A middle-aged ghost with a tall nose, deep eyes, blue eyes, and brown slightly curved head.
In fact, Tang En, who is from Sichuan, China, is only 26 years old. At this moment, the person in the mirror even has a head tattoo!Thirty-four years old! This is Tony·Dunn's age.
Not only did he lean over to an Englishman inexplicably, he also traveled forward for four years and three months!
Although he never felt that he was handsome, he could attract the favor of many women.
He roared at the mirror, and then smashed the mirror with a punch. The self in the mirror suddenly became countless, and the fragments fell to the ground with a splashing sound, and countless faces looked at Dunn, as if laughing at him.
Dunn felt a little dizzy, so he took a step back and leaned against the smooth wall, gasping for breath.
Dunn, who had been quietly in the dark for a few minutes, gradually calmed down, and he decided not to think about such a complicated issue first.He has a habit in China, once he encounters something unpleasant, he goes to find a place to drink. There are bars everywhere in Chengdu, maybe you can find a one-night stand or something by the way. He habitually regarded Nottingham as Chengdu in his heart, and decided to go out and find a bar to drink to drown his sorrows.
Taking a look at the gloomy sky outside, he put on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
“After losing to the underdog Walsall 0:3 at home, the Forest team has indeed been unlucky recently. Paul Hart, who had high hopes, did not bring good results to the team. He submitted an application for resignation to team chairman nige1doughty after the last round of the game, and it was quickly approved.”
Today's sports news is being broadcast on the TV fixed on the elevated, and the focus is naturally on everything that happens on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There was a burst of boos in the noisy bar.
A drunk man raised his middle finger at the TV set. “That Tony ·Dunn, I know him! A little hairy boy who used to be an assistant to Paul Hart in the youth team.”
When the drunk man had just finished his tirade, Dunn just pushed the door in. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the people who were drinking and chatting in the bar. Everyone set their sights on the door. When they saw who the person who came in was, they were first surprised, and then a playful smile appeared on their faces. Smile.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with a wine glass in his hand and shouted, “Our coach Tony Dunn is here!”
“Woohoo!“The people in the bar booed ”welcome".
“Cheers to his beautiful defense of Johansson's breakthrough off the court!”The middle-aged man raised the wine glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately agreed and raised the wine glass in his hand. “Cheers!
Another man who was obviously drunk stood up crookedly, walked up to Dunn, held a beer bottle in his hand to his mouth, and asked with a hiccup: "Tony · Coach Dunn, it was a beautiful defense, but the referee and public opinion obviously don't...Neither think so...Uh!
After asking, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So he pushed away the wine bottle in front of him with a gloomy face. Then he walked straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside: "Please have a bottle...” He habitually wanted to say a bottle of "Xiao Er”-a small bottle of Erhuotou. Although he is from Sichuan, he went to university in the north and has liked this kind of strong wine since then-but he found that he couldn't speak “Xiao Er” in English, and more importantly, he quickly realized that it was in the UK, not in China. He lowered his head and muttered a curse, then changed his words: "Come to the strongest wine.”
The other people who had been observing him heard him say that he wanted the strongest wine, and they all heckled loudly.
“Yo! Tony the coward actually drinks too?”
The young bartender was a little at a loss in the face of these excited guests. He wanted to get the wine but was stopped by the drunks: “Get him the juice!" juice!”
“No, no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!”
“Ahaha!”
The owner of this bar was alarmed by the noise outside. He came down from upstairs and stood at the entrance of the stairs. He saw almost all the guests who had not fallen asleep on the table surrounded by the bar. In front of them sat a man wrapped in a black windbreaker, laughed at by the drunks.
His loud voice suddenly quieted the tavern. The drunks who were still arrogant just now suddenly calmed down when they saw the people standing behind them.
Dunn felt strange, who could make this group of people honest with just one sentence? He turned his head slightly and saw a man coming out of the shadow of the stairway.
The young bartender quickly pointed to Dunn and said to the man, “Boss, he wants a spirit.”
After the visitor saw clearly who was sitting, he was a little surprised, but he still said, "Just give it to him.”
“But...but they didn't let...” The bartender looked at the drunks who had returned to their seats in embarrassment.
The man looked around the bar, but anyone who was swept by his gaze must lower their heads, either pretending to be asleep or drinking hard with their heads down. Dunn became more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
“I don't think anyone has any objection. Pour him a glass of Scotch. It's my treat."The bar owner turned his head and asked Dunn, “Single or double?"”
The drunks laughed as they watched the excitement next to them.
The bar owner also laughed. “I forgot who you are..." He poured half a glass of golden whiskey into the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then he handed it to Dunn: “This is the wine from my hometown.”
Dunn took a sip and immediately coughed. He rarely drank foreign wine. What's more, this pure Scotch whiskey has a strong coke flavor.
There was a burst of schadenfreude laughter in the bar.
“The Tony I know · Dunn never drinks alcohol and lives like a true traditional Puritan. And he won't look at me like this now, don't you know who I am?”The man stared at Dunn, and Dunn found that he seemed to be seen through everything by this man.
He had to find a way to hide himself. “Uh...me”, Dunn lowered his head and took another sip. This time he didn't dare to let the liquor stay in his throat for an extra second, and swallowed it directly. The uncomfortable feeling was really lighter.
There was another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head to express his understanding.
Someone next to him helped Dunn untie the siege, and a voice shouted: "It seems that our Coach Tony has really broken his head! The person sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, the hero of the two-time European Champions Cup, and the winner of the 1978 Stanley·Matthews Award, Mr. Kenny· Burns (kennyBurns)! He is a hundred times stronger than your stupid donkey!”
The people behind him laughed loudly, ”Stupid donkey, stupid donkey" screamed non-stop, but the object of his ridicule slammed back his hand and splashed out the only half glass of wine left in his hand. The golden Scotch whiskey shone brightly under the light, drawing a beautiful arc in the air, and then accurately shot on the face of the unlucky guy-precisely and beautifully like David Beckham's right-footed free kick. "Boom!”
His swearing was smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Dunn pounced on the opponent with the wine glass in a way that no one else could think of. He couldn't bear this breath anymore. He came to this place inexplicably, traveled forward inexplicably for four and a half years, and was ridiculed and insulted inexplicably... He now wants to find someone to vent, whether he is defeating others or others defeating him.
The two hit the table behind them, and the empty wine bottle fell and shattered to the ground in a crisp sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect Tony Dunn, who was still like a coward just now, to suddenly explode.
The first person to react was the bar owner Kenny Burns. He pushed the fat man standing next to the bar and shouted, "What are you doing standing silly?" Pull them away!”
In addition to the tragedy on the ground, blood had already oozed from the forehead of the beaten person, and a red circle appeared there, which was the mark of the mouth of the cup. In addition, he received a punch on his left cheek, as red as if he was drunk.
And Dunn, except for messing up his head and clothes, there was nothing. He seemed to have already vented his anger when he was pulled up, and he didn't have the posture to rush up and chase. He sorted out his clothes and head, and then spat at the unlucky ghost who was held up by his companion: “I don't care who the fuck you are, don't mess with me."”
Then he turned to Burns and said, “I'm sorry for making a mess of your place. Today too***......” He was annoyed when he remembered that he had been crossed, “Another day...I will personally apologize, please don't worry about compensation.”
Then without waiting for the owner of the bar to say anything, he turned and walked to the door. When he passed the fat man, he also sneered: “Leave your milk to yourself, fat pig.”
Everyone watched him push the door out, but no one thought of stopping him, so they watched him leave, leaving a mess.
There was silence in the bar.At this time, the drunk drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room of people and a mess, and asked in confusion: “Did I miss anything?"”
I don't want to be a ghost! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Dunn shout like that?
Since my “previous life” is quite bad, why not use this opportunity to have a different life from the past? Although he has never been a football coach, he has also watched football for more than ten years. He has played football manager games in every generation. He knows a lot about the nature of some coaches' work. Isn't this a good opportunity to challenge?
He stopped thinking about the boring question of why God chose him.He now just needs to consider how to be more like a real professional coach. Although it will be difficult, it is worth trying.
“Hey, buddy.You broke into my house without my permission. I said dozens of times. If you don't leave, I will call the police!"An old voice suddenly sounded next to him.
Dunn glanced blankly at the old man standing opposite. He was holding many, many newspapers in his arms and holding a half-bitten burger in his hand.
“This...is your home?"He pointed to the bench below him.
“Of course.”
“Ah, sorry to interrupt..." Dunn stood up from the chair, the other party immediately sat down, and then lay down. Cover yourself with the newspapers in your arms, and then press them firmly between the back of the chair and your body.
Looking at the beggar who was contentedly eating a burger and lying in the "newspaper nest“, Dunn even thanked God for not letting himself be ”possessed" by him. Fate treats him not badly.
A taxi disembarked in front of him, he walked forward quickly, and then got in. Dunn took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying “dinner” in the car, and asked the driver to take him back to that strange home.
Starting today, a brand new world is slowly unfolding before Dunn's eyes.On Saturday morning, it was sunny and sunny, and Zhao Yao was walking on the way to sterilization......On the way to sterilize his domestic cat.
In the cat bag in his hand is a yellow raccoon flower cat, also known as an orange cat, one of the pastoral cats. The head, back, and limbs are all covered with layers of yellow and orange markings.
On the chest and stomach are large areas of fluffy white hair, and the tips of the limbs are white. It is said that this kind of snow-white gloves has a spike effect on girls and will control their brain waves and make them make “ah~~ah~~” sounds.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and a very girly appearance.
At this time, the cat was making a heartbreaking howl. The vast majority of domestic cats are very, very homely, and they are only willing to stay at home for the rest of their lives. Moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao only kept comforting the cat by making a sound.
At the same time, outside the earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly traversed outer space and gradually flew over China. The surface of the meteor flickered with a strange luster, as if it was constantly releasing some kind of ray into the surrounding void. Rays.
In Xingxing Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag at the front desk: “Male cats are sterilized. I have made an appointment before, and my surname is Zhao.”
“You haven't been to us before looking at the records. You need to fill in the information column of the medical record card.”
In outer space, the meteor slowly passed over the land of China and began to move in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Where the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies, and a deep luster flashed in their eyes, just like the luster emitted by the meteor.
At this moment, Matcha suddenly moved, jumped up struggling, and rushed towards the gate of the hospital.
The little nurse let out a scream, but Zhao Yao on the side suddenly rushed out and grabbed Matcha who had escaped.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow, and he couldn't catch Matcha's body, but just grabbed Matcha's tail.
When the tail was caught, Matcha let out a roar, and instinctively turned his head to take a bite at Zhao Yao. This is the instinct of cats, and the speed is also extremely fast. In an instant, a hole was opened on the back of Zhao Yao's hand. Zhao Yao felt a pain in the back of his hand and immediately released his palm.
Perhaps knowing that he was in trouble, Matcha did not continue to run away, but curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some uneasiness.
Zhao Yao hugged Matcha and said, "Silly cat, what are you biting, have you rebelled?"”
Matcha Cat's gaze suddenly flashed with a faint light, and the trace of blood on her teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt that his head suddenly fainted, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but he was taken aback when he saw it. The back of his hand was smooth, and there was no wound or blood.
The little nurse on the side took the cat and comforted her: “Obediently, it's okay, it'll be fine in a while, don't be nervous.”
This cry was heard in Zhao Yao's ears, but it was not a simple cat call, but turned into understandable words.
Zhao Yao pointed to the cat in front of him in shock, and said with a look of surprise: “This...this...this cat is talking!”
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you okay?”
“Didn't you hear it?"Zhao Yao said quickly: "It...it's talking."”
The little nurse frowned, and Zhao Yao's eyes became weirder and weirder as she looked at him.
“Can you understand me?”
“Take me home!”
“Woohoohoohoo, scared to pee~Meow.”
Zhao Yao suddenly opened his mouth wide, looked at the little nurse who was still comforting Matcha without feeling anything, then looked at Matcha and said, “Can you understand me?"”
“I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, take me home, woohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohoo”
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more weird.
Ignoring the strange gaze of the little nurse, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into his bag, trotting all the way out of the hospital.
In the rental house, Matcha Cat returned to the familiar environment and immediately relaxed, lying on the coffee table and began to lick her little white hands, her eyes narrowed, her face leisurely. For cats, licking hair is always a very suitable behavior for relaxation.
At the coffee table, Zhao Yao stared at the matcha cat in front of him, and tentatively said, “Can you still talk?"”
As he said, he stood up and said eagerly: “Does the master want to play a game?"”
“Eh, this... wait and play again. Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said at a loss: "When did you learn to speak?"”
Looking at the innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao looked weird.
Matcha Cat didn't feel weird at all about the situation in front of her. She suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted her eyes and rubbed Zhao Yao's body, and said in a milky voice, “Play games with me."”
Looking at the matcha cat who spoke like a five-year-old child in front of him, Zhao Yao touched the other's head, and the latter purred in enjoyment.
“In terms of calculations, you are only one year old, but now you are only five years old as a human being.“A smile appeared at the corner of Zhao Yao's mouth: "He's still a child, so it seems good."”
A month later, at nine o'clock in the night.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes casually, and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lives in is only 30 square meters, it is fully decorated and home furnishing. It is the house of a newly married couple in the past, and it is very close to the company, so he doesn't have to worry about traffic problems when he works overtime every day, so although the rent is not cheap, it still makes Zhao Yaozhi willing.
After Zhao Yao lay down, Matcha Cat unknowingly crawled to his side and rubbed his arm with his head, looking affectionate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed Matcha's head, the latter showing an expression of enjoyment.
But at this moment, the mobile phone on the sofa was also pushed over by Matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, her slender white arms resting on her small head, her long black satin hair hanging gracefully in the air, revealing her half-girly face, um, hot, so hot.
What's going on?
There was a steady stream of dry heat in her body that burned her little face and made her feel uncomfortable. Today, she came to the imperial Capital from Yecheng and just drank a glass of plain water from Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
“It's not good, Tang Mo'er jumped down, go after her, you can't let her run away!"”
Tang Mo'er was so excited that she was awake for more than half of the time, and Han Xiaowan actually designed her!
What should I do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man as if he had caught a lifeline, “Sir, help me, I have been drugged, and there are a few men behind me who want to explode me."”
The man's deep, cold, narrow eyes crossed the girl and glanced at the men behind him. Although his eyes were light, they made people shudder.
Those men were gangsters and had seen some of the world. They had seen the man who covered the headlines of the entire financial magazine and controlled the lifeblood of the entire imperial capital's economy on TV.
Gu Mohan.
They absolutely couldn't afford this man, so they turned around and ran away. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle is being staged. Angels with flaming wings, knights in heavy armor, and crusaders with golden swords are fighting against a group of bone dragons covered in black smoke, hideous and terrifying death knights, and an evil army composed of countless skeletons.
The battlefield of the fighting between the two sides is not in a plain full of war and smoke or a burial ground full of bones, but in a dark and invisible darkness. This is undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what's even weirder is that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, how many faint voices can be heard whispering?
“Operate it, hurry up and operate it! My goodness!”
“When talking about others, let's control your death Knight first! The death Knight and the mobile bunker are fighting! ！”
“Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy?”
After the battle, the angels, knights, and skeletons that originally existed on the battlefield also disappeared into the darkness of the background, and it once again returned to the state of absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened. As usual.
But several voices continued to communicate, and even more other voices joined in.
“My teammates are simply a bunch of pigs!Every dog is better than them! Not only does it not help the situation at all, but it also robs the command of the core troops...”The voice that failed before said a little unwillingly.
“Bah!It is clearly because the undead creatures are too weak. If they were replaced by my demon army, it would definitely be different..."The other voice also counterattacked without showing weakness, and made such a forceful defense for his wrong command: “I thought the Death Knight could easily get rid of those bunkers."”
After hearing this voice, there were a few chuckles in the dark, and the two sides of the argument suddenly lost their temper, and said helplessly to the victorious side: “The skills are not as good as others, so bow down.”
And the winner actually made a round of unassuming ridicule at this time?
“Haha! Justice will eventually defeat evil!”
“In front of our strength, whether it is the undead or the devil, even the gods will kill you!”
Such words are undoubtedly even more irritating. The two sides who had calmed down suddenly launched a new round of scolding, and the third person on the victorious side who was free from this new battlefield asked helplessly: "Shouldn't I organize this round of games?"”
It turns out that the previous tragic and heroic battle turned out to be just a game?
A voice who did not participate in this game responded: “It's amazing to be able to simulate a realistic war with consciousness, so that we onlookers seem to be in the immersive environment. You are really good at surprising us, I hope your excellency.”
And this guy known as Hope faced the opponent's sudden gratitude and replied in a low-key manner: “You are flattered, this is just a pastime.”
Yes, that battle, which was like a life-and-death duel between the righteous and evil camps, was nothing more than a pastime, and it could only add a little fun to this endless prison.
This is the void realm outside the reality plane. It should be a Jedi realm that is always dark, cold, and silent. No creatures will survive. It is a realm that is more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, this dead place that is difficult to accommodate any creatures, but a group of indeterminate creatures survive tenaciously. They have lost their flesh, and only the last consciousness remains in this void.
They called themselves Void Walkers and were imprisoned forever in this prison called Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the top powerhouses of all races and fields, the mages who reached the apex of the demon Dao, the warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the missionaries of perseverance and purity, the demons who dominate hell, the lich who controls the soul, etc., etc., they have left their names in the history of all levels.
Many people think that they have long since died out. Only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they don't know that this group of old monsters who are strong enough to be described as perverted are actually imprisoned in the endless void outside the plane. They have already spent incalculable years there, and it seems that they will be imprisoned here forever. The seemingly thin barrier between the reality plane and the void is the wall of sighs that they can never break through, even if the power they once possessed is so powerful, they are helpless about it.
But they never gave up hope of getting out of trouble, because there is an extremely special existence among these 33 Void walkers, and that is the fifth walker codenamed Hope.
Hope, formerly known as Bai Yi, did not come from the big and small planes of human existence outside the void, but from a weird place called the Earth. He was an editor of a small news website during his lifetime. His daily job is to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then change it to a new one. Shocking!
Titles such as men will cry and women will be silent are then published on their own websites, a noisy and boring job.
Later, Bai Yi, who was born and died in an accident, did not immediately disappear from his consciousness. Instead, he entered this mysterious void under the shadow of the sun and met several other void walkers. In the end, he survived so strongly until this moment.
The void walkers insist that he from different worlds will be the key to getting out of this endless prison, “Only you are different. If you want to leave here, you are our only chance. I firmly believe this, so I use the code name Hope to call you.”The first walker of the Void, the one codenamed the magician, once said to him like this.
They have always firmly believed in this, believing that they will be able to see the sun again one day, even if they have been imprisoned for countless times, hundreds of years? Thousands of years?
If you want to persist in this eternal prison for thousands of years without going crazy, it is obviously not enough to just chat or discuss. In fact, the most important means for void walkers to spend time is an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on a consciousness technique called memory backtracking. After using memory backtracking, people can recall every detail they have experienced, and even every punctuation in the newspaper can be clearly recalled. .
Then through a certain degree of editing, remove some memories that you don't want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your right and left hands, and then exchange the memories with each other. This is tantamount to enjoying a long movie about someone else's life. This is a great way to kill time.
The memories of the thirty-three void walkers are tantamount to letting him experience thirty-three lives. Even if he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid confusion in his memory, only their knowledge and experience were retained, but his state of mind was also in the experience of these thirty-three lives. Sifted away the weaknesses of childishness and impetuosity, became mature and calm, and was no longer the ordinary person on earth.
That's why he was given high hopes by other void walkers, but these countless years have passed, and even he can't find any opportunity to break away. The only thing he can do is to make this boring time a little less boring. It's just that.
At the same time, at this time, the reality plane is about to usher in the advent of night. When the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire Xiansai College, the students finally ended the day's heavy schoolwork, accompanied by young and energetic laughter and laughter, strolling in twos and threes on the tree-lined paths in the college.
Miya, a second-year student in the soul armor department, is also one of them. She has a cute and pretty face, long black hair combed into two equally cute double ponytails, and she is wearing the standard uniform of Xiansai College. After a simple farewell to her classmates, she came to the square of the college alone, found a bench to sit down at will, and then took out some of the remaining half of the dinner from her jacket pocket, carefully tore the bread into a little bit of crumbs, and then sprinkled it on the bluestone floor of the square.
After a while, there was a sound of wings flapping in mid-air, and several white pigeons quickly fell to Mia's feet, pecking at the breadcrumbs she sprinkled, while making a cooing cry, Mia squatted down cautiously, and her long ponytail swept gently to the ground with her movements. She quietly looked at this group of pigeons that she had long been familiar with, with a gratifying smile on her face.
Beautiful girls, docile white pigeons, and a square with several statues standing quietly, in line with the surrounding lush vegetation, under the last golden afterglow of the setting sun, they all converge into a beautiful picture.
This is what Mia does every day, and this is also the most relaxing moment of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life in Xiansai College, an institution of higher learning, will always be extremely hard.
“It's almost dark, let's get here today, I have to go back to practice, goodbye, gentlemen pigeons."Mia kept a relaxed smile on her face and said goodbye to the group of pigeons. Then she stepped away from her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under the skirt of her short uniform and hurried back to her dormitory.
The evening is also a very important study time, especially for a talented student like Mia, the effort required is not as easy as the smile on her face that seems to hang forever.
1.Chapter 1
In the Su family mansion, in the huge martial arts arena, the awakening ceremony of the martial soul is being held.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, is the son of the elder of the Su family and has outstanding talents.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the patriarch of the Su family, completed the nine-fold quenching body at the age of fourteen, and is known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, then with Su Mo's talent, the awakened martial soul will inevitably not be worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo could also awaken martial souls above the fifth level of human level, then the Su family would be able to appear two top geniuses this time, and the future development of their Su family would be very important.
When the presiding elder called out the name, the shocked disciples, elders and others in the audience all looked at the handsome young man next to them. In their eyes, the meaning of expectation was extremely strong, even surpassing Su Yu before. .
Sumo's expression was calm, and he raised his steps and walked to the altar.
Su Yu, who walked down the altar, looked proud and smiled coldly at Su Mo, his eyes full of provocation.
Su Mo ignored the other party, took a deep breath, and sat cross-legged with his eyes closed.
From under the altar, a stream of talisman light immediately floated out, constantly drilling into Sumo's body.
His talent is the top existence in the Su family, and he completed his physical training at the age of fifteen. His talent is not bad. However, he was always overwhelmed by Sumo.
At this time, more and more runes flickered on the altar, wrapping Sumo's body.
Sumo, who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, was breathing slightly short, and from his body, bursts of roar gradually sounded.
Everyone stopped breathing, staring at the altar!
Boom!
Finally, there was an explosion, and a dark phantom suddenly rose up. The dark phantom was like a black hole, slowly rotating inside, bottomless, giving people a sense of coldness.
At the same time, a yellow halo flashed above the phantom.
Ah!
In an instant, everyone in the audience's eyes immediately became sluggish.
An aura?
The lowest level of martial soul?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu was dumbfounded and stunned.
Because, he had no idea that the first day of the Su family actually awakened only the first-level martial soul, the lowest-level martial soul!
Su Mo sat cross-legged on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, and he was startled when he saw his martial soul.
“The first-level martial soul of the human level...!"Su Mo murmured to himself, with a wry smile at the corner of his mouth. He didn't expect that he had awakened a lowest-level martial soul!"
The most rubbish martial soul?” "Actually awakened an abandoned martial spirit!"
“What the first day is, it is simply the first waste of my Su family.”
For a while, including Su's parents, deacon and others, everyone's eyes looked at Su Mo changed, disappointed, disdainful, and despised.
On the altar, Sumo slowly got up, his fists clenched unconsciously.
After glancing around coldly, Su Mo sneered in his heart: “These people are really snobbish!”
In the past, Sumo was extremely talented, and everyone was polite to him. Wherever he went, he called and hugged, and his ass patted.
Now that he had awakened the trash martial soul, these people immediately changed their faces.
Sumo shook his head, did not care about them, walked down the altar and strode away.
His face was a little itchy, and there seemed to be a patch of grass around him.
“Didn't I die in a car accident? Why are you alive again?”
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he escaped from the dead, the scene in front of him made him immediately widen his eyes with excitement. Immediately I was dumbfounded!
Not enough! How can such a beautiful girl be convenient everywhere?
Xu Qiong's eyes widened.Just watched the beautiful girl completely fade her skirt in front of her eyes, and the panties inside were taken off little by little, and she was tender and white in her eyes, with a unique body fragrance of a woman. .
“Girl, what are you doing, you can't defecate anywhere!”
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, put down her skirt in a panic, and the whole person bounced from the place in a panic, actually stepping on a sharp sword and flying away in the air.
Damn, what is this? Royal sword flying to the sky?
So, is it really a fucking fairy?
Xu Xuan was taken aback for a moment, and at the same time, a large number of strange but familiar memories suddenly gushed out of his head, as if he had been born to experience it.
I fucking crossed!
Immediately reading the memories that did not belong to him in his mind, Xu Qiu sorted out everything.
This turned out to be a world of cultivating immortals. Just like the little fairy who was so angry that her sword flew into the sky in front of her, people can practice various exercises to become immortals.
And the owner of his body is actually today's consort, but this consort is a complete badass.
He himself is just a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was recruited by the emperor as a consort by chance, and provided him with countless treasures of heaven, material and earth for cultivation. In just six years, he condensed the abdominal pill and entered the golden pill period.
On the day he entered the golden pill period, he really entered the cave room with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights on the wedding bed. As a result, the beautiful and flirtatious princess was like a fox, and his whole body was repaired to make up for it, and even the spiritual root talent was taken away.
The genius consort Ma Ye had just been newly married and became a waste person. He had no longer the slightest use value. He was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner. On the way to the frontier, he was slapped to death by the person arranged by the emperor. He died of anger, and finally was dumped here.
“Oh, it's a pity!”
After sorting out these memories, Xu Qiong looked regretful, shook his head and sighed, and said in annoyance: "Damn it! Why didn't you take a step earlier and travel to the happy time when Princess Mei Yan was frantically exercising in bed?”
Thinking of the glamorous princess's ecstasy on the wedding bed, her proud figure, and the breath of all kinds of customs, Xu Xuan felt more and more regretful that she was one step late!
“A bold thief, dare to peep into this girl's toilet, and give me my life!"”
At this moment, a soft reprimand suddenly came, and it was the fairy who went and returned.
Her face was flushed with shame and anger, but there was endless killing intent in her eyes, and she was still stepping on the cold and sharp sword under her feet, and she killed Xu Qiu.
"Damn it, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! Obviously you squatted on the place where I was lying, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please put your pants up first, okay? You look like this, so I have no motivation to run away!"Xu Xuan yelled, and ran away.
The woman's face suddenly changed, her face flushed, she raised the blasphemous pants under her skirt, gave a bah, and angrily scolded: “The adulterous thief is looking for death.”The speed of the sword flying under his feet suddenly accelerated, and he whizzed towards Xu Qiong.
While running wildly, Xu Xuan frantically thought of a way to escape.
Suddenly, a flash of light flashed in his mind.
Immediately, he stopped, stretched out his hand and took out a familiar token from his arms, turned around and shouted at the woman: "Bold witch, I am the consort of the Fire Yuan Kingdom today, do you dare to disrespect me? Be careful, I will punish you nine tribes!”
At this moment, a series of system tones suddenly sounded in Xu Xuan's head.
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for activating the pretend face-punching system. This system will escort you and help you pretend to be forced to help you fly!”
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for successfully pretending to be forced. The reward for pretending to be forced is worth 1 point. Do you enter the mall to redeem it?”
“The system has detected that the host's 'Xu Qi' ability is low and weak, making it difficult to survive under the difficulty of this world. A gift package for novices is specially rewarded. Do you check the gift package?”
At the same time as the tone sounded, a light curtain window popped up in front of him, showing several pieces of information and data.
Xu Qiong took a deep breath first, and then laughed uncontrollably. What kind of pretending face-punching system is this? It's a system tailored for me to help me break through the sky! Now you have to play.
“Lewd thief, death is coming, what's so funny about you?”
Suddenly, a soft reprimand pulled Xu Xuan back from the ecstasy.
The woman had already stood more than ten meters in front of him at some point, holding a flying sword in her hand and pointing at him, but her big watery eyes stared at him vigilantly and suspiciously.
“Come, come... you want to do it with me, don't you? Do you have the guts to try to get one step closer to me?”
“Ding, congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for successfully pretending to be coerced, and the reward for pretending to be coerced is worth 1 point.”
Sure enough, the system tone in Xu Xuan's ear that only he could hear sounded again, and he couldn't help laughing again. “By the way, there seems to be a gift package.”
Suddenly, the picture of the light curtain window in front of him changed, and a square gift box appeared. The gift box was opened, and several streamers of light jumped out and flashed away.
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for obtaining the initial experience pill, and you can get 10,000 experience points by taking it.”
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for obtaining two primary Shenxing Escape talisman, which can be instantly moved to any place within a radius of five kilometers after use.”
"Congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for obtaining the first-level "Taikoo Five Elements Jue" (Note: The first-level chapter can only be cultivated to the foundation-building period, and can be redeemed in the mall in the future).”
“Ding, it is detected that the host's'xuqian’ spiritual roots are incomplete and do not meet the cultivation conditions. The system will complete all spiritual roots for you.”
Immediately, Xu Xuan felt as if an electric current was running through his body, and his scalp became numb instantly.
But what followed was a sense of comfort, the pores all over the body seemed to be completely opened, greedily absorbing the aura from all directions.
Boom!
Soon, he felt that his body had undergone earth-shaking changes, and he became closer to nature, as if he could integrate into all things and control all things.
But he knew very well how familiar this feeling was. When the Tianhuo spiritual root was not taken away by the princess, he had such a cordial feeling for the flame. Now the system not only repairs his Tianhuo spiritual root, but also completes the spiritual roots of other attributes.
Jinmu, water, fire and earth, all five spiritual roots were all together at once, and each of them was the best “heaven” level.
I'm going, this is going against the sky!
Thinking of this, Xu Xuan finally couldn't help shaking his arms and shouting: “The system is in hand, I have it in the world, what kind of shit, the princess and Emperor of the Yuanguo, when I return from Xu Xuan's upgrade, I will step on you all and smash you to pieces.”
“Bold adulterous thief, since he claims to be the consort of Huoyuan Kingdom, how dare he speak out and try to kill the king?"”The woman next to her is a bit silly. Is this consort crazy?
“Ding, congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for successfully pretending to be forced, and he got 1 point for pretending to be forced.”
Only then did Xu Xuan relax, and the corners of his mouth twitched slightly. Damn, Gu Yan was forced to look to the future, almost forgetting the current trouble, and he had to quickly find a way to run away.
“By the way, Experience Dan!”
He suddenly remembered that there was also a beginner experience pill in the novice spree.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly used the IDE operating system interface to open a package, and three items appeared in it.
“Use, use."Xu Xuan stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
“Ding, congratulations to the host'xu Qiong’ for the success of cultivating the "Taikoo Five Elements Jue".”
"Ding, the host'xu Qiong’ took the initial experience pill and gained 10,000 experience points.”
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qi' for upgrading, the first level of the current realm qi refining period.”
“Congratulations to the host'xu Qi' for upgrading, the current realm is in the third tier of qi refining.”
“Congratulations to the host for the upgrade of'xu Qi‘, the tenth level of the current realm gas refining period.”
In just a few breaths, Xu Xuan changed from a mortal with no power to bind a chicken to a cultivator of immortals, and sprinted directly to the tenth floor of the qi refining period, just one step away from the foundation-building period.
Moreover, his current strength is infinitely stronger than the tenth layer of the normal Qi refining period.
The reason is that he has five heavenly spiritual roots, which is equivalent to a person possessing five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the attributes of these five different reiki, the power that erupts is far more than five times as simple.
“I really have nothing to say this time. Who is invincible if I am not invincible?”
Xu Xuan couldn't stop getting excited in his heart. But at this moment, the woman on the opposite side waved a stream of light across the sky, and the sharp-edged sword blade rushed over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn it, fairy, I just asked you, a little beauty, to come forward and take a good look at this consort. Who let you draw the sword? You are a sneak attack!”
Seeing the flying sword coming, Xu Xuan was taken aback, and immediately opened his mouth to scold.
But the scolding returned to the scolding, but the movement under his feet was not vague at all. As he slid back, the tips of his fingers condensed a ray of water energy aura and gently bounced on the oncoming sword blade.
“When!”
There was a trembling and crisp sound, and the sharp sword was bounced out by him.
“This...how is it possible?”
The woman was stunned for a moment. Those in the sect who can crack this sword so lightly, except for those uncles who are inscrutable in cultivation, at least those brothers and sisters on the sixth floor of the foundation stage can do it!
“I just wondered. I said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding. You are still entangled, and you still want to kill me? Don't think that if you look like a fairy, I won't hit you. Anyway, I didn't see it clearly just now. This time I will look at it fairly.”
Xu Xuan scolded angrily, stepping out with Yu step under his feet, the earth element aura suddenly merged into the earth, the speed suddenly doubled, and he appeared in front of the woman in the blink of an eye.
Immediately afterwards, a ray of water element aura gushed out of the palm of her hand, surrounding all directions, and the woman was imprisoned on the spot before she could react.
“Lewd...lewd thief, what do you want to do?”The woman was shocked, feeling that the fire energy aura in her body was completely suppressed.
“Hehe! Since you call me a thief? Then I can't carry this pot in vain.”
Xu Xuan smiled meanly, raised his eyebrows, and stretched out his hand directly to the woman's skirt.
Chapter One If there is an afterlife, dance with the world!
The nine heavens, the sea of clouds, the wind and thunder platform, the first line of heaven!
Here is the Nine Heavens Land, three days up, a Jedi, Fengleitai! You can pick up the wind and thunder, and you can go in and out for a day!
But at this moment, on the stage of Fenglei, it was a fishy fog!
“Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! Spare you from death!”
“Chu Yang, the number one artifact in the world, such as the Nine Tribulations Sword, is in your hands. It is a waste. For many years, you have made no progress. It is simply a tyrannical thing! Let's hand it over.
Bursts of noisy screams came from all directions.
The look in his eyes is still as calm and steady as a rock! －The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, it is full of meaning that he would rather fold than bend! Even though he has been fatally injured!
At his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, countless mutilated limbs were severed, and blood was dripping.
Looking at the group of masters who were just shouting all around, but did not rush over, Chu Yang's face showed a sneering smile, arrogant and disdainful!
Such a person, such a mind, no matter how high the cultivation level is, no matter how many people there are; even if he can kill me 10,000 times, he is not worthy of being an enemy of me!
How could the matter of the Nine Tribulations Sword in his own hands be leaked out? I obviously checked for three years before and after to determine that there was a blade of the Ninth Tribulation Sword in the last three days of wind and thunder. After a lot of hard work, I finally found the opportunity to risk nine deaths and one life to come to the last three days, but why did I come here, but encountered such a powerful ambush?
Today, I entered the last three days, and it was only the fifth day!Today's game is purely a dead end! I have always been known for my secretive whereabouts. Who knows my plan?
I rushed more than a dozen times in a row, and every time, I was blocked back!And these places you choose are all dead ends!
Extremely affectionate, extremely sword-like! I destroyed my love into the sword, used Kendo to enter the martial arts, used martial arts to seek the way of heaven, at the cost of lifelong loneliness, and used killing everywhere as a treasure raft for the world. It's a pity that after all, I still can't practice the Nine Tribulations Sword and the nine Heavenly powers!
Did you choose the wrong one? Or is this path simply wrong?
Ruthless swordsman, ruthless swordsman, if a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? Kendo, martial arts, Heaven, after all, are ruthless... But now, at the moment of life and death, why is it so shaken?
Nine Tribulations Sword, Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Looking around greedily staring at the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You only know that if you get these Nine Tribulations swords, you will be invincible in the world, but do you know how much I have paid for these Nine Tribulations Swords?
There is nothing left.
The blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was passing quickly. He had pursued martial arts all his life, entering love, breaking love, and then ruthlessly destroying love. At the moment of death, he thought his only regret should be that he had not reached the highest level of his pursuit of life in his lifetime, but what he didn't expect was that at this moment, there was a figure in his mind that he thought he had already forgotten.
Mo Qingwu, Chu Yang's woman in love and broken love!
“It turns out that I don't really have a broken relationship...” Chu Yang muttered to himself with a self-deprecating smile at the corner of his mouth.
A trace of remorse quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, sweeping his entire heart in an instant.
Light dance! It is unknown that I may meet you when I go to Huangquan this time?
“Let's go together! Simply chopped him up! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, it's not too late for us to discuss it slowly!"One person shouted loudly: “If not, wait for him to reply, it will be our turn to go to great lengths!""Everyone around him suddenly promised, and suddenly they raised their swords and surrounded Chu Yang.
“If you don't dance lightly in your life, you will be bitter for a lifetime; if you dance for the king in this life, you will be bitter for a lifetime!”
This is a small poem written by Mo Qingwu on the night of love. I still remember that Mo Qingwu had tears in her eyes at that time, her eyes were sad and resentful. She... had known that she was using her love to practice, but she still threw herself into her arms like a moth to a fire, letting herself burn as much as she could!
After hearing the news, he rushed there immediately, but after all, he was one step late. Although he later killed all the members of the family that hurt Mo Qingwu and killed all the chickens and dogs of the nine races, the beauty could not be resurrected after all!
That peerless beauty, when she was dying, lay softly in her arms and said to herself: “Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife...if I can still meet you, I hope you can...take a good look at me." I look better than a sword!”
Light dance, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can there be tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two clear tears, but smashed his heart to pieces at that moment!From then on, this heart is dusty!
Life and death follow to Jiuxiao!
This is a poem specially made by Xueyuanhan, the world's No. 1 talent, who felt Mo Qingwu's affection for Chu Yang.
And now, Qingwu, you have arrived at Jiuxiao, but I am still in the world... But I will be able to live and die with you immediately... for the rest of my life!
Chu Yang thought in a daze, with a gentle and sad smile on the corners of his mouth that had always been cold and hard.
Light dance, wait for me!
Light dance, you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice any kendo, rather not have any pinnacle, rather not take revenge, but also be with you! In this world, what can be worthy of your satisfied smile?
no! Not bitter... Light dance, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter, now...I am very bitter!
More and more swords were added to the body, blood flew out little by little, and the pain focused a little bit from all over the body, finally interrupting the song and dance in my mind!
Chu Yang screamed wildly! Suddenly stood up, his long black hair flying fiercely!
Chu Yang's heart ached, and he looked down, and the piece of jade pendant hanging on his neck shattered in front of his eyes with a snap.In an instant, Jaime was about to crack!
This is the only memorial that Qingwu has left to herself!
“Kill!"Chu Yang suddenly raised his head, murderous intent surged frantically in his eyes, and he shouted wildly. The Nine Tribulations sword in his hand suddenly swung ten thousand sword lights, just like the Nine heavens lightning suddenly connected into a girdle of light!"
There was a bang, and all the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, looking in horror at the neat circle of half-cut weapons under Chu Yang's feet, cold sweat streaming down from his vest. Unexpectedly, the power of a blow from the Nine Tribulations Sword turned out to be terrifying!
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, “Do you want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"”
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and said slowly: "Okay! I'll show you the Nine Tribulations Sword!”
He suddenly jumped up! He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, but he jumped up!
“The Sword of Nine Tribulations, a little cold light is shining!”
As the arc shot out, thousands of cold rays rushed out!
Nine Heavens Swordsmanship! A sword!
Nine Heavens is the name of this continent.All swordsmanship in history has never dared to use these three words to name it, but this Nine Tribulations swordsmanship directly uses the name "Nine Heavens"!
Through the ages, this is the only set!
Although Chu Yang could not exert the true power of the Nine Tribulations Swordsmanship, he had understood these swords for a long time. The power of these swords, although not as great as imagined, is far beyond worldly swordsmanship.
Dozens of masters around, knowing that this sword is very small, all showed the ability to press the bottom of the box, and tried their best to resist this attack! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapon in their hands, and they were almost unsteady.
“Nine Tribulations Sword, why not slaughter the world!”
The first move is not over, the second move has already come murderously! The rushing light is like the rising tide of the sea, and the boundless murderous intent is overwhelming!
Screams sounded, and more than a dozen masters who were enough to dominate the party tried their best to resist at the same time, but they were still splattered with blood and retreated in embarrassment!
At this moment, everyone has an illusion: Chu Yang is definitely not injured now! It's definitely in a complete state!
They didn't know that they interrupted Chu Yang's memories and Mo Qingwu's song and dance, making Chu Yang completely furious and completely realizing all the potential of his body! This is the power of life, the wrath of the soul!
“Nine Tribulations Sword, when you gather together, you will be the emperor!”
Chu Yang Huoran opened his eyes and roared in a low voice, "Why? Why is there no?”
In the distance, in three directions, three kinds of light rose at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! Panic was dazzling, with an unparalleled frenzy.
I am just a martial artist, and although I am only one level away from the king level, this level is tantamount to the difference between heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a lot of money!
“But these past three days, it's not a place where you can go wild as a poisonous sword warrior!""One person said softly: “It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly, I'm very sorry!"”
Following the words, the other two appeared together. The three of them were all in wide robes with big sleeves, their clothes fluttering, and they came from the wind. The posture is chic and the face is calm.
Chu Yang's eyes were already a little blurred: “You three kings... also want the Nine Tribulations Sword?”
“I want you to die!”The three of them smiled at the same time, as if they were: "But by the way, taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword is also a windfall." Great harvest!”
Chu Yang smiled coldly, straightened his back, and said proudly: "It's a pity that you don't understand the Nine Tribulations Sword! You will never get it!”His eyes became decisive and absolute!
He is no longer able to fight anymore!
This is the only sword he can exert full power. When he saw the sword technique, he knew that this sword could be used by himself. But such a sword needs to be urged with one's own life!
It is the spirit of the Nine Tribulations Sword that kills on its own and destroys everything!
The three kings almost didn't even have time to parry, and they couldn't even scream out, so they disappeared! Even the golden shadows transformed by their king-level power are still flashing in the air, but their lives have been classified as nothingness!
Chu Yang sighed, and he was in the air, his eyes flickered casually, but he found a character who he thought should never appear here. In the distance, a man in white looked at this side blankly, his face full of disbelief.
“Secret?"Chu Yang's eyes kept looking, and he finally understood.Why was he so secretive in his actions that he was ambushed, and why were all his attacks blocked by others!
It turned out to be him, and the gods and ghosts were inexplicable. No wonder I was so defeated!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air and slowly fell down, like a dead leaf falling in late autumn, falling into the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, he murmured: "Light dance, if there is an afterlife, dance with you all over the world!”
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest enthusiasm and the strongest longing! Because there, there is my own lover!
Chapter Two
Meng Qi's secret joy was interrupted, and his pride turned to shame, while Zhende and other little monks looked at him in surprise and contempt. It was quite a sign that primary school students wanted to draw a line with bad classmates. Only Zhenhui “Fang Aqi” stared blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, as if wandering outside the sky.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head and looked at Xuanzang next to him. Could he see any clues?
For him, shame and frustration are trivial matters, and it is a big problem to expose the fact that he has been reincarnated from the dead!
Xuanzang was still full of bitterness and depression in his eyes. After feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he shook his head gently: “Namo Amitabha, everything is subject to the decision of Junior Brother Xuanzang.”He didn't hint, he just said it.
Uh, he thought I thought he was begging him for mercy... Meng Qi breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, knowing that he had passed this level, unless the parents who abandoned the body, Uncle Ma Face, etc. found it, otherwise it shouldn't be seen through. If it takes another ten years and eight years, no one will doubt it, and the memories of childhood are easy to forget.
Compared to this, entering the handyman's yard is just a trivial matter!
Meng Qi, who was crooked and upright, tried to make his expression as sluggish as Zhenhui, so as not to be seen through by Xuanzang that he was actually not so depressed and sad.
After the wide-faced and big-eared Xuanku asked the remaining children one by one, together with Mengqi and Zhenhui, a total of six people entered the handyman's house, and the rest belonged to the monk's house.
The preceptor of his right hand gently tapped his left palm: “Follow me to the temple to shave and receive Buddhist scriptures and other things. I will work hard in the future. I have never had the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma houses to practice profound Buddhist scriptures and martial arts.”
Is there Dharma here too?
Meng Qi was taken aback for a moment, but Xuan Kuo didn't give him time to think, so he walked straight through the children and walked outside the hall.
There were strangers all around, and Meng Qi didn't dare to ask more. He followed the two yellow-clothed monks Xuanku and Xuanzang and turned into a nearby courtyard.
“You are not officially getting started, you just need to have worshipped the Buddha and shave your head to keep your name."Xuan Kuo pointed to the futon road in the Little Buddha Hall.
“Yes, Uncle Xuanku.”The children all responded with true virtue, and then knelt on the futon one by one, prostrating to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshipped the Buddha, Xuan Kuo folded his hands together, and Bao Xiang solemnly saluted the Buddha statue, chanting “Namo Amitabha". Then, he walked up to a child and stroked his right hand on top of his head.
The child's long black hair changed immediately, turning yellow at a speed that Meng Qi could see with the naked eye, and falling to the ground like fallen leaves. In less than two breaths, the child became a real little monk.
“The troubles are over, and the red dust is far away."Xuan Ku said solemnly, his mellow voice echoing in the clean Buddhist hall.
“What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!”
Meng Qi was shocked and excited. Will he have the opportunity to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuanku walked up to the children one by one, removed their hair, and always said the same words in his mouth.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, meditated on the name of the Buddha and Taoist ancestor, and mourned the hair that was about to say goodbye to him.
The thick and wide palm of his hand stroked Meng Qi's head, and withered hair fell in front of his eyes. This made him sad and almost unable to restrain himself. He loved the red dust so much that he never thought of becoming a monk. Monk.
“The troubles are over, and the red dust is far away.”
Xuanku's voice was like a chime bell that rang suddenly, shaking Meng Qi's whole body and clearing his mind.
But after Xuanku left and Chengjing disappeared, Meng Qi's belief remained firm, and he must return to the vulgar in the future!
After worshiping the Buddha, shaving, and keeping a monk's plate, Xuan Kuo asked a few gray-clothed monks to take the children to the backyard to get their own things-two sets of gray robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, "Shaolin Commandments", "Twelve Small Curses for Early Class" and so on.
“When you have learned the words in the ‘Lecture Academy’, you can recite the precepts of the temple and the small curses of the morning class. Before that, I will talk about the main precepts of the temple in general. First, you must not deceive the teacher and destroy the ancestor. Second, you must not allow it. You must not steal martial arts. Third, you must not kill, fourth, you must not drink alcohol, fifth, you must not eat meat, sixth, you must not break the color precepts...” Xuanku repeated the main precepts that need to be observed several times, and at the end he said solemnly: “Those who violate it, scold lightly, and abolish martial arts if they are heavy." , Expelled from the temple.”
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and the rest were punishments for hard work, copying scriptures, rod punishment, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the “sundries Courtyard” with these little monks.
“In this temple, those in gray robes are ordinary monks, those in yellow robes are deacon monks of each monastery, and those in yellow robes and red cassocks are the abbot, the head of each monastery, and the elders...” Along the way, Xuanku did not relax. The little monks instilled “common sense in the temple”, until Zhende and others entered the “martial monastery”, he became silent again.
The group of people walked farther and farther away. Inside and outside the yellow wall, there were green trees, and it was rare to see the temple of Buddha. After a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled and old courtyard.
“Oh, Brother Xuanku, Brother Xuanzang, are you here so early?”A fat monk at the door greeted him with a smile, also dressed in yellow, but his collar was slanted open and his stomach was shyly.
Xuan Ku frowned and folded his hands meticulously: “Namo Amitabha, Brother Xuan Xin, how can you be so lazy?”
The fat monk Xuan Xin had long been familiar with Xuan Kuo's temper, and he was not angry at all: "Oh, you are too obsessed with the foreign minister. Is this a disciple of our handyman academy?"”He didn't want to entangle Xuanku on this issue, and pointed directly at Meng Qi and others.
“Please also arrange for Brother Xuanxin."Xuan Kuo replied solemnly.
At this moment, Xuanzang, who had been making a saw-mouthed gourd, suddenly said, "Zhenying, is Zhenguan still in the handyman's courtyard?"”
“Still there, still there!"The fat Monk Xuanxin said suspiciously: "Brother Xuanzang, what do you ask them to do?" Is it intentional to accept them as disciples?”
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed: “My martial arts is ruined, and it is inconvenient to mistake my children. How dare you accept apprentices? Brother Xuanxin, please let them be in the same room with Zhenying and Zhenguan.”
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhenhui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently. This was the first time Xuanzang had arranged his own affairs. Could it be that the two monks, Zhenying and Zhenguan, had something special and could help themselves?
“Haha, Brother Xuanzang, what you ordered, brother, how dare I say ‘trouble’? Why do these little things need to be like this?"Xuan Xin agreed in one bite.
Xuanzang glanced sideways at Xuanzang, and didn't say much. Instead, he said to Meng Qi, Zhenhui and other little monks: “I arranged you in the handyman's courtyard because you have your own problems. If you can understand yourself and polish your mind, you may not have the opportunity to enter the martial monastery, the Dharma monastery, and even the Bodhi Monastery in the future.”
“But if you continue to cheat and cheat, be lazy and greedy, impetuous, and suffer unbearable, I will not hide it, and I will report it to the commandment court and punish you accordingly.”
He made no secret of his thoughts, to show that he was magnanimous and not selfish, and the old face of Xuanxin next to him blushed slightly.
“Yes, Uncle Xuanku."Meng Qi and the other little monks replied in unison.
After watching Xuanku and Xuanzang leave, Xuanxin twisted his lower body, causing pieces of fat to shake up and down: “I'm finally gone, I'm most afraid of seeing this iron-faced ghost.”
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to squint, and followed Xuanxin, who was walking and swaying, into the Zen room.
“Zhenying, Zhenguan, this is your junior brother's true determination, true wisdom."Xuan Xin pointed to Meng Qi and Zhenhui, then turned around and took the other little monks to another zen room.
In the zen room, there is a shop that can accommodate seven or eight people to fall asleep, and there is nothing else.
Above the general shop, two gray-clothed monks lay down and sat down. They were all in their twenties. The lying person had a dull expression and was speechless. The sitting person had deep eyebrows and a cold tone: "Just put the package and luggage at the bottom of the shop. If you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the courtyard to get it.” "I don't know what brother is called?"”
Meng Qi glanced at the true wisdom of Mu Mu Nene, and decided to establish a good “roommate relationship” by himself.
The sitting person said coldly: "True view.”
After answering, he stopped talking, and even turned his head not to look at Meng Qi and Zhenhui, making the topic of Meng Qi's belly closer to the relationship impossible to play.
As for Zhenying, he closed his eyes and continued to fall asleep.
Who are these people!
Meng Qi secretly slandered him in his belly, but on the surface he smiled and said to Zhenhui: “Brother Zhenhui, I am really determined, you can call me brother in the future.”
“Yes, brother."Zhenhui cried without embarrassment at all.
It's better to be this dumbfounded little guy!
Meng Qi sighed secretly, and decided to play the role of the elder brother and help Zhenhui well: “Little brother, eh, I'll call you little brother, come on, let's change the monk's clothes first.”
Although there were people in the house, Meng Qi, who used to cool off shirtless in the dormitory when he was in college, was not uncomfortable. He quickly took off his clothes and changed into monk clothes.
While quietly thanking the monk for the simplicity of wearing the clothes, he did not show up obediently, while checking the things on his body that he had not had time to examine before.
The robe of this body is finely woven and has a soft texture. Even if Meng Qi doesn't know the goods, he can see that it is of great value. At the same time, “He” has a transparent jade pendant hanging from his waist, and he wears a small jade buddha pendant tied with a red rope around his neck. , Close to the chest, it is cool and uncomfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized Jade Buddha, and saw that “it“ was full of compassion and lifelike. Obviously, the carving was extraordinary. At the same time, ”It" felt delicate, both warm and cool.
“According to Uncle Ma Face, what kind of nameless old monk gave this Jade Buddha to?" But since what Hou Ye didn't take it away, it is estimated that it is not an ordinary product, so it is better to wear it close to your body.”
Meng Qi re-hung the Jade Buddha pendant on his chest, hid it close to his body, then packed up the jade pendant, clothes, etc., and put it under the bunk he selected.
At this moment, Zhenying, who had been sleeping, suddenly turned over and sat up, quickly put on his shoes and went out. Meng Qi was taken aback and didn't understand what happened.
“It's dinner time."Zhenguan said coldly, and also got out of the shop and walked outside the door.
Who are these two people!
Meng Qi scolded secretly again, then turned to Zhenhui and said, "Little brother, are you ready? It's dinner time!”
“All right!"As soon as Zhenhui's voice fell, the little figure rushed to the door like a rabbit, as if she was already hungry.
“..." Meng Qi was suddenly embarrassed. Is it only himself who is more normal here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door, looked back at Meng Qi, her face full of doubts: “Brother, won't you go?”
You have a conscience and know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought secretly, and then replied half-jokingly: “I'm not as hungry as you.”
Seeing you one or two, it's like being reincarnated by a starved ghost! \Q>
He turned around and ran away.
hello! After shaking a few times, he shouted loudly: "Eh, little brother, wait for me!”
Suddenly, a burst of sadness hit his heart. The other person's is the younger sister. Why do I only have the younger brother, and there will be no younger sister in the foreseeable future.
Under the heavy rain, a beautiful-looking woman aged twenty-seven or eight, with a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxury villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling and she comes from a remote mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to university with dreams and hopes, but she didn't expect to meet a man who changed everything for her. This man is the famous flower young man in Beitang City... Li Zhe!
At that time!Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in the same school. In an accident, she was taken fancy by Li Zhe. Then Li Zhe launched a crazy pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost with all kinds of tricks and unscrupulous means.
And Zhao Meiling is just a simple and simple girl who has just come to the city. That would be the opponent of such a master of love. Not only the body, but also the heart were completely handed over to him, but then Li Zhe got tired of her and abandoned her fiercely.
Later, Zhao Meiling learned that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the child, so she didn't hesitate to fall out with the family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling originally wanted to raise him as an adult by herself, but five years later, because of her overworked body, she was terminally ill. There are no more years to live. She finally decided to send the child to Li's house. I want the child to feel the love of the father and have a better life, so she can rest assured after death.
But this was rejected indifferently by the Li family, and they did not admit that the child was their Li family at all. Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with the child, begging bitterly.
At this moment, the iron gate slowly opened, and several people walked out holding umbrellas. The man in the lead was somewhat similar to the little boy. He was Li Zhe, the father of the little boy.
“Here! Smelly woman, this sum of money is enough for you to live a good life.” Li Zhe frowned and stretched out her hand to hand Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must stay with Fu'er, he is your son!”
Li Zhe refused, and then said coldly, “Do you want this money or not?"”
Hearing this, Zhao Meiling was already in tears and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and then was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, who was kneeling on the ground, hugged Li Zhe's thigh at once, and begged bitterly, “Zhe!”
“Pop!”
Before Zhao Meiling finished speaking, Li Zhe slapped her heavily on the face, “Let go! You stinky woman”.
When the little boy next to him saw his mother being beaten, he hurriedly ran over and hugged Li Zhe's thigh, shouting childishly, "Dad! Don't hit mom”.
In fact, since the little boy was born, he didn't know who his father was, and his mother never said it again. It wasn't until this time Zhao Meiling took out Li Zhe's picture and showed it to the little boy that the little boy knew that he had a father. At that time, he was so happy that he almost jumped up.
But now, he doesn't understand why his father doesn't want his mother and beats his mother.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy holding his thigh with a look of disgust, and kicked the little boy out, “Who is your father, dead~wild~ kind!"”
The little boy was kicked out and fell to the ground, curled up, covering his stomach with a painful face. The pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear, and he couldn't help but roll big tears out of his eyes. Tears flowed out of his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, and quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked nervously, "Fu'er, are you okay?"”
The little boy looked at his mother's worried look, pursed his mouth, fought back tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and son. He walked into the iron gate. Next to him, a man with gray hair who looked like a housekeeper picked up the check, handed it to Zhao Meiling, and said sympathetically, “You'd better accept it!"”
Zhao Meiling shook her head, hugged the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain curtain.
The housekeeper looked at the back of the mother and son, sighed deeply, turned and walked into the house, and slowly closed the iron door.
Four years later! Before Zhao Meiling died, she called the nine-year-old boy who had grown up a lot to the bedside, gently rubbed his head, smiled weakly and said, “Fu'er, you have to study well in the future, and you will have a good job in the future. Don't resent the Li family, and don't resent your father. Promise me, okay?”
The little boy fought back tears and nodded seriously.
Seeing the little boy nodded earnestly and agreed, Zhao Meiling had a peaceful smile on her face, and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shone on the earth, making it not dark around.
“Boom!”
Suddenly there was a deafening noise in the sky. Zhao Fu was taken aback and looked up at the sky. He saw that the whole sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of fire, countless colorful rays of light, dragging a long tail, something like a meteor fell from the sky.
"Boom!”
With a loud noise, a meteor emitting colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu. The dazzling light made Zhao Fu block it with his hands. Then the strong light dissipated, and a spar with one finger long and two fingers thick floated quietly in the air two meters high from the ground.
Zhao Fu stepped forward curiously and held the spar. The spar floating in mid-air was grasped by Zhao Fuyi unresponsively.
At this time, the people who were asleep were also awakened by a series of loud noises, opened the door or opened the window, looked at the countless spars floating in the air, and began to rush out of the house frantically, snatching the spar, Zhao Fu didn't stay much in place, and hurriedly returned to his home.
In a single-room rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the spar. If it is sold alone, no gemstone can match this spar. If the quantity is rare, it is priceless. It is not a cinch, but the number of people falling from the sky is too large, let alone tens of billions, so this spar may not be worth it at all.
“Detect that the host is a primary intelligent body, and start soul binding”".
Ding! The soul was successfully bound and began to travel to the world of Apocalypse.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes darkened and he fainted on the ground."Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, unfortunately died for bravely saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. After research and decision by the relevant departments, Hong Dali was posthumously named a hero and an outstanding college student in the province.”
“If you don't go, if you don't go, I don't want to go to the Hong family with you to make a kiss!""Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow and kicked her white and tender calf desperately: “Hong Dali is a famous waste in the city. He has lost all the faces of their Hong family, and they are sick and crooked, and they are still a standard scumbag if they don't have a good brain. I don't want to find such a person as my fiance!"”
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Ruisi, chairman of Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is versatile and knowledgeable. She is also a beautiful woman and a fair lady. She combines the aura of heaven and earth. In particular, she cooks a good dish. The standard can go up to the hall and down to the kitchen and up to the big bed. I don't know how many boys have dream lovers in school.
But today, I heard from my father that he was going to take him to Hong Dali's house, which is famous for being a loser. How could she stand it? “If it weren't for his parents to spoil her, a lone seedling in a thousand acres of land, just a waste like him, would have been driven out of the Hong family to fend for himself. How could there be a chance to be a loser all day long?”
After listening to her daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, who was sitting at the head of the bed, showed a wry smile on her face, and said helplessly: “Xinxin, I can't help it either.”
Your marriage with Hong Dali was personally decided by your grandfather back then. Although he was a bit of a loser, it's not a big problem, is it?
Tang Ruisi was wearing a cyan-gray vest with a spotless white undershirt inside, a simple bow tie at the collar, a touch of stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, short black hair combed back meticulously, shiny and shiny, the whole person looks quite good, but the original bright eyes are now full of helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really cornered, how could he be willing to give away his own daughter?After all, that Hong Dali can be called a wonderful work in the world. The only thing he likes to do or can do is two words: loser.
His most famous sentence is: “I have to be a loser. Don't undefeated people waste my parents' talents to make money?"”
This sentence can be called a joke that no one knows in the entire city of Tianjing. Many parents who educate their children will say this: "If you dare to learn from Hong Dali, the black sheep, see if I don't break your leg!"”
Therefore, it is indeed reasonable for Tang Muxin to have such a big reaction.
“This is also..." Tang Ruisi frowned and thought for a while, then suddenly his eyes lit up, and said, "Xinxin, what do you think of this?" Let's make a kiss first, and when Dad's company returns to normal, then we will find an excuse to withdraw the kiss.This time our research funding exceeded the budget. Once the funding keeps up, as long as the research on this project is successful, it will definitely be a sensational event in the world. When we calm down, we will find a way to retire at that time. His family shouldn't say anything, right?”
Tang Muxin whimpered: “It's easy to get married and it's hard to retire. His family is one of the top 500 companies in the world. How can it be so easy?”
I have to say that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, her fate will never be much better by then. This is the world, the law of the jungle. No one may dare to touch you when you are strong, but when you really fall in your family, there will definitely be no fewer people who come to fall into the ground.
For example, the young master of the Liu family who has been entangled with her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way than this method, so she could only get up unwillingly: "Then, then go and try it first, oh, dad, in the future, you must remember to retire, I don't want to marry that black sheep!”
“Well, okay, for the sake of my family Xinxin, Dad must try his best to deal with it. Tang Ruisi sighed and patted Tang Muxin on the shoulder: "Xinxin, let's go."”
Hong Dali sat on the bed, his eyes blank, his mind in a mess.
The surrounding environment is very strange, and there is a considerable problem with the memory in his mind. Now he can barely recall the harsh braking sound, and the rest is a mess of memories that don't belong to him at all. .
“Am I dead, here, where is it?""Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself: “This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live." So, where is this place?”
He looked around for a while, then thought for a while: “It is imperative to figure out the current situation first.”
“First, am I dead or alive now? 2. Where is this place and who is my identity. Three, what should I do next.”
“So now let's look at the first point,“ Hong vigorously squeezed a small piece of oily skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and it hurt: "I feel pain, so I should be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and top of his head again: “This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the scope of human beings."”
“Then the next step is the second question, where is this place and who is my identity."Hong Dali looked around again, reinforced concrete house structure, snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room: “It's modern society. That's right, but I haven't seen the stars on the surrounding walls, and I've never heard of all kinds of toy models. In this way, this world should be the legendary parallel space?”
There was no one around, Hong Dali stood up carefully and took a deep breath: “This body is really weak, like a thin bamboo pole, I really don't know if it will suddenly die suddenly.”
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali opened a few Web addresses casually, and the content displayed was very different from that on earth, but at least he understood a few things: “First, the characters of this world or this country are still Chinese characters. Second, it is indeed a parallel space. Many things are different from the earth, but they are not much different.
Don't have an ID card?”After thinking about it, he was quickly relieved: "Hehe, it seems that the age of this body should not be very high, it is about seventeen or eighteen years old. The ID card may be available, but it is more likely that it has not been issued yet. After all, this world is different from the earth, and some subtle differences are normal.”
“The system of the defeated family was successfully bound, and the current level is: Level 1.”
When the system sound was introduced here, a villain suddenly appeared in Hong Dali's mind, which seemed to be himself.
"Host name: Hong Dali.”
Sexual ability: 32. Note: The index of normal people is 100.”
Hong Dali looked stunned: “The defeated system?Is this thing true or false?
Fortunately, there is no other way. Hong Dali was eager to commit suicide, and the metal sound of the system came again: “Description: For every 100,000 yuan (RMB) lost by the host, you can get an attribute point.
When all the attributes of the host reach the normal human level, the defeated system will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added at that time. Please look forward to it.”
“Can you get attribute points?”At this time, there is really nothing better than being able to improve one's own attributes. Hong Dali smiled when he heard this. “Can you really get attribute points through the losers and make yourself like a normal person?"”
Although the voice of the system is still so cold, it is almost like a singing song in my ears at this time: "Yes.”
Hong Dali almost didn't jump up with excitement: “I want to squander it! I want to be a loser!”
“Next, ask the host to take on the first task: the first loser. Task requirements: At least 100,000 yuan will be lost before midnight today.
“The current amount of losers: 0.”
"Damn it, it's already eight o'clock in the evening! There are only four hours left, no, I'm going out! I want to be a loser!”
Just thinking of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali, and said softly: “Master Dali, Master and madam let you go, please follow me.”
“Can you buy me a game cabin?"Jiang Fei asked his father expectantly.
“Xiaofei, you are in high school now, and you can't indulge in games like you used to!"”
“Mom! This game is different! This is a masterpiece that Shengshi Company has carefully produced for thirteen years, and it is known as the second world of mankind!”
The game called "Dawn" mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in human history. It is not only a model of virtual reality games, with a degree of fidelity close to 100%, but also through a brand new technology that allows players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physiologically, but mentally it can experience a completely different magical life for 24 hours!
“This game is being promoted by all countries! It's not a lie. This game will not only not affect learning, but also give people a better rest!”
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
“I said for the last time, no way! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework within 20 seconds, then your pocket money will be cut by 50% next month!"Dad said with a stern face.
“Old stubborn!”
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that there was no need to talk about it. The conditions in his home were good. His father was definitely not reluctant to buy this game cabin, but his father's brain was rigid, and he absolutely didn't believe that playing games would not affect learning! “Phineas, how's it going?"Dawn" is about to officially open tonight. Are you ready for the game cabin?”
As soon as the bell rang after class, after the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei grabbed him by the shoulder and asked.
Forget it, I can't play with you this time!"Jiang Fei gave a wry smile!
Brothers are all pointing at you!”
Zhao Feng, the little fat man, said anxiously. This little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in school. Jiang Fei's high school class 19 is the key class of the school, but Jiang Fei's grades are medium, his grades are not good, sports are not good, and he is not very good at interpersonal communication, so he can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
“My father disagrees, what can I do?"Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, he didn't say anything to his only friend.
“Why don't the brothers chip in to buy you one?"Zhao Feng said, because Jiang Fei's conditions are similar, they are all the kind of guys who are not outstanding in all aspects, so the relationship between these two transparent people who are not noticed by teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
“I hope so!”
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has liked to play games since he was a child, especially this kind of realistic game. As a boy, who doesn't want to fight a swordsman? A big man should wear a three-foot sword and make immortal achievements. This is every man's dream. It's just that in the age of peace, it is a society with highly developed science and technology. Let alone there is no war, even if there is war, you can press the button, so if you want to enjoy the blood of fighting, you can only go to the virtual game to experience it!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless. Since he entered high school, Jiang Fei has been issued an entertainment restriction order by his father. All the gaming equipment at home is sealed, and online games are even more free to talk about!
After school was over, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly. Although it was only around six o'clock in the evening, it was extremely dark because it was already winter.
Thinking that today is the day when "Dawn" opens, Jiang Fei angrily locked himself in his room!At about ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also completed his homework. He lay on his back on his bed and watched the wall clock on the wall approach ten o'clock a little bit, feeling a little uncomfortable.
The opening time of "Dawn" is 10 o'clock this evening, and then it runs for eight hours a day from 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning the next day. It will not delay the normal life of the player, but also allow the player to fully experience the 24-hour game time! "Hey! Such a great game actually doesn't have my share!”
Jiang Fei muttered, while subconsciously rubbing the ring on his index finger with his hand.
“What the hell is this?”
The boss with Jiang Fei's mouth open, looking at the faint ring in his hand, was a little speechless with fright!
"Humph!”
A white light flashed, and Jiang Fei's eyes flashed. When his vision returned to clarity again, he was no longer in his own room!
“Ding! Welcome to the world of Dawn! Novice assistant No. 34784 is at your service!”
A crisp female voice came into Jiang Fei's ears!
“"Dawn"? Is this the login interface of "Dawn"?”
“To be precise, this is the character creation interface!"The novice assistant replied.
Jiang Fei is still a little unimaginable. He doesn't have a game cabin at all. How could he enter the game?
Maybe this is my dream! It may be that I was too tired from finishing my homework, so I fell asleep on the bed. I am afraid that the mysterious ring just now is part of a dream. I have thoughts day by day and dreams at night. Maybe I want to play this game too much!Chapter One
“Liar! Big liar!”
An angry Jiao drank, and then there was the sound of the soles of his feet stepping on the bluestone ground to escape.
Zhang Hang stretched out his hands helplessly: “I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher in the college... I just want you to be my student! Moreover, even if I am a liar, why should I add a 'big’?”
After muttering, thinking of what the director of Political Education had said, Zhang Hang rubbed his eyebrows: “The seventeenth one! If I can't even recruit a student today, I can pack up and go home tomorrow!”
Zhang Hang was not a person from this world, but the administrator of an ordinary university library on earth. He only remembered the raging fire, and then... there was no more, and he woke up to this world again.
Similar to what is described in the novel, martial arts is respected and strength is king!
I thought I could go through a wasteland, but I was tragically divorced, and then I fought back and sang all the way... It seems that I thought too much. When I got here, I found out that it was not a student, but...a teacher!
The most miserable teacher in the entire college!
Other people's classes are overcrowded and crowded, and they can't sit down, and his class, there is no one. He finally pulled in a few, and in the end he even cursed “liar” several times, turned around and fled!
The reason is that the guy who is pierced by his own soul is the least powerful among the teachers, and he has a very poor vision. He can't see anything. The key... is to teach wrong. There has been an example of going crazy!
This is the same as the dead in the hospital. Their reputation is greatly damaged and they are spurned. Even the new students are kept away one by one, for fear of falling into his hands and being taught half to death!
There were no students and they were criticized again. In last year's teacher evaluation, the entire college ranked first, and even got the only zero score in history.
Depressed, he borrowed alcohol to drown his sorrows, but hung up as he wished, and took the opportunity to cross over by himself.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum. If he can no longer recruit a student in his class this year, he will be directly expelled from the teacher qualification!
Today, seventeen new students have passed by his classroom. As a result, when they heard their names, they all ran away without exception, like a little girl who met a strange maize and ran as fast as she could.
“It seems that you have to find a way to fool one!”
I was thinking about how to open my mouth to pull people, and I saw a girl with a cute face showing her head from the door.
“Excuse me, is this Teacher Lu Xun's class?”
The voice is sweet, cute, and the appearance is beautiful and lovely.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the college, the classroom is full every time, and countless people come here.
“Just her!"Seeing someone caught in the net, Zhang Hang's eyes lit up.
I recalled the various pretending routines I had seen in my previous life, sat quietly in my seat, and posed as an expert in the world: “Do you want to worship him as a teacher?"”
The girl nodded again and again like a sparrow, and her jet-black eyes were full of admiration: “I heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian College. The students who teach are all of extraordinary strength. Everyone is proud to join his class!”
“No matter how well he speaks, it is inconsistent with your cultivation theory. Not only will he not make progress, but he will retreat if he doesn't get it right! The teacher's reputation is not obvious, and he can make rapid progress in line with your theory, and his cultivation base is greatly increased!”
“That's it... I also heard my brother say something similar!"The girl was taken aback for a moment, her beautiful eyes were a little confused: "However, I don't know what kind of class I am suitable for!"”
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Hang's eyes lit up, and he hesitated for a while. Sages such as Marx and Encos appeared in his mind one after another, pretending to be embarrassed: “Meeting is fate, so let's do it. I am also a teacher in this college. I can help you see your roots, talents, and temperament for free. By the way, I can recommend a suitable teacher for you!”Then excuse me, sir!"”
Unexpectedly, the teacher I met casually was so righteous, and the girl nodded excitedly.
“You first show me the cultivation base for me to see!”
Zhang Hang's eyes were half open and half closed, as if he didn't care.
“Yes!”
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
After a moment of effort, the fist wind roared in the room, and the energy was scurrying around the girl like a dragon. The whole popularity breathed, condensed but not dissipated, and the prestige was not obvious, which meant that she had an excellent foundation.
“Well, I can see it. You usually practice seriously and hard, have a solid foundation, and have excellent talents. You are a rare genius!"After a set of punches, Zhang Hang nodded in satisfaction.
He learned this from fortune tellers on earth. The words are all golden oil, and the range is very wide. People can't hear the mistakes, but they secretly call for accuracy.
“Teacher, I have suffered an injury to my leg. The doctor said that it is basically useless...” The girl interrupted him, with some doubts in her eyes.
“Injured..." Zhang Hang's old face flushed, but his face was thick-skinned and no one else could see it. He continued to incite Hu Kan: “Do you think I didn't see it?" I knew it when you used your power just now! The reason for saying that is because... it is not broken!”
Anyway, it's all fooling around. If you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense. First fool a disciple over and talk about it.
“Chance? Teacher, what kind of opportunity is it?”The girl's eyes lit up.
After she injured her leg, she always felt inferior to others and secretly had low self-esteem. She didn't expect that it might be a blessing in disguise.
“This opportunity can make you soar into the sky and become the number one freshman. After all, your talent is very good, and you are a peerless genius that has never been seen before, but...” Zhang Hang said again and again, and he almost didn't take out a “Tathagata Palm”.
Hearing that she could be the number one freshman and boasting that she was a genius, the girl couldn't help showing enthusiasm on her face, and quickly asked, "But what?”
“But..." Zhang Hang sighed, sighing that a good talent was about to be buried: “There are not many teachers in the entire college who can see this kind of opportunity!"
“No students are accepted?"The girl originally held great hope, but her eyes dimmed slightly when she heard this, and then she figured out something and jumped up abruptly: "They don't accept students, then the teacher...do you accept it?"”
“Of course I still accept it, but, as you can see, I am indifferent to fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!”
Puff!
Before she finished speaking, the girl fell to the ground: “I know Mr. Gao Jie, please accept me as an apprentice! I will definitely practice well and not lose the teacher's face!”
“The students promise not to disturb the teacher until they have to!"Seeing that he was a little reluctant, the girl nodded quickly, with a sincere expression on her face.
“I don't have many students. I may not be as resourceful as other teachers, and I will be criticized...” Zhang Hang continued.
“Well...I heard that refining resources is very important..." The girl hesitated.
Teachers receive resources in the college, which are linked to the grades and quantity of students taught, and many other conditions. If the resources are not enough, it will be difficult to make progress in cultivation.
“Ahem, I said that on purpose to test you. Since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I will reluctantly accept you! Seeing her hesitating, Zhang Hang immediately interrupted and hurriedly said, "Verify your identity!"”
“This...so fast?”
Unexpectedly, the teacher changed her face like turning a book. It was ridiculously fast. The girl was slightly stunned. She took the token that Zhang Hang handed over to represent her identity. She was considering whether to verify it or not. She saw that Teacher Zhang, who had been extremely calm before, had already pulled her palm and took out a sharp knife. With a gentle stroke, a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Humph!
The light flickered.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't the teacher just say that he had to think about it, indifferent to fame and fortune? Why are you moving so fast, and... the knives are ready?
“From now on, you are my student!"Dripping blood to recognize the lord, Zhang Hang breathed a sigh of relief, and returned to the appearance of a master again: “What's your name?"”
“Tell the teacher, my name is Wang Ying!”
Knowing that it could not be changed, the girl said no more and nodded with a cute expression on her face.
“Well, take your ID card, go get your bedding and books, and find your own place to live by the way!" Class will start tomorrow, just come here to find me!”
Zhang Hang waved his hand.
“Yes! Wang Ying nodded, turned and left.
“Successfully fooled the last one!”
Seeing her become her own student, Zhang Hang breathed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It's not easy. If it weren't for a lot of pretending skills on the Internet, I'm afraid it would be really difficult to succeed today.
With a student, you can avoid the doom of being expelled. Under Zhang Hang's relaxed mood, he suddenly felt that the whole person's spirit was a lot smoother in an instant, and the obsession that hovered in his mind was slowly disappearing. .
“Don't worry, since I have become you, I will live well for you!”
The previous Zhang Hang died because he couldn't recruit students. He was unwilling. At this moment, there were students, and his last persistence disappeared without a trace. Until this moment, Zhang Hang could be regarded as a complete master of this body.
Boom!
Taking complete control of his body, Zhang Hang was thinking about fooling a few more students next, when he felt a shock in his mind, and the voice of Huang Zhongdalu suddenly sounded.
Boom!
All kinds of mysterious languages shocked him a little dizzy, and then a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five large characters shining brightly.
Tiandao Library!
Pushing the door and walking in, countless bookshelves lined up, all kinds of books were endless, and there was no end in sight.
“Library? Nima, I was a librarian in my previous life, and I won't be in this world, it's still the same!”
Other people's spree, either grandpa or the system, all kinds of awesome good things, but he is a library, Zhang Hang only felt that his eyes were dark, and he almost didn't pass out.
library?Dry bird? Could it be that in future fights, others throw swords and I throw books?
“What kind of books are you looking at?”
Helpless in his heart, Zhang Hang stretched out his hand and grabbed the books on the bookshelf, trying to see what the library did, but when he grabbed it, he found that his palm passed directly through the bookshelf and was empty.
“Are you playing with me? Give it to a library, but you can't get any books, and you can't read them. What are you going to do?”
Zhang Hang's face was speechless, crying without tears.
Chapter 1
Hey? Where's my tattoo!
Zhao Yu lifted her sleeves and looked at her two white and tender arms in surprise. Before, he had two domineering green dragons with open teeth and claws tattooed on his arms!
Why...is it all gone?
Zhao Yu raised his head and found that he was sitting in an office with dazzling lights, with small partitions for office use on the front, back and left.
At this moment, the phone has been ringing non-stop, paper documents are flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office staff are quickly shuttling in the hall, all of them looking overwhelmed.
At this moment, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket walked quickly and greeted everyone, “Team leader Qu Ping will now tell you the case of the electric stick rape case. We are going to take action tonight. Everyone, listen carefully!”
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was full of words and several photos posted on it.
Hearing the greeting, many staff members hurriedly gathered around, pulled a chair casually, and sat in front of the whiteboard to listen carefully.
Zhao Yu did not move, still sitting in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in a great shock. He touched his right ear, which was actually intact! Previously, his right ear was split in half by a punk during a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to see her face, but suddenly saw the photo on her desk. There is a handsome young man in a police uniform in the photo, who looks exactly like himself!
Grandma bear! In shock, strange memories flooded into his mind in an instant like the flooding of the Yellow River. Only then did Zhao Yu gradually realize, could it be... that he had encountered the legendary crossing!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a gold medal thug of the Qinglong Gang, a ruffian king who was fighting for his life! Although his real name is also Zhao Yu, people in the rivers and lakes prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma bear!
Zhao Yu was shocked again, and he finally remembered that before that, he had been executed by drug injection!
But, thinking about it... why did you come here?
Could it be... I really crossed! ？
And it's still seamless, so it's useless to reincarnate at all?
As new memories poured in, he was surprised to find that this was a parallel world similar to the previous one, and his current identity was an agent of the mobile team of the crime squad, and he was actually a policeman!
The hall where he is now is not elsewhere, it is the office of the police station!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes, this huge contrast was really unimaginable. A senior little ruffian turned into a major crime squad agent. This... where does this make sense?
He touched his head subconsciously. In the past, he had been cut off several times on his head and his hair was always uneven, so he simply left a big bald head, like a fierce god. But now he actually has elegant black hair, and he looks like a handsome young student.
“Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of rape with electric sticks in our city...” At this moment, a female agent with short hair and big eyes is telling everyone about the case.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information of this agent from her memory. She is the leader of Group B of the major crime squad. She is not young, but she has a steady style and a high case-solving rate. She is a celebrity in front of the leader. Generally, she will preside over any major cases that require the cooperation of the whole team.
“The victims were all beautifully dressed young women, and they all had bad lifestyle problems."Team Leader Qu Ping introduced, “The locations of the incidents are mostly near weathered places such as bars and cabarets, and the crime time is also after midnight."”
“According to the victim's confession, the perpetrator first followed the victim into an unmanned roadway, then used an electric stick to stun him, and then raped him. After committing the crime, the offender will still pee on the victim!”
Hearing the word "sprinkle*pee”, the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu glanced at it. This person was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the mobile team of the crime Squad. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person sent Zhao Yu to many tribes, and asked him to deliver letters and pour tea every day, just like he ordered his subordinates.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a ruffian king, but a big boy with a weak personality who has just finished his internship and turned into a full-time police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many colleagues with old qualifications will make fun of him and arrange for him some jobs that should not belong to him.
Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon anymore, how can he stand being yelled at? He patted the table and stood up.
His sudden standing up startled Liu Changhu, and even Team leader Qu Ping had to pause.
Who knows, just as everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly rushed in front of Zhao Yu.I saw a girl with a ponytail, a slightly fat body, and big glasses appeared in front of everyone.
The girl is a newly assigned trainee clerk from the crime squad, and her name is Li Beini.This girl is a nymphomaniac, and she has only been in contact with Zhao Yu for less than a month.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied, he looks like a talent, with a head of 1.78 meters, Yushu Linfeng, young and handsome, and really has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being yelled at, Li Beini hurriedly stepped forward to relieve her: "Captain Liu, I'll do it, I'll do it! I am still in the internship period, and I will naturally do these tasks!”
After speaking, Li Beini smiled knowingly at Zhao Yu and ran to the pantry in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu didn't have a good attack either, so he could only sit down again patiently and continue to ponder his crossing problem. Although he passed through, his memory was very clear, because he was still lying on the execution recliner just a few minutes ago. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed and did not kill anyone at all! The person who was killed was the owner of a real estate group. Zhao Yu only beat him up according to the instructions of his superiors, and it was impossible to die.
Besides, even if it is really beaten to death, it is manslaughter and should not be convicted of murder! Therefore, his death sentence is the conspiracy of others!
Thinking of this, Zhao Yu couldn't help being full of anger, his fists clenched and clenched. If you can find the person who framed you in the future, you must double their repayment!
At this time, Li Beini had already brewed the coffee and distributed a cup to each of the colleagues present. The little girl's face has always been filled with enthusiasm. Every time she gives out a cup, she will kindly encourage words such as “Hard work” and “come on”, which are quite popular with colleagues.
“Officer Zhao, there are two packs of sugar in this cup! I'm destined to get through tonight, but you have to hold on!”
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to react, Li Beini happily put the plate away.
At this time, team leader Qu Ping had already finished speaking about the case, and Captain Jin Zhenbang, the number one of the crime squad, spoke instead. Captain Jin is over 50 years old and has white sideburns. He is an old man who is unsmiling and takes things extremely seriously.
Captain Jin said loudly, “There have been three electric stick cases, and another one will be characterized as a serial incident. Not only the top, we can't wear this big hat either!
Therefore, everyone cheer up and strive to solve this case in the shortest possible time! “In this way...Group A sent someone to the crime scene to investigate. Since the perpetrator was following the victim to commit the murder, then he will definitely have appeared in the bar and cabaret where the victim was before, and all the surveillance there will be transferred out. We must find this person!
“Yes!”
“Group B, you are mainly responsible for evidence comparison!"Captain Jin ordered, “The offender has no record, and the blood line is impassable." However, the urine of the suspect is an important clue. Although the police station can't find a match, you can go to the hospital or the physical examination center to check and compare. As long as this person has had a physical examination or been hospitalized, he will definitely be able to find him!”
“Yes!”
“In addition, the electric stick used by the perpetrator, the mobile phone signal that appeared at the scene, and the only victim who had seen the appearance of the perpetrator, these clues cannot be ignored, and they must all be followed up by someone!”
“Yes!”
“Well, each group will arrange an action plan. If there is no problem, let's set off as soon as possible!"Captain Jin said, closed his folder, and turned to leave as he looked at it.
“Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!”
Everyone looked back and found that the speaker was not someone else, but Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also taken aback, and hurriedly asked, "What's the matter, Zhao Yu? What's your problem?”
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said confidently, “I'm not feeling well. I'm going home first. Let's play by yourself!"”
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the office of the dean of the Senior Private Hospital in Donghai City.
With a ”pop", a thick case was slammed on the table. Dean Lin's face was livid and furious, “Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group. He owns a 40% stake in our hospital. You must give him priority to detoxification!”
Facing the dean's great anger, Han Yunxi put her hands in the pockets of her white coat, very calm. “Dean Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li is suffering from chronic snake venom. I am not allowed to cut in line here in non-emergency situations.”
She is pure and beautiful, with big eyes and a pair of small pear eyes. She has been known in the traditional Chinese medicine world for her amazing needle skills at a young age. She is a rare master of detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or human toxins, it is her strength.
“You figure it out, this is Ling Yun!"The dean was so angry that he shot the case.
“That's enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal in front of doctors, only men and women. Han Yunxi, let me tell you, arrange detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today on, get out of the medical profession!”
I thought Han Yunxi would be scared, but she was still calm and calm, with a serious attitude, “Dean Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, there are only two kinds of people, what I want to save and what I don't want to save, Mr. Li, I won't save, please be clever!”
After she finished speaking, she smiled politely, turned around and left. Her seemingly thin body was elegant and calm, and there was a kind of pride in her quiet beauty that could not be ignored.However, when Xuan Han Yunxi opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
“Han Yunxi, don't you dare to talk to me like that, stop for me!”
As she said, she casually smashed the case clip on the table at the back of her head. Han Yunxi was startled, only to feel a hot and humid feeling slowly flowing down from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Tianning.
Han Yunxi woke up in a daze from the sedan chair and heard the joy around her, the sound of blowing suo, knocking on gongs and drums one after another, and her eyes were dark.
What's going on?
Han Yunxi tore off the thing covering her head and took a look, and then took a breath. This... isn't this a hiker's handkerchief? Subconsciously raised his head and lowered his head again, and found that he was dressed in a phoenix crown, as if he was a bride who was getting married... drunk!
The sedan chair turned upside down, causing Han Yunxi to have a headache, and at this time, strange memories also poured into her mind. Undoubtedly, she has crossed, and she will get married as soon as she crosses!
The original owner was the daughter of the Han family of the Tianning medical family, also known as Han Yunxi. Because of her birth mother's medical skills, she was able to save the queen at the time, which is now the queen mother. She was accused of marrying to the then seventh prince, who is now Qin Wang Long Feiye. At that time, it was also passed down as a good story, and the Han family's status soared as a result.
But no one knew that Han Yunxi had killed her mother as soon as she was born, and she had grown into an ugly waste material girl who didn't understand medical skills. As a result, the marriage became a taboo for the King of Qin. However, the King of Qin annoyed the emperor a few days ago. The emperor gave an order to get married on another day before the end of the month.
King Long Feiye of Qin was crowned king as a young man. He was the only remaining prince in the battle for the throne. He was only in his early twenties at a young age. In terms of seniority, he is now the only uncle. He can be described as the first person in the Tianning Kingdom with a high position.
The palace of the King of Qin is in the south of the city, and the Han family is in the north of the city. The sedan chair has to pass through the city from north to south. The King of Qin got married. Even if he didn't show up, he still attracted thousands of people and caused a sensation in the whole city.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out these memory messages, joy stopped abruptly, only to hear Xi Po shout, “It's not good, it's not good, it's not good!"”
Chapter One
“Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's almost zero, get up and have some dumplings.”
Feng Yu felt that his voice was a little strange, but he felt very kind. He agreed in a daze, opened his eyes, but saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
“Sister?”
“Wake up, hurry up and wash your face. I told you not to drink, you have to drink, and you fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival Gala."Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is today New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu glanced around in confusion, a hut of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched bedding, an old wooden table, and a 20-watt incandescent lamp on top of his head, exuding a dim light. There are still old newspapers on the wall, which are all national events that he can't remember.
Isn't this the old house on the farm of his family when he was a child, but this house has long been demolished with the construction of a small town. How did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to realize that this was definitely not a tricky joke, because his hands became smaller and his arms became thinner.
He jumped out of the bed abruptly and stood by the door frame, with the mark he made with a knife every New Year's Day, the highest line, 1988, 166 cm.
Is it 1988 now? He hasn't graduated from junior high school yet?
He pinched himself so hard that he almost screamed out in pain. Isn't it a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out, and his mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lives in a hut, and when he goes out, there is the kitchen, and on the other side of the kitchen is the living room, which is called the hall house on the farm.
“I'm up, will you still drink in the future?"Zhang Muhua glanced at her son pitifully.
Feng Yu looked at his mother, who was still full of black hair, her eyes moistened.
“Mom, you have worked hard.”
“This kid, what are you talking about? Wash your face quickly, go to the house and watch TV for a while, and the dumplings will be ready soon."Zhang Muhua was very relieved when he heard that sentence. His son has grown up."
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. When he was just able to make money in the future, his father was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and passed away in less than three months, without even spending a penny of his earnings.
Feng Yu felt very uncomfortable for a long time because his son wanted to raise him but couldn't stay with him.
“Dad. Feng Xingtai turned to look at his son: “I'm up, are you still dizzy?" Let's watch TV, the national dance festival, it's a celebration.”
“Dad, I want to have a drink with you later. Seeing anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Just beer."”
I haven't drunk with my dad a few times in my life. Feng Yu now has a strong desire and wants to drink with his dad again.
“I haven't had a long memory yet, that's fine, I'll drink a little more later, I think you can get up tomorrow to celebrate the New Year!" Danying, go get two bottles of beer.”
Feng Danying shook her head helplessly and turned to get a beer and a glass.
There is also a single bed in the hall with bedding on it. Feng Danying went to school and lived in school. When she came back from vacation, she lived in the back room with her mother. Feng Xingtai slept in this bed. But three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
There is a three-door vertical wardrobe on the west wall of the living room, and there are two suitcases on the wardrobe. On a solid wood table, there is a 14-inch black and white TV with the Spring Festival Gala on it.
There is a folding round table in the middle of the living room, which is already full of dishes and chopsticks. There are a total of eight dishes, but all of them are leftovers from the evening.There are chickens, fish and elbows, all eight dishes are meat dishes, and none of them are vegetarian dishes.
Instead of watching TV, Feng Yu walked to the front of the closet and took a closer look in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can now be sure that he is reborn!
The mother quickly cooked the dumplings. Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help serve the dumplings. After all four of them sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up his chopsticks.
“Xiaoyu, you still drink!"Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
“Mom, for the New Year, let me drink a little more.”
Feng Xingtai also helped to say a few words, Zhang Muhua shook his head and let them go. Feng Yu also diligently poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister. As a family, he must have a drink.
“Dad, Mom, sister, happy New Year, cheers!”
Feng Yu took a bite of these leftovers on the table, and they all felt extremely delicious. In this year and a half, there has been no use of those hormone additives or anything. Fish, rabbits and the like are all wild, and chickens and pigs are raised by themselves.The two of them ate these dishes, just dumplings, and one drank a bottle of beer, no matter how much Feng Xingtai would not let them.
After eating, Feng Yu finished washing up and went back to his cabin to lie down.While lying on the bed, he tossed and turned, and couldn't help but think of his life before he was reborn.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his forties. After resigning from a securities company, he made his own investment life.
He had a wife and no children. His father died of illness in his early years, and his mother lived with him.
He remembered that it was the spring of 2015. In order to take his wife abroad to treat infertility, he wanted to make more money, so he put all his family's deposits, including the house and car mortgage, and borrowed a lot of money. All invested in the stock market, according to his prediction, this time is a bull market, fools can make money.
The situation was very good at first, and his investment soon doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company again, wanting to make more profits. If he doubled again, he would be able to do nothing in the next half of his life, and he would be able to have no worries about food and clothing.
When the stock market rose to 5,000 points, he, like many people, was greedy. He thought he could continue to rise. At first, the stock market did rise a bit, but the stock market quickly plunged because he used high leverage and did not have additional funds. Instead, he lost a lot of money. After paying back the borrowed money, he became destitute. His wife didn't know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he didn't know how to go home and face his family.
He went bankrupt. He drank a lot of alcohol that day, and then deliberately fell on the road under the gaze of many people and was hit by a large truck.
This shouldn't be considered suicide, right? The accident insurance he invested in should be able to pay millions, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembered that he looked at the big truck speeding by, thinking in his heart that if God could give him a chance to come back, he would not die so shamelessly, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But unexpectedly, God actually gave him a chance to do it again!
Since God asked him to come back, the regrets of his previous life will never be repeated in this life. He wants to become a rich man, he wants to become a legend in the investment world!
“Xiaoyu, stop yelling and go to bed quickly.”
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time, he complained about his husband and why he let his son drink again at night. This is nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly.Chapter One
Monday, May 20, 2019.
Spring and summer solstice.
This season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan region has changed greatly. During the day, he still wears pants to heat up into a dog; at night, he has to shrink in the bed and freeze into a cold bird.
Jiangnan University City.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, and the computer desk was pulled to the side of the bed to facilitate him to watch movies in various poses.
Song Shuhang didn't have a hobby of skipping class-the weather was sultry in the first half of last night, and he used a trick of "Ssangyong going to sea" to kick the quilt in his sleep.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply.Song Shuhang, who had only one pair of trousers all over his body, was suddenly forced. In his sleep, he fumbled on the bed with both hands, looking for it, but he couldn't touch the quilt. In the end, he only shrank into a shrimp-like skin, trembling under the authority of the midnight cold wind.
When the sun rose, Song Shuhang had become a member of the seasonal cold army.
The roommate has already asked for leave for him for today's class.
Then, he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The high fever faded, and the body was still a little weak, and it was impossible to go to class in this state. Therefore, he can only stay alone in the dormitory and watch movies bored.
On the screen, the progress bar of the movie slowly advances. But Song Shuhang didn't read the content of the movie at all.
“Hasn't the effect of the medicine passed yet? I'm so sleepy."He yawned, feeling a little heavy under his eyelids.
‘Didi Didi~' At this time, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer beats.
This is a prompt for someone to add him as a friend or join a group.
“Who will add me?"Song Shuhang murmured, he stretched out his hand and tapped on the lower right corner of the computer's touch screen, prompting a message to pop up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (*******) requests to add you as a friend. ]Additional message: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who is this strange nickname?
“Is it a classmate in the class?"Song Shuhang said secretly, and he couldn't help but think of the guys in the class who had obviously gone to college but were still in the fantasy period of youth. If it were them, they would indeed have such a strange nickname.
Thinking of this, he clicked ‘agree’.
Immediately afterwards, another system message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group‘Jiuzhou No. 1 Group’, do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to agree.
'shushan is under a lot of pressure’ and agreed to join the ‘Jiuzhou No. 1 Group’.
[You have agreed to join the group, so say hello to your friends! ]It also comes with a system smiley face.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang negotiated to close the prompts and group chat window-he is now drowsy, how can he have the energy to control what group he has added?
Anyway, his group setting has always been ‘No prompt message, only the number is displayed’. The chat in the group will not pop up to disturb him, and the number of chats will only be displayed after the group.
After he wakes up, he can go through the chat history and know what group he has joined, and the chat history of the members in the group will not be lost.
The progress bar of the movie is still moving forward tenaciously, but Song Shuhang's consciousness is getting more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 Group, after seeing a newcomer join, some diving members in the group appeared. Beihe Sanren: “Has Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Taoist friend in? It's been more than a year since you added a newcomer, right?”
Another ID quickly replied for "Su's Aqi’: "Are there any new Taoist friends? Which district of Huaxia are Taoist friends from?Where's the road number? How many products have you repaired?”
With this series of questions, I always feel that something is wrong?
“Is it a fairy? If yes, report your measurements and take a picture!”
“Brother Sanlang, are you really a goldfish?"Beihe Sanren sighed: “Don't die again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun adds another senior to come in?"”
Sanlang, this guy is good at everything, affectionate, righteous, and helpful, so he is very popular-that is, he usually likes to talk about flowers, and he is so good at it.
It's just that this guy's lucky value is so low that people can point fingers. Every time he doesn't accidentally die, he always offends the senior. These big seniors who are idle and miserable are worried about not having fun, and naturally they are very happy to toss the fun of Mad Knife Sanlang, which is delivered to the door.
“I beg you not to mention the words ‘Senior Senior’, this seat has a shadow in your heart."Mad Knife Sanlang sent a row of ’burst into tears' expressions.
Four years ago, his broken mouth offended a beautiful ‘big senior’ and was tossed badly... The big senior tossed him for a whole year and four months in a row. You heard me right, it's a whole year and four months!Thinking of those inhuman and eventful years, his eyes were wet.
As soon as Sanlangcai finished speaking, a series of grinning expressions popped up in the group one after another-unabashed, straightforward schadenfreude.
There were eight people in the group who showed their online status, and six of them popped up with a row of smiley faces.
“You gloating guys, this seat remembers each of you, don't let this seat meet you, otherwise you must let you taste the experience of this seat's seventy-two quick knives!"Mad Knife Sanlang said bitterly.He is very confident in his fast knife. None of the six guys who laughed badly just now are his opponents if they fight one-on-one.
Mad Knife Sanlang just finished speaking.
He has a deep cultivation base and has reached the realm of the 5-pin spirit queen, and he is only two steps away from the 6-pin spirit king, but he can't beat Aqi.
He has a seventy-two-way sword technique that is fast and ruthless, as well as a lightning-fast body technique, but he can't beat Aqi.
He is known as a mad knife, and he is even afraid of himself when he is crazy, but he just can't beat Aqi!
After the people in the group saw Sanlang wilted, there was another series of unscrupulous smiling faces.
“...” This time, Mad Knife Sanlang could only send a string of colons depressed.
The people in the group were noisy for a long time, but they didn't see the newcomer make a sound, and they were a little puzzled.
“The new Taoist friend is silent?"Beihe Sanren asked aloud.
It's a pity that because of the efficacy of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has once again entered a half-asleep state.
At this time, Su's Aqi happily sent a message again: “I read it, and the new Taoist friend called'shushan is under a lot of pressure’. Have you ever heard of a master called this number? Does this number sound a bit like a Confucian walker?
In retrospect, the Confucian walkers were even better than the Buddhists. Not only did their mouths experience harm, but their fists were also hard enough. And when you are in the mood, you will sing poems heroically to cheer up, which is great! I like to hit them the most.”
“Aqi, let me say, your expectation for new Taoist friends is always whether you are good or bad, and whether you are happy or not?"Madao Sanlang said with a tearful expression.
“Uh."Su Shiqi was a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren said with a grin: "Could it be another ‘big senior’ who can't use chat tools?"”
When he said this, everyone felt that this scene was very visual?
Yes, almost four years ago, it seemed that there was also a senior who left the customs after more than a hundred years of retreat. He also finally got on the chat software and was joined by Huangshan Zhenjun. But because he couldn't type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy named Madao Sanlang was very happy to spend his mouth in front of this senior, and asked this senior to report his measurements, and asked her to send photos, and voice chat or something.
Then...within a few days, Madao Sanlang saw this senior with his own eyes. That is a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Then, this beautiful senior tossed the three waves of the sword for a full year and four months before leaving contentedly.
At this time, an ID named ‘Pharmacist’ spoke.
The inexplicable short message has no end.
Fortunately, the people in the group have long been accustomed to the pharmacist's brief chat habit-he is asking the group leader where is Huangshan Zhenjun?
The shortness of the speech is not because the pharmacist is noble and arrogant, but because he uses two-finger zen and handwriting for typing, which is very slow. When the number of words is large, it is easy to make mistakes, and it is extremely painful to delete and write. Therefore, pharmacists are used to speaking short and short.
“After he added someone, he went offline immediately. I heard that the baby demon dog in his family had run away from home again, and Huangshan Zhenjun went after him again."Beihe Sanren replied.
“..." Pharmacist.
“Then we can only wait for the new Taoist friends to learn to use the chat tool before chatting.”
They are all preconceived, thinking that the new recruits are also fellow believers.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang woke up slightly.
“Remember someone added me to the group just now, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No. 1 Group?"He murmured in a low voice, casually clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the chat window of Jiuzhou No. 1 Group.
What group is it?
Soon, the chat history of an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably visited it again.
This seat? Hunting down the big demon dog?
Special vocabulary for various immortals.
The way people in the group chat and speak is also very interesting-half ancient, half white. The feeling is that modern people try to communicate in ancient languages, but they fail because of their ancient skills, which makes the communication method very awkward.
“Huh~~" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
It seems that this is a group built by Xianxia enthusiasts?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of Xianxia lovers!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a road number. The place where they lived should be called Dongfu, and the pet dogs lost by the group owner should be described as the big demon dogs in the family who ran away from home. There are also people who claim to have never fought a Confucian walker or something for hundreds of years, which means that the person claims to have lived for hundreds of years?
Just looking at these chat logs, there is a sense of shame.
“This level of obsession has reached the level of secondary two disease, and it is a very Chinese-style Xianxia Secondary Two. Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
It seems that this is a concentration camp for patients with the second disease of Xianxia Middle School!
This is his first impression of the "Jiuzhou No. 1 Group" and the members of the group.
But why did you add him to the group?
He looked at the information of Huangshan Zhenjun, the leader of the group, and he was not his classmate, and he definitely didn't know him.
The slender blue lines extend smoothly from under the nib. The light blue lines on the slap-sized card continued to increase, and gradually, a complex and mysterious pattern continued to become more perfect as the nib slid.
Suddenly the nib of the pen slammed heavily, changing the light spirit just now, followed by a sharp side hook, the pen hook is like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly dimmed and returned to normal.
After completing this card, his face was still focused as usual. He has only completed fifteen cards now, and there is still a difference of ten cards from today's task. What he is now making is a one-star energy card. As the lowest-level energy card, it is currently the most widely used and one of the most consumed cards.
At this moment, the room suddenly became dark.
The number one hundred is displayed on the meter. Unexpectedly, the energy ran out, so it seems that today's task will have to add another one. Chen Muxun, who returned to the table, devoted himself to work, relying on this most paper-level card for all his sources of life.
Chen Mu's room is very small, less than 40 square meters, with a semi-old work desk inside. In addition to the relatively clean work desk, there are mountains of debris piled up everywhere in the room. These sundries are also diverse, piles of old books, and various raw materials scattered.
In this humble place, Chen Mu lived for three years. This is a relief house specially provided by the federal government. For a small room like this, you only need to pay one hundred and fifty odis a month to stay. For poor people like Chen Mu, there is really no cheaper place than here.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally completed today's day's work-twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, and counted them twice in a row to make sure that there was no error in the number before he carefully put the energy card into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered the door, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted: “Amu is here!”
He replied to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper, Uncle Hua, is an old man of about fifty years old, and the years have left indescribable traces on him. There are fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card holder from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed it to the shopkeeper: “Twenty-five.”
Uncle Hua took the card in Chen Mu's hand, put it on the shelf without looking at it, and said with a smile: "Fortunately, you have Amu to send the card every day, or I will be short of supplies here.”
Chen Mu smiled slightly, but did not answer. He knew that Uncle Hua's words were probably meant as a joke. One-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards. What's more, it is located near Dongwei University. May only sell 25 energy cards in a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Mu's temper, and he didn't talk nonsense, and asked directly: "Does Amu need cash or transfer money?"”
Chen Mu replied simply, and after speaking, he handed a light green card that had already been prepared to Uncle Hua. After Chen Mu said goodbye to Uncle Hua after the settlement, he wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Mu: "Amu, wait a minute.”
Chen Mu stopped, turned around and looked at Uncle Hua in surprise: “Is there anything else? Uncle Hua.”
Uncle Hua took out a goose-yellow paper note from the drawer and looked at Chen Mu with a smile: “I almost forgot something. This is a certificate for the card maker's training class, which was attached by the dealer when the goods were purchased yesterday.”
Looking at Uncle Hua with a kind face, Chen Mu couldn't help being moved. He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years. If it weren't for him, Chen Mu believed that the current life would also be out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he just learned to make energy cards and sold them everywhere, but few people cared about it, and no merchants were willing to buy it. The amount required for a one-star energy card is very large, and merchants are more willing to purchase in large quantities at a time. And Chen Mu can only make up to 30 sheets a day. For merchants, this is just a small number that is not even a fraction.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy card, but the purchase price of each card was one hundred and three oudis, which was two oudis lower than the batch price of energy cards on the market. Nevertheless, Chen Mu was still very grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of one hundred and three Oudi was lower than the batch price of one hundred and five, Chen Mu felt that he was surrounded by great joy. I sold all the energy cards in my hand, bought the cheapest food, and bought all the ingredients for the energy card with the rest of the money.
Since then, Chen Mu's life has finally stabilized.
With twenty-five energy cards a day, he did not interrupt for a day.
After this, it was three years. In the past three years, he has only made one kind of card-a one-star energy card.In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time studying how to reduce costs.
Finally in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at ninety-five oudis. He could make a profit of eight oudis per energy card, and his daily income was stable at two hundred oudis. Three years ago, this was a figure he couldn't imagine at all. .
Chen Mu, who had recovered, smiled at Uncle Hua: "Thank you, Uncle Hua!"I took the class card and carefully put it in the card holder in my arms.
They are often advertised with extremely gorgeous advertisements. For example, this class certificate says “Dongwei University recognizes academic qualifications” and “Dongwei University senior senior card maker speaks with authority” Yunyun, in fact, Chen Mu knows exactly what is inside. . The only relationship between the institution that hosted this training course and Dongwei University is that this institution has to pay a fee to Dongwei University every time as the price for them to maintain this nominal “joint organization”.
Chen Mu still plans to listen to what is said in the training class.Card making is one of the most difficult subjects. For so many years, he has not given up self-study, but with little success. It wasn't until last year that he understood what was going on.
For a teenager who has no foundation at all, it is naturally even more difficult to teach himself card making, which is known for its difficulty and obscurity. However, he did not have the slightest doubt about his IQ. He could learn to make a one-star energy card within a week with only his memory. The card maker once praised his talent.
Since then, he has let go of this goal that was temporarily too high for him, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical learning. No matter how tired he is at work every day, he will take time out to learn these boring knowledge.
After bidding farewell to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along an alley. Today is Saturday, and he still has a job.
After walking through two streets for about twenty minutes, he came to a second-hand waste card acquisition station.
He is also the owner of this acquisition station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Mu would come here for three hours of short-term work.
Chen Mu nodded slightly to Xiaohei, but his face was still a little wooden.
Xiao Hei had already become accustomed to Chen Mu's face. When Chen Mu came here to ask for a short-term job, Xiaohei originally refused. Since his father started, this acquisition station has been taken care of by himself, and when it comes to him, he has also been taken care of by himself.
But when Chen Mu said that he didn't want wages, Xiaohei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu is still paid. Generally, Chen Mu will choose a few old cards to take away as his salary.
Sometimes Chen Mu would pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste piles, and Xiaohei calculated an account. Every month, he saved a lot of money on it. It's just that for the taciturn Chen Mu, he can't help but feel a little curious. How does this guy know that there is still remaining energy in these cards?
But since then, he has smiled every time he sees Chen Mu.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to sort the piles of waste cards. There are many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, quasi-object cards, and even some relatively rare plant cards and animal cards. But the cards here are all useless without exception, and all Chen Mu has to do is to classify these cards.
The work is going on very quickly, and it can be seen that he is very familiar with the work.
Chen Mu flipped his wrist and threw a card at Xiaohei: "Here, this card will last for a while.”There is at least half of the energy in this two-star energy card, and Chen Mu can't understand why the original owner of this card is so wasteful. The capacity of the two-star energy card is one thousand, that is to say, there is almost five hundred energy in it.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, his eyebrows opened with a smile. He ran to the energy meter head over heels and inserted the card in. When he saw the number “523” lit up on it, Xiao Hei laughed so much that his facial features were almost squeezed into a ball.
Three years of production career gave him his own understanding of the most ordinary and low-level cards. There is not only one way to make a one-star energy card. Chen Mu has already collected twelve one-star energy cards of different structures from this kind.
These one-star energy cards with different structures have given Chen Mu a lot of inspiration. It is precisely because he has borrowed some of the skills of these cards that he has successfully reduced the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five oudis. But such good luck does not happen every day. So far, he has only collected twelve.
But today's luck seems to be good.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, judging from the surface texture, he is a kind of one-star energy card that Chen Mu has never encountered another new structure.
He put this energy card aside and continued to dig through it. The number of one-star energy cards is too many, but Chen Mu took the trouble to check them one by one. His speed is extremely fast, almost as long as his hand is gently stroked from these one-star energy cards, he can know if he wants it.
All this comes from his familiarity with the one-star energy card. This familiarity was left over from three years of uninterrupted production. He didn't need to look at it. He could judge whether this card was a one-star energy card or a structure he had seen by hand. He is so familiar with them that every detail of them.
The fingers passing by the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was dizzy as if it weren't her own. The luxurious sheets touched by the palms of her hands were not the old ones she used to wash. The lamp on her head was not the half-broken energy-saving lamp style she was used to seeing. The pain on her body seemed to have just been torn by something. She raised her wrist, and the blue and purple marks on it were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to make herself scream, opened the quilt, and saw herself without an inch of hair inside, screaming almost out of her voice.
Lin Che's smart eyes dripped twice under his eyes, he decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed to clean up the messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out if he didn't turn his head back.
“Ah...let me go, you let go..." Lin Che struggled with both hands and feet.
The man's big hand pulled her neck, and without any effort, he dragged the person back to the bed.
His deep eyes seemed to carry an innate arrogance. On his frosty cheeks, his nose was high on his fair face, and his white jade-like skin made her, a woman who asked herself if her skin was good, feel envious and jealous.
She asked herself that she had seen a lot of men, but those men who were called male gods suddenly became overshadowed when they came to him.
Is this the man who spent half the night tossing her to death yesterday?
“Who sent you here, you actually drugged me? You did such a thing, thinking you could still leave here intact?"He looked at this stunned woman, anger flashed in his deep eyes.
This strange woman, with snowy skin, a pleasant face, big smart eyes, and fluttering eyelashes, like a frightened fawn, she was not to be outdone and stared at him with wide-open eyes.
Gu Jingze's gaze was fixed on her, and Lin Che's eyes turned quickly with her brain again.
However, she was fascinated by the wrong person.
Although the person in front of him is so handsome that people feel dizzy, he is obviously not the super-first-line star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was rudely grabbed by him again, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in embarrassment before she settled down again.
“You made a mistake, it's me who is severely damaged now.”Her butt hurts, her hands hurt, and the pain below is even more unbearable. When she was annoyed, she yelled out, "I'm fascinated by someone else. It has nothing to do with you. You think you are worth my medicine. My aunt didn't do it casually. You pay me back for the medicine!"”
Confused with the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tight, his eyebrows were twisted into Sichuan characters, and his dark eyes were like dormant beasts, staring at this woman in messy clothes. Half of her white shoulders were exposed, and the bruised and red marks on them were clear and dazzling. On the white and tender skin, it seemed that plum blossoms were blooming.
Those pictures of the night flashed in his mind again, his lower abdomen suddenly became hot, and he felt the obvious heat again, surging in his body.
Moved his gaze away from her face.
This damn woman dared to give him medicine, and the effect was still so strong.
His momentary surprise allowed Lin Che to finally get a chance. She jumped out of bed in spite of everything, and she pushed the man away forcefully.
She didn't dare to turn her head back, so she hurriedly ran out.
Hearing him hiss, she yelled, “What are you looking at, see for yourself!"”
“You..." Gu Jingze was about to turn around and grab her, but he felt his body unbearable for a while, and he was already unstoppable again.
“Damn it."He yelled and clenched his fists to suppress the damn**.
A series of voices came from outside.
Qin Hao looked back, his surprised mouth unable to close.
What was the situation just now?Why did a woman with ragged clothes run out of Mr.'s room?
He raised his sharp eyes, and his black eyes flashed with brilliance, causing Qin Hao to quickly swallow all the doubts he shouldn't have into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept washing his body in the bathroom, until the skin on his body was washed pink, before he cursed in the mirror, “..."”
Gu Jingze was taken aback. At this time, his mother came over, knowing that it would not be a good thing after thinking about it.
When the bathroom door opened, the lady with a beautiful face standing outside was looking at the mess of the bed in surprise.
Those beds that had not had time to clean up were clearly telling everyone in front of them what happened last night.
Gu Jingze's dark eyes were gloomy, and he pulled his bathrobe with one hand and put it on his honey-colored shoulders, “I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm very busy today.”
How could Mu Wanqing not ask? The excitement on her face could not be concealed. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, “Jingze, I already know that you have a relationship with a girl."”
Gu Jingze opened the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, “Will you leave this matter alone?"”
“How can I leave it alone, Jingze, you have to marry her, you have to take responsibility for other girls.”
“Mother, I won't marry her. I'm not crazy. She's just a strange woman. I don't even know her name.”
“Mother!"Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more troubled because he thought of that woman.
“Are you still thinking about that Mo Huiling? Let me tell you, it is impossible for you to be with her. You have been with her for so many years, and you still can't touch her. You are simply destined not to be together!"Mu Wanqing said unceremoniously.
“Mother, that's enough!"Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, “Jingze, you know your illness and you can't touch a woman at all. The family is almost ready for artificial conception to get you a child, but you touched a woman today, which means she is the most suitable person for you!”
The famous Taoist mountain Qingcheng, since ancient times, there have been countless strange people and strange people in and out of it. The so-called reckless hidden dragons and snakes are exactly like this.
Countless myths and legends, countless legends, like a thick cloud, cast a mysterious veil on Qingcheng.
At dawn, on the slate trail in the mountains, groups of Taoists in Tsing Yi, holding three long incense plants, marched quietly and quickly on the trail, running towards a stone wall towering into the clouds and smooth as a mirror in the back mountain.
The mountain road is steep and the dew is slippery, but these Taoists are almost faster than the horses, bringing up green shadows. Some people jumped up from time to time, Ling Feng flew across a distance of 100 meters, the morning breeze was blowing, and the clothes were flying, and the fluttering momentum was like a fairy coming to the world.
In the mountains of Qingcheng Mountain, the peaks, and the pavilions of the major palaces, there are Taoists who continue to walk out and gather in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there were a large group of small monks holding various flags and magic weapons, carrying incense burners and walking around the Nine palaces array. The cigarette rushed straight into the sky, and the dense air entangled it, turning into a cloud covering the top of the group of roads.
At the front of the many Taoists, just under the stone wall, a group of Taoists wearing Phnom Penh purple robes, with gossip pictures embroidered with silver thread on the back of their chests, and the edges of the robe sleeves have yunxia lines and Baicao patterns. The Taoists, who are gorgeous all over the body, are holding whisks in their hands, standing there expressionlessly.
The group of Taoists waited quietly for a while. When a red light in the east suddenly leaped up, and the misty red light instantly tore the world apart and sprinkled all over the place, many Taoists bowed down together and performed the three-kneel and nine-chant ceremony piously towards the stone wall. The ceremony.
Thousands of Taoists chanted mantras at the same time, and the sound of ‘buzzing’ mantras entangled together, turning into a subtle sound that made people tremble and spread far away. Gradually, a strange force rose from the sound of the spell, and a bright colorful glow shot out from the heads of many Taoists and shone on the smooth stone wall.
The Taoists wearing Phnom Penh purple robes bowed to the ground at the same time, muttering a prayer in their mouths.
After this lasted for half an hour, a ray of white light finally shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall released a clear white light.
The haze rose into the sky, and there were countless clouds and smoke entangled in the stone wall, and several hazy figures with golden light around them could be vaguely seen appearing in the clouds and smoke. The figures became clearer and clearer, and finally three men and two women, five Taoists wearing white robes with their faces obscured by golden light and unable to see clearly, appeared in front of everyone.
The woman in the middle lowered her head and glanced down at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall. Suddenly, a scroll was added to her hand and she threw it out casually.
There was a flash of white light on the stone wall, and the scroll woven of purple jade and gold silk slowly floated out, and it fell on the hands of the old Taoist in purple robe who led many Taoists to bow down at the front. The woman who threw out the scroll said a few words in a low voice, turned around and left with a few companions around her.
Several old Zipao Dao suddenly yelled: “The ancestor is merciful, merciful!”
The sound of ’Dong Dong' continued to ring, and all the Taoists kowtowed to the five men and women heavily, knocking their foreheads on the rocks.
The woman who threw out the scroll gave a cold cry, and suddenly all the Taoists knelt stiffly to the ground, no longer daring to make more movements.
It was the other female Dao beside the woman who smiled a few times in a low voice, and lost a few things with her backhand.
As soon as the light on the stone wall dimmed, the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several things shining with strange light slowly fell from the air, namely a sword, a bead, a small tripod, five talisman and nine medicine bottles.
Swords, beads, and small tripod are tiny in size, like children's playthings, but each piece is entangled in dazzling light and haze, and they are obviously extraordinary things.
The five talisman talisman is entangled in golden light and purple aura. Waves of pressure gush out of the talisman one after another, and the Taoists who are slightly closer are unsteady on their footing, and they are pushed back by this force one after another. Retreat.
The nine medicine bottles are densely engraved with various talisman and seals. The old Dao who had just taken the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists, and a quiet medicine box suddenly gushed out. Thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, and they felt that the seven senses were unobstructed, and the meridians all over the body seemed to have been washed with water, and the whole body was brightened.
Just smelling a wisp of medicinal fragrance is better than the three months of hard work of these Taoists. Lao Dao Zipao hurriedly stuffed the medicine bottle tightly and sealed it firmly.Just the aroma of the pill has such a magical effect, you can imagine what a treasure the pill in this medicine bottle is.
Several old Taoists in purple robes gathered together and muttered in a low voice for a while, then packed up the sword, bead, tripod, talisman and medicine bottle respectively, and then unfolded the scroll in front of all the Taoists.
The first half of the scroll is the "Taixuqi Sutra", a scripture for practicing qi and nourishing the soul.In the second half of the scroll, the faces of the old Taoists in purple robes were discolored, and they yelled in dismay. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists flocked out of Qingcheng Mountain.
Qingcheng Mountain's potential forces in the secular world were fully launched, setting off a huge invisible wave.
Chapter 1
In the scorching heat of July, Youbailu exuded a pungent smell of lacquer under the scorching sun, and it looked like it was about to melt.
The air above the road surface is directly distorted and skewed because of the transpiration.
Under such a poisonous sun, there are almost no pedestrians on the street, and there are even few cars traveling. Everyone is looking for a cool place to escape the summer, or to enjoy the blessings in an air-conditioned room.
A woman wearing a washed-out white shirt and gray suit pants walked hurriedly and ran straight towards the Second People's Hospital.
The hair stuck tightly to the woman's face because of sweat, and the woman's cheeks were abnormally flushed, which was obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet by the sweat on his body, and it felt uncomfortable to stick to his body, but Qiao Nan had no time to take care of this, and held on to the bag with 100,000 yuan.
This is the money she finally got by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needs 200,000 for surgery, and there are 100,000 more. I can only think of a way.
Walking straight towards the ward, Qiao Nan's hand touched the door guard, and she heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
“Mom, Qiao Nan caused it all. If it weren't for her, the army wouldn't divorce me.”This is the voice of Qiao Nan's sister Qiao Zijin.
“Don't cry, Mom has already taught Qiao Nan for you."Mother Ding Jiayi touched her eldest daughter's head distressed.
Qiao Nan, who was standing outside, was taken aback. It wasn't because her sister was caught by Chen Jun for cheating that Chen Jun would leave with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes were sad.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Zijin was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan bitterly, saying that Qiao Nan was hiding evil intentions and was an unscrupulous little beast who robbed her sister of her boyfriend and forced her to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had no choice but to quit and become Chen Jun and his sister.
“Mom, you divorced me, the child is not by my side, and I have this disease again. What should I do? Mom, I don't want to die. I haven't been filial to you. I really don't want to die.”
In the ward, Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi and cried badly. She was still so young and had a lot of good days. She really didn't want to die.
Ding Jiayi was moved to hear that her eldest daughter was so seriously ill and thought about filial piety to herself in the future.
Ding Jiayi coaxed Qiao Zijin to pat her on the back: "No, Mom won't let anything happen to you. Mom has already raised money for you because of Qiao Nan's dead girl.“
Not long after Qiao Zijin divorced Chen Jun, he suffered from kidney failure and had to change his kidney immediately.
But in this marriage relationship, Qiao Zijin made a mistake in cheating, and Chen Jun worked for the government again. Qiao Zijin was expelled from the house, and now he is sick. He doesn't even have the money to see a doctor and take medicine.
Qiao Nan, who had known her mother's eccentricity for a long time, couldn't help but feel pain in her numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She is already forty years old. After breaking up with Chen Jun that year, she has never been in a relationship again. It's not that she doesn't want to talk, but her mother won't let her talk.
Over the years, most of the money she made was given to her mother. Her mother used the money she made to buy a 150-square-meter suite for her sister, but she could only live in a rental house with only a few tens of square meters.
She pays for the food and even the utility bills at her parents' house. Every time her sister goes back to her mother's house, although she carries some things in her hand when she comes, she carries more when she goes back.
She is not married at her age, and she is laughed at as a leftover girl. No one wants it. It's not that Qiao Nan doesn't know that her mother won't let her get married, she just wants her salary.
But this is her own mother. Every time she falls in love on a blind date, her mother makes trouble to find a life, and she can't help it.
After all his hard work over the years, he only got the word “dead girl” in the end, especially Qiao Zijin. He also put all the responsibility for his cheating and divorce on himself. Qiao Nan grabbed the 100,000 yuan in his hand and suddenly didn't want to give it to Qiao Zijin. .
Before Qiao Nan left, the next conversation Qiao Nan heard was the one that really made Qiao Nan feel cold and desperate.
What if Qiao Nan raised 200,000 but couldn't find it?In fact, the doctor said that if a relative is willing to donate a kidney to me, the matching degree will be higher and rejection will not be easy.”
Leaning in Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Zijin said pitifully: "If there are really relatives... I don't know if I can save a little bit of money for seeing a doctor.”
**How can it be so easy to find, some people can't wait for such an opportunity until they die!
Knowing this well, Qiao Zijin knew that if she wanted to live, it was not enough to have money, and she had to think of other ways.
“Why don't Mom go for a blood test?"Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Zijin shook her head again and again. Her mother is at this age, and her kidney is definitely not much better than hers. Since she wants it all, she must want a good one: "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me. I can't bear you to use a knife, and my dad will definitely not be able to do it either.”
“Then..." Ding Jiayi thought for a while, her eyes lit up: "Wait a minute, the dead girl is here, I will let her go for a blood test, she is your sister, it must be suitable!"”
“Good is good, but will Qiao Nan not agree? After all, this is a kidney."Qiao Zijin's eyes were full of calculating light.
In order to survive, just in case, she would never let Qiao Nan have the possibility of rejection.
“Miss Qiao, come and see your sister, why don't you go in?"Qiao Zijin chatted with Ding Jiayi, and the nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Zijin's face changed drastically: "Mom..." She just had a conversation with her mother, and she was all listened to by {Qiao Nan, the dead girl?
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased out. Sure enough, she saw Qiao Nan's back, and then yelled Qiao Nan's name.
Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's shout and refused to look back or stop. Tears kept falling, but her heart was broken into pieces.
For her mother and her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister have calculated that her money is not enough, and now she still wants her kidney.
Ding Jiayi didn't understand Qiao Zijin's words, but Qiao Nan understood them. The more so, the more Qiao Nan hated it, even if she really owed the Qiao family, it should be enough!
Qiao Nan had a headache, so she wanted to tell her mother that it was dangerous on the street, and a car rushed towards her.
"Squeak”, "bang”, two loud noises blasted her ears, Qiao Nan was so painful that she couldn't speak, but she barely opened her eyes, wanting to see how her mother was.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened. Seeing her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over, and then murmured: “Qiao Nan, it's good for you and you to die. At least you can help your sister if you die." Zijin has a kidney, and so does the money!”
The little daughter was killed, and the person who hit the little daughter must lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes widened and she stared at Ding Jiayi desperately. Before the ambulance staff arrived, she couldn't bear to be angry with Ding Jiayi!
Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that one moment you are still fantasizing about heaven, but the next moment you find yourself in hell.
Mo Wen is such a person. Two months ago, he was still sitting in the classroom, fantasizing about being admitted to Xinyi's key university, but at this time he was doing a small job on a construction site exposed to the scorching sun.
Thinking of his tragic encounter, Mo Wen spit on the ground fiercely, raised his hand and wiped the sweat that was constantly flowing on his face. I just finished moving a cart of bricks, and I was sweating profusely at this time.
Mo Wen, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, has an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean figure, and a pair of calm eyes. Perhaps the children of the poor are in charge early, and the young ones make people look a little young and old.
Putting the cement truck carrying bricks in his hand on the side of the road, Mo Wen found a cool place and sat down. At this time, the foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy. In a boring and busy construction site, it is very happy to be lazy for a while.
He sat on a cement slab with a golden sword, his gaze constantly patrolling the road, and soon his eyes lit up; a graceful figure walked out across the road, which attracted his attention at once.
Although the distance is very far and the opponent's appearance is invisible, the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the posture of walking is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look at it as just a woman walking, but there is a lot of knowledge in it. And Mo Wen was guarding the construction site all day long, opposite the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to think of something, and pulled out a cyan metal disc from the clothes on his chest, only the size of a coin, with a small cyan iron chain tied to it, like a strange necklace.
This object was accidentally discovered by Mo Wen when he demolished an ancient house a few days ago. At that time, he found an ancient green brick in one of the walls. The green brick was potholed and broken. It is estimated that it is an ancient brick with a history of a hundred years.
If it is another antique with a hundred years of history, I am afraid it will be worth a little bit of money, but a piece of green brick, even an antique, is probably worthless at all.
At that time, Mo Wen threw the green brick on the ground casually, but he didn't want the green brick to break from it. A piece of metal jewelry fell out of it. It was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The cyan metal disc is a bit strange, divided into eight areas from the surface of the disc, with various strange runes carved on it.
Mo Wen is not familiar with antiquities, but he can also see that the thing in his hand should be a reduced version of the gossip plate. Ordinary people will hang the gossip plate at home to avoid evil and worship it as a magic weapon.
Although he is not superstitious and does not believe that the gossip plate can have the ability to avoid evil, he also knows that this ancient gossip plate should be of great value. Maybe it is still an antique. If it is sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to get rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing, and stroking the gossip necklace was like stroking his lover. Once he became a rich man, those big beauties who used to only dare to peek from a distance and swallow their saliva secretly were not for him to pick.
“Something happened.Something happened!”
“Something happened! Call an ambulance.”
A noisy shout sounded from not far away, and then many people ran to that place, and the shout also interrupted Mo Wen's beautiful dream at the same time.
He glanced over there suspiciously, hesitated for a while, stood up, and ran to the place where the crowd was gathering.
With a glance, he was startled by the situation in front of him. A middle-aged man who was nearly fifty years old and dressed in rags was lying on the ground twitching constantly, pale, breathing heavily, and holding his chest tightly with his hands, as if in pain.
From his eyes, there was deep fear, and he seemed to feel death.
Many workers came, but no one dared to step forward. A group of workers with little culture obviously didn't know what was going on and didn't dare to take action rashly.
“Acute myocardial infarction!”
Mo Wen's complexion changed slightly, and he looked at Lao Zhang twitching on the ground a little unsightly. He recognized Lao Zhang's illness at a glance, because someone in the village had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes. He witnessed the whole process with his own eyes.
The village where he is located is very remote, and there are basically no professional doctors in the village. Usually, if you have a disease or something, you use the earthwork passed down from your ancestors to simply treat it. There is no targeted treatment at all.
And his mother is sickly and tired. There is no doctor in the village. His biggest dream is to be admitted to the most famous medical university in the country. In the future, he will become a doctor to treat his mother and the people in the village.
It's a pity that he lost the college entrance examination. He could have been admitted to the Department of Medicine of Huaxia University with his score and was eligible for free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son in the family. Obviously, the score was lower than him, but he was squeezed out.
Although he can still be admitted to other good schools with his grades, the high tuition fees are expenses he can't afford at all. In order not to burden his mother, he can only give up his studies and start working part-time to make money.
The construction site belongs to a development zone on the edge of the city and is far from the city. It takes 25 minutes for an ambulance from the nearest hospital to arrive. It can be seen that the patient looks like, whether he can hold on for 25 minutes is still a matter of two words. Hold on for 25 minutes?That is simply a miracle!
He knows this person who lives in the same workshop as him. His name is Zhang Chenchen. Usually everyone calls him Lao Zhang. He is an honest and honest person. Because he has no skills, he can only do the lowest-level work on the construction site like him. .
It is said that he also has a son who is in college, and he worked so hard to make money for his son to go to college.
Mo Wen looked at Lao Zhang, a worker on the ground with some hesitation. His dream is to become a doctor. He has a certain understanding of the pathology of some simple and common conditions. For acute myocardial infarction, he knows that there are several first aid measures that can relieve the condition. .
But these days, who dares to save people casually? It is naturally a good thing to be able to save a good person, but in case someone can't be saved, if something happens to the patient, the responsibility will probably be placed on him.
However, society is so realistic. Perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the condition and prolong the time of death can save a life. But Mo Wen, like everyone else around him, did not dare to rush forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was silent for a while, then finally sighed and stepped towards Lao Zhang who was in a coma. He is not a bad person, but Lao Zhang has a good relationship with him. They are all poor rural people who come out to work and deeply understand each other's difficulties. Lao Zhang is the pillar of the whole family. Watching Lao Zhang die, his conscience can't do it.
“Don't touch him, I'm a doctor.”
A graceful figure ran from a distance, all the way through the messy construction site, trotting to the site of the incident.
Mo Wen was taken aback for a moment, and subconsciously stopped. A gust of fragrant wind hit, and there was an extra graceful figure in front of him.
It was a girl with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She was wearing an off-white floral skirt with the skirt falling at the bend of her legs, revealing a pair of slender and fair calves. Along the way, the clothes fluttered and moved beautifully.
Mo Wen's eyes couldn't help but stay for a while. He squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but it was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl! A beautiful face that was naturally carved and decorated kept echoing in his mind!Without applying zinfandel, it is amazing.
He discovered that the girl in the white dress was the woman who had quietly committed adultery with her figure across the road before. Only now do I know that people are not only in good shape, but also have surprisingly beautiful faces.
The girl ignored Mo Qiang and squatted down to check Lao Zhang's condition. Soon, her beautiful face changed, and it seemed that the situation was a bit serious.
Mo Wen also knew that the patient was in shock at this time, and the situation was very optimistic.
“Can you help me?”
The girl raised her head and glanced at Mo Wen anxiously. At this time, Mo Wen was closest to the patient, and naturally she found him the first time.
“Yes!”
Mo Wen was taken aback for a moment. He didn't expect the girl to ask him for help, but he quickly reacted and hurriedly walked to the girl.
“Can you help me straighten his body and lift his legs slightly?"”The girl asked Mo while carefully performing external chest squeezing surgery on Lao Zhang.
Mo Wen knew some ways to relieve myocardial infarction, and soon followed what the girl said. He knew that the method the girl said was correct. Lifting the patient's legs was to prevent hypoxia in the brain of the shock patient. Now that there is no oxygen tank and other equipment, doing so is the best solution.
He suddenly found that his chest was a little hot, and it was getting hotter and hotter. It seemed that a red-hot iron block was sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest and found that it was the gossip plate unearthed from the cyan ancient brick.
Anlin stood on the top of the high-rise building, facing the hustle and bustle of the wind.
The wind was howling, and the sense of weightlessness that fell sharply, even though he was already in love with him, he still screamed in fright.“Help! ！ ！”
The fear that death was coming enveloped his whole body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, Anlin's whole body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light mass.
A terrible sense of overweight also came at this moment. He felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then circling in a arc and flying into the sky.
Anlin's screams continued, and after his body flew into the sky, he landed on the roof again.
The extremely severe overweight and weightlessness, as well as the feeling of alternation between life and death, made An Lin feel dizzy in his head, and then vomited unconvincingly.
“Hey, young man, are you better?”At this moment, an ethereal voice reached An Lin's ears.
He looked up and found an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man's beard and hair are all white, the bones of the immortal wind, and the golden fairy aura lingers all over his body, with a holy and flawless appearance.
Seeing this scene, An Lin's whole body was shocked, and countless plots poured into his heart.
All kinds of plots began to appear in An Lin's mind, isn't the beginning of all the dreams just the scene in front of him!
Puff!
An Lin kowtowed heavily, tears filled his eyes and said, "Fairy, thank you for saving me!”
The old man who was called a fairy by An Lin stroked his white beard and smiled slightly: "Young man, you are in a good age, why do you choose to live a young life?"”
“My mother died young, and my father was addicted to gambling.”After my father gambled away the house, he owed millions of gambling debts and was unable to repay them, and then ran away alone!"”
“Millions! What shall I pay back?”
“After that, I was forced to drop out of school and work as a coolie for my creditors.”
An Lin confided in tears with a snot on her nose, only to feel that her life was gray.What is the difference between a life that has been paying off debts for a lifetime and a salted fish, it is better to be reincarnated earlier.
After listening to An Lin's experience, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes. He slowly said, “Young man, your life is really hard...Well, you and I are destined to meet, and I think you are very qualified. It's better to let this immortal give you a set of'system‘ and let you change your life.”
An Lin trembled when he heard this. He thought it was a great blessing to be able to form a fairy fate with the fairy, but he didn't expect the fairy to be so generous, and he would give it away as soon as he met!
“Oh, Grandpa Fairy, you are really kind to me! I really don't know how to repay you!”
The immortal smiled lovingly, his palm turned to the sky, and then an extremely white ball of light appeared in his palm.
“Young man, come here and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand."The fairy said to An Lin.
Hearing this, An Lin was very excited and couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light in his hand exudes a trace of warm current, and the light exuding in the ball is extremely soft.
“Start the system transfer."The fairy said slowly.
As soon as the fairy's words fell, the light on the white ball of light was full of glory!
At this moment, the immortal said to An Lin: "Young man, take an oath and swear to accept this God of War system and never give up for the rest of your life!"”
God of War system?
What a domineering name!
But how does this vow look like a marriage declaration?
Without time to think about it, An Lin hurriedly said: “I swear, accept the God of War system and never give up for the rest of my life!”
As soon as Anlin's oath was finished, the ball of light whizzed directly into his body and merged with him.
Immediately afterwards, a voice sounded in his mind: “It is detected that the host is a Tianming Dao physique and meets the qualifications, and the system begins to integrate!”
An Lin was very excited, so excited that he wanted to cry.
I originally thought that my life was gloomy, but I didn't expect to turn around, and I ushered in the life of the open-hanging system at this moment!
The fairy was also very excited, and so excited that she was already crying!
“Grandpa Fairy, what's wrong with you, are you okay?"Seeing the old man behaving strangely, An Lin asked curiously.
The fairy recovered and wiped away her tears, knowing that she had lost her temper.
“Young man, after you get the system, you have to cheer up."The immortal said solemnly.
“Hmm! I will!"An Lin nodded heavily.
“So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortals?"The fairy then asked.
Go to school to cultivate immortals? A fool will refuse, okay!
“Think about it, I especially want to cultivate immortals!”
An Lin almost didn't even think about it, so he replied. The immortal smiled with relief, took out a piece of golden paper and handed it to An Lin, and then said: “This is my letter of recommendation. With it, you can go to Xiuxian United University to study and officially embark on the road to Xiuxian.”
An Lin was taken aback, and he dared to love this Longaotian path of cultivating immortals, and the immortals had paved it for him!
He solemnly accepted the letter of recommendation from the immortal to himself, and looked at the immortal with gratitude.
An Lin was very curious about the fairy who gave him a new life.
“The name... let's not talk about it."The fairy stroked An Lin's head lightly, with a sympathetic look on her face.
“I have to go, goodbye young man.”
The fairy bid farewell to Anlin, and then flew away in the clouds and mist.
“Fairy, take care!"An Lin bowed gratefully to the immortal flying into the sky.
The laughter of the immortals came from the sky, and the laughter was extremely refreshing and wanton, as if pouring out a lifetime of injustice.
Why is this fairy so happy, how can she feel happier than me?
An Lin looked puzzled.
At this moment, a female voice sounded in An Lin's consciousness: "Hello.”
This female voice is wonderful and beautiful, like the sounds of nature, and An Lin is clever all over her body.
Is this the sound of the system?
An Lin was puzzled.
At this moment, an interface appeared in An Lin's mind.
The interface is gray, and only a few words are displayed on it: the function of the God of War system will be activated after entering the Taichu Continent.
What the hell was the mainland in the beginning?
An Lin thought of the letter of recommendation from the immortal, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Then, he found that there was nothing in the golden paper, only a slightly sunken handprint.
An Lin was a little unclear, but he still took advantage of the situation to put his hand on the paper, coinciding with the handprint.
Suddenly, the golden light of the paper was prosperous, and An Lin only had time to “huh” in surprise, and he was completely swallowed by the golden light.
An Lin only felt that the sky was spinning for a while, and his vision changed from dark to bright again.
Then he found that his body appeared in the sky again and began to land freely.
An Lin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off a building. No matter how many times that sourness came, he wanted to shed tears.
An Lin raised his head with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two white-patterned dragon pillars up to a hundred feet high stood between the sky, and the plaque was engraved with mysterious fonts that he could not understand.
Behind the gate, there are thousands of palaces, and there is no end in sight.
Colorful clouds floated around the palace, and various spirit beasts soared between the heavens and the earth, a grand and magnificent fairy family atmosphere.
An Lin stood still, with a shocked look on his face.
It turns out that there is really a fairyland in this world!
An Lin tried to calm down his emotions and calm himself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a robe coming and hurriedly went up to say hello.
“Hello, Sister Fairy."An Lin beckoned to the woman.
The beautiful-looking woman saw An Lin beckoning to her and walked over.
Seeing this, An Lin asked with some excitement: "This beautiful fairy sister, where is this place? I am a newcomer and I don't know much about this place.”
Hearing An Lin's words, the woman looked a little weird, and then said, “Muttering?”
“Ah, what did you say?"An Lin was a little puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as An Lin, and said, “Grumbling, grumbling, grumbling?”
An Lin was blindfolded at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
“Sister Fairy, do you speak Mandarin?"An Lin's eyes were a little wet.
“Gollum, gollum, gollum, gollum, gollum?”The beautiful woman crossed her waist with her hands, a little angry.
It's over, the language is not clear.
What the hell is she talking about? I don't understand at all!
！ Nani? Finally, An Lin cried.
"Roar!”
"Roar!”
"Roar!”
On a platform, hundreds of people screamed and cheered together, and there were dozens of cars around the crowd, most of which were supercars.
The most eye-catching place is the two cars that are about to start.
One is the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488 in the audience, worth more than four million, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang in the audience, worth half a million. The two cars are in stark contrast.
This is the duel between Liu Feng, the new young master of Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the top four young masters.
Beside the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han leaned silently on the car door. His clothes were sloppy and his hair was very long. When he lowered his head, Liu Hai'er covered his eyes. People couldn't see his closed eyes. From the lower half of his leaked knife-carved cheeks, you can still vaguely see the unique handsome look of Zhang Dashao back then, but now his temperament has become full of decadence.
And Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, was like the stars and the moon, his expression seemed to be saying that the world was under his feet.
“Let's go and see the young Master Zhang who used to be high above.”
Liu Feng waved his hand, with a sneer hanging from the corner of his mouth, and walked over.
“Young Master Zhang?”
“Are you asleep? Young Master Zhang, who used to be extraordinary, is now in such a state of depression. Tsk tsk, before the game starts, what are you pretending to be cold, my young Master Zhang!”
“He looks like this now, I think he is a poor beggar!”
“No, I don't think he is even as good as asking for food. Maybe he is living on pig food.”
On the side of the Ford Mustang, stood a fat man with glasses, and there was a three or four-year-old girl by his lap.
The little girl is made of pink carved jade, wearing a white dress, and her delicate little face is like a cute princess in a fairy tale. Except for her messy hair, she is perfect, but at this time, the little girl's big clear eyes contain aggrieved tears. Listening to everyone's remarks about Zhang Han, she seemed to be about to cry.
If you put it in normal times, it is estimated that the cute appearance of the little girl will attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng's performance time alone.
A burst of ridicule and verbal abuse finally gave Zhang Han a hint of reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a blankness in his eyes. When he saw the behavior of the people in front of him, his eyes condensed, and his eyes were full of contempt for the world.
“Er and other ants dare to bark in front of the deity?”
Such an inexplicable sentence suddenly burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The audience was quiet, but the next moment, a sarcastic laugh sounded.
“Zhang Han, I think you are crazy, right?”
“I'm afraid I didn't become a fool.”
Everyone laughed again, but when Zhang Han saw the picture in front of him, he was stunned.
“Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng in Langxingshan in 2009?”
“Why am I here?”
“Am I crossing the tribulation?”
“Could it be.....Am I back?”
“I was reborn by the thunder of Jiuxiao God of Heavenly Tribulation?"A tremor flashed in Zhang Han's eyes.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in Beijing. Zhang Han's father was the patriarch at the time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of heaven and earth, but once when the family was traveling by plane, he was hit by a plane crash halfway. His parents and younger sister were killed. The second uncle Zhang Ming served as the patriarch, but he couldn't stop the Zhang family from being lonely.
Zhang Han was hit hard at the time. He believed that his family had been killed. He began to investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, privately, but he was discovered by him. In addition, Zhang Han had offended many people before and was eventually expelled from the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, and Zhang Han refuses to leave. He has always wanted to find out the matter clearly. The days are very hard, but he has always persisted until this wolf trekking incident.
I remember that when I was racing in this wolf trekking mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident and lost both arms. After five years of panting, I finally jumped off a cliff and survived. I didn't expect to enter the world of cultivation by accident.After starting to contact Xiuxian, Zhang Han awakened his natural supernatural power-Wen Baobiqi, and his nose could smell the breath of treasures within a certain range.
With this magical power, in five hundred years, Zhang Han abruptly used various treasures to accumulate his cultivation base to the extreme.，
“Why not five years ago?”
Zhang Han's expression raised a trace of loneliness.
Failure to fulfill filial piety has always been Zhang Han's biggest regret. Before his relatives left, he was young, frivolous and ignorant, causing a lot of trouble to his father, and he said a lot of words that made his mother sad. No matter how regretful all this is, it can't be restored.
Filial piety comes first. Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the beginning, his love for his parents in his heart was no lower than that of others.
The tree desires to be quiet and the wind does not stop, and the son wants to raise but does not stay.
“Zhang Han!”
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he saw Liu Feng looking at him coldly.
“You drove me out of Shangjing five years ago!
Today, five years later, Liu Feng, the king of my Los Angeles car, is back strongly, but you Zhang Han is no better than a pig and a dog! Remember, today I, Liu Jing, asked you Zhang Han to go out of the capital sideways!”
“Oh, so powerful? Zhang Han refused suspiciously: "Then I'm no better."”
“Zhang Han!”
Liu Feng shook Ferrari's car key in his hand and said, "As long as you beat me, this car is yours.”Then I will be kind and hard to come by."”
Zhang Han said with a smile on his brows.
“Heh.”
Liu Feng sneered, raised his hand and ordered everyone in his position: “Put up the screen!”
As the words fell, several TV screens were set up by the people behind them. At the same time, remote-controlled aircraft were also raised all over Langxingshan. The screens were turned on, and the shots from the remote-controlled aircraft were transmitted back one by one, reflecting the entire track of Langxingshan.
“Get ready to start!”
Liu Feng nodded secretly to the fat man with glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang and got into the Ferrari.
“Daddy (Daddy), come on (come on), beat the bad guys
“How can a very cute little girl just call someone dad?”
Zhang Han shook his head amused.
“Brother Han, you will definitely win!”
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han and made a look of encouragement.
“Borrow your good words, your car will bring me good luck.”
Zhang Han glanced at him faintly, and sat sideways in the mustang.
“Prepare!”
The engines of the two cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, a proud smile hung from the corner of Liu Feng's mouth.
The fat man on the back leaked a meaningful smile.
The eyes of the lovely princess at his feet were full of fear and worry, her eyes were filled with tears, and she was pitiful.
And Zhang Han in the mustang had a sneer at the corner of his mouth.
“Collude to harm me?”
“It's a pity, I'm not who I was back then.”Even if there is no cultivation base now, how can the ants like Er be able to provoke?"”
Chapter One
Rust Lake.
Federal No. 23 Special Garbage Disposal Site.
It is also known as the ”magic tomb".
With the continuous development of cultivating civilization, magic weapons that used to be high above and only cultivators could drive have entered millions of households and become an essential tool for ordinary people to travel, study and work at home.
While bringing convenience to life, it has also produced a large amount of scrap magic weapons and metal waste.
Most of these garbage magic weapons have a lot of spiritual power remaining, which is likely to cause radiation pollution. The talisman array used to build the magic weapon is extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion. If left alone, it will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there will always be a number of “special garbage disposal sites” to deal with scrap magic weapons.
The No. 23 special garbage disposal site is located in the southern suburbs of “Fugecheng”, an important federal city.
Under the dim sky, a polluted purple swamp exudes a strong stench. The mountain peaks composed of metal fragments are like hundreds of dinosaurs showing their backs from the swamp. The mountain peaks are filled with fragmented flying swords. Next to the flying sword sits a rusty spar puppet. The empty eye sockets have long been extinguished. The spirit fire, only the insects that feed on psionic energy poked their heads out of it, carefully looking at this dangerous “magic treasure cemetery”.
“Boom!”
Countless metal components scattered like heavenly flowers, splashing in all directions, and causing a series of collapses of several surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust in the sky, like a demon dancing, covering the entire sky.
Here, it seems to be a restricted area of life, and only insignificant cockroaches and worms regard it as a paradise.
Li Yao lay dormant behind a garbage mountain and licked his chapped lips. His khaki windbreaker was covered with dust, which made him blend in with the environment.
Glancing at the rising explosive cloud not far away, the boy's clear eyes did not show the slightest emotion, and he was unhappy.
It was only when the soil and metal fragments spattered into the garbage mountain where he was hiding that he shrank slightly into the depths of the garbage dump, and at the same time put on goggles that were enough to cover half of his face.
“Coming!”
At 3:52:38 in the afternoon, the daily routine garbage dumping time is also the carnival time for “garbage insects” like Li Yao!
The Lingzi watch worn on his left wrist is a hunting-specific model launched by the cultivator sect “Feilingzong” three years ago. It took him two months to repair it after he picked it up in the garbage mountain.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function, which can record vibration of special frequencies and notify the owner when a specific vibration comes from nearby.
This function was originally used to remind hunters that there may be powerful monsters nearby.
But after Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship was about to appear.
A moment later, accompanied by a trivial buzzing sound, more than a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust that covered the sky and the sun caused by the explosion had not dissipated, and more than a dozen small black spots were mixed in, and it was impossible to distinguish them at all.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose, touched a rune on the side of the goggles with his fingers, “Swish”, and the surface of the goggles turned blood red.
Under the scanning of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined with a round figure, clearly visible.
The hunting function of the Lingzi watch also firmly locked the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
“Garbage Ship No. 1327, it's you!”
From birth to the age of ten, Li Yao has been in the tomb of the Magic Weapon for ten years. He knows every inch of the land and every garbage ship in the sky. This “Garbage ship No. 1327” is specifically responsible for collecting garbage from the “Upper East Side” of Floating Ge City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy area in the city. There are many cultivators living in it, and the magic weapons they discard are also the most valuable.
Many magic weapons are even intact, but they are discarded indifferently by cultivators and rich people just because they are a little old or a new generation of products has been launched.
For Li Yao, what kind of garbage ship is this? It's a treasure ship full of gold mines!
“Whoosh!”
Li Yao exerted force on both feet, shooting out like a projectile, hurtling between the garbage mountains, rushing towards the smoke and dust, and rushing towards the "Garbage ship No. 1327"!
Surrounded by crumbling garbage mountains, and under his feet is a poisonous swamp with bubbles of “Gollum Gollum”, Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountains and forests. From time to time, he uses his strength in a prominent part of the garbage mountain. Every time he pedals, he can pop up dozens of meters away, and his movements are flowing and pleasing to the eye.
“Li Yao, you bastard, grab food with Lao Tzu again!”
At this moment, more than a dozen figures sprang up from behind several garbage mountains, almost dressed like Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood-red goggles and Lingzi watch.
These people were holding shovels and iron rods in their hands, menacing.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage insects that rely on the “No. 23 Special Garbage Disposal Site” to eat.
Where there are interests, there are struggles. Ships of abandoned magic weapons may be just garbage for the high-ranking cultivators, but for these poor people at the bottom, they are the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best mixed garbage worm in the magic treasure tomb. Naturally, it is also a thorn in the eyes and a thorn in the flesh of most garbage insects.
Li Yao didn't care. He smiled, his waist suddenly exerted force, and his figure was strangely folded. He turned ninety degrees without warning, avoiding a fat boy with angry eyebrows in front of him, and took advantage of the situation. He stepped on his fat face fiercely, taking advantage of this foot, the whole person swept out another thirty or forty meters.
“Feilong, everyone comes out to eat, who is faster than you, you should lose weight!"”
There was a huge red mark on the face of the obese boy, his nose was about to sink into the fat, and he screamed with anger. He ordered his subordinates to chase after him, and the group quickly entered the smoke and dust area.
There has just been an explosion here. It is extremely unstable. Dozens of garbage mountains will collapse at any time. Even the vicious Feilong group of teenagers can't help but slow down when they enter this place, watching Li Yaofeng drive fast.
Feilong couldn't help but spit.
Before the voice fell, another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic weapons rushed down like a flash flood!
“So spiritual!”
But I heard a scream from the smoke and dust: "Xiao Hei, help!”
A black light that was deeper than the night sky shot out, “dripping” in the metal torrents, and then rushed into the upper air, but it was a rusty, notched blade, and pitch-black flying sword. This flying sword has a huge hand guard that spreads like black wings. Li Yao is like a drowning person. Grasping the straw, he lay very awkwardly on the flying sword, his whole body was covered in black light, and he rushed to the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have already revealed their huge stature. Each garbage ship is hundreds of meters long, and its round body is like the legendary tortoise that supports the earth. Tens of thousands of runes are densely engraved on the “turtle shell”. The light flashes and the colors are colorful, helping these big guys weighing tens of thousands of tons resist the invasion of gravity.
“Wow!”
One by one, the hatchways on the abdomen of the “big tortoise” opened, gushing out overwhelming metal components and broken magic weapons, smashing into the ground fiercely.
For a while, the spiritual power of the entire heaven and earth stirred frantically, setting off a stormy wave!
Even the tens of thousands of tons of garbage ships were swaying left and right in the wave of spiritual power, bumping violently, and had to be separated desperately to reduce interference.
Feilong and others did not dare to approach easily, for fear of being affected.
Li Yao was still riding a black flying sword and rushing left and right in the wave of spiritual power. Although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as flexible as a loach.
Of course, he did not dare to face the stormy waves head-on, but relying on more than ten years of survival experience, he tried to find a relatively calm and safe area between the tides of spiritual power, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic weapon, the near-water tower comes first. Moon.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship roared like a behemoth, turned its direction, and set sail lazily, and the smoke and dust gradually dissipated.
Feilong finally climbed into the dense garbage dumping center point, and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand-new garbage mountain, looking at him with a smile.
"Damn it!”
Feilong's face was shaking violently, but his heart was quite tangled.
The garbage mountain chosen by Li Yao is quite ingenious. It is not the largest garbage mountain, and it does not look like the one with the richest materials.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing priceless garbage magic weapons.
If you continue to entangle Li Yao here, you might be profited by other garbage insects.
The figures of other garbage insects have appeared faintly around, and cheers rang out on many garbage mountains. It was because someone had discovered something of value.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, a brat, was still a student of the famous “Second High School Affiliated to the Chixiao School” in Fuge City.
The Chixiao Sect is a well-known major sect in the southern part of the Federation, with strong strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any true legends, he is not something that can be dealt with with three fists and two feet. Otherwise, he would not have been single-handedly fighting in the tomb of the magic weapon for more than ten years, still alive and kicking, and he also earned the nickname “vulture”!
But after leaving like this, where did his face rest?
His nose is still embedded in the meat! His heart was entangled, and a strong wind passed by. Feilong subconsciously stretched out his hand and copied it. His hand was cold, but it was a fist-sized scrap crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and said, “Feilong, everyone is out to make a living. Isn't it just that last time I robbed you of a'starlight'-level crystal brain, I didn't kill your dad. As for being so immortal?Here, I just found a "Snapdragon 17" crystal brain refined by "Qinglongmen’. It is the most advanced model. It can calculate more than 5,000 thoughts per second. Although it is burned out, I estimate that it can be sold for three or four thousand yuan. Just treat me as a filial piety to you, Brother Feilong. From then on, we will be even. How about?”
”You..." Feilong didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this, so he was stunned, scratching the fat on his face in disbelief.
“Hey, look over there, the people of the "Wild Wolf Gang" are almost here. They are not like me as a lone traveler. They will definitely eat dozens of garbage mountains and wipe them clean. They won't even leave you a screw!"Li Yao pointed to the west.
“Good boy, you have a set!Let's go, hurry up and scan the goods!”
A group of garbage insects scattered in all directions and rushed to the garbage mountain in all directions.
Li Yao breathed a long sigh of relief, sitting in the garbage dump with bean-sized beads of sweat rolling down his forehead, and a smiling face instantly became sad.
“Fat man, the ‘Snapdragon’-level crystal brain I finally discovered is cheaper for you in vain!”
“You wait, is my ‘Vulture Li Yao’ stuff so easy to get?
One day you will eat mine and spit it out for me, take mine and return it to me, plus interest, calculated according to loan sharks, let you know why everyone calls me a ’vulture who asks for money and doesn't want to die'!”
“No, you have to speed up. The bastards of the "Wild Wolf Gang’ are even more unreasonable than the Fat Dragon!”
“Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save people, not commit suicide!"”
“Don't lie to mom, you don't even know how to plan a dog, and you still save people? Besides, there is no one in the river!”
Wang Yao was speechless. Today, he came down from the mountain and saw someone falling into the water in the river next to the village. He hurriedly jumped down to save people. After jumping down, he remembered that he didn't know how to water at all. What's more ironic is that it's not a human who fell into the water. It's an inflatable doll, which is very realistic.
“There are still people in the village who use this thing so fashionable?！”
This was his last thought before he lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he was lying on the kang of his house, next to his parents, his brows tightened.
Then in less than a day, the whole village knew that the silly college student who had contracted the mountain and planted herbal medicines couldn't think about it, so he jumped into the river and committed suicide. “The current child, he has never experienced setbacks and can't stand the blow!”
“That child is probably going to school and going to college. How can a famous college student go home to farm now?"”
“That's it!”
“We won't grow this medicine anymore!”
The father who had been squatting on the side smoking a cigarette bag angrily popped out these words. The people in the village have a good face. Lao Wang panicked when he heard these words, and if he continued to plant it, it would be useless to lose some money. Maybe even his son will lose it.
“That's right, listen to your mother this time, stop growing herbs, and go to the city another day and ask your sister to help find a decent job. Your third uncle Changmao's children just graduated from an unknown school and found a job in the city. Now they all buy houses there!"Wang Yao's mother also helped from the side.
After hearing this, Wang Yao stopped raising the bar with his parents, so he nodded and accepted.
He was originally a student who graduated from a famous university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm, started his own business, and contracted a barren mountain in the village. He wanted to grow herbs and make a fortune.As a result, after he really started to do it, he discovered that this kind of herbal medicine is far less simple than he thought. It is not possible to be full of blood alone, and many things are not available in books, and can only rely on practice and experience.，
In the first year, the herbal medicine he planted suffered from insect disease and lost all his money. In the second year, the herbal medicine bloomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots. This was the third year. Seeing a bit of improvement, this happened again.
But after he became more comfortable, he went to Nanshan again. This is a barren mountain. Maybe because of the soil quality, it doesn't grow much crops. There are more than a dozen big chestnut trees and jujube trees. There is a large gentle slope on the mountain. There are a few acres of medicine fields that he has laboriously cultivated. For this reason, he also paid someone to build a hut on the mountain and turned on electricity to take care of these acres of medicine fields. In the ups and downs, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he devoted three years of hard work and said that he wanted to give up. He really couldn't bear it.
Looking at the herbs that were growing well, he stretched out his hand and touched them.
Do you want to try for another year?
“The herb is detected, the trigger condition is reached, does it activate the system?”
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
“What's the sound, who? ！”
All around, there are mountains, water and woods, but there is no one.
“Hiss, is it an illusion?”
“Is the system activated?”
The sound of machinery sounded again, as if it was on the cliff.
“There is a ghost!”
Wang Yao was full of excitement.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he said these words, a curtain of light appeared in front of him, like a panel of characters in Wang You.
Illusion, it must be an illusion.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light curtain that appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Barking, at this moment, a native dog rushed down from the mountain and came to him, spitting out his tongue and wagging his tail, looking very happy.
“Sanxian, where have you been again?”
This is a native dog raised by Wang Yao, who has been with him on this mountain for three years. One person and one dog entered the hut on the mountain, and Wang Yao went to bed, feeling a little dizzy.
“What the hell was that just now?”
He read the name of the person on one side again, but the light curtain appeared again, as if projected.
“Here we go again!”
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but something that really existed and could not be explained by science. There are character attributes, skills, and packages, just like online games.
Occupation level: Rookie (in fact, you can't even count as a bird, at most you can count as an egg!
Physique 1, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average level of normal adult men).
Is this true?He was completely blindfolded.
Great, he is growing herbs now, and this is what is missing! Wang Yao, who had recovered, jumped up excitedly, startled the “Sanxian” on the side.
There is also a skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to point but didn't look at it.
“Why can't it be opened?"He asked subconsciously.
“The herbs are not good to grow, so if you want to do something else, go shovel shit!"”
It seemed that he had heard his question, and such a line popped up on the panel.
Damn it, what's the situation? Who designed it, come out, I promise I won't kill you! “What is this again?”
Wang You clicked in the package column and found a sign like a water bottle.
Ancient spring pot, with ancient spring water in it, one bucket a day.
How to use it, can you reach out and take it?
As soon as Wang Yao's thoughts moved, there was one more thing in his hand. It was a wooden kettle, antique and antique. It was still quite weighty in his hand. With a gentle flick, there was water rattling inside.
“There is really water! Ancient spring water?”
He found a bucket from the room and poured out the water from the kettle. The small pot kept spilling water until the entire bucket was filled before it stopped spilling water.
So amazing?
！ Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket, very clean and pure, stretched out his hand and took a sip into his mouth, very sweet.
Delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. He drank three large bowls before stopping. After drinking the water, he felt a lot more comfortable and the tiredness on his body was eliminated.
Barking, the three people on the side circled around the bucket.
“Come on, have a drink too.”
Wang Yao also put a bowl in the basin where he drank water. The native dog quickly drank it all, then barked again and wagged his tail. Obviously, he hadn't drunk enough.
“Okay, let you drink enough!”
This person and a dog drank a full half bucket. If they hadn't panicked, it is estimated that this bucket of water would have been drunk by them.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter One I want to lose weight!
In the scorching summer, the Chiyun Rain forest in the eastern part of the Federation is filled with clouds and mist, like a layer of gauze, surrounded by towering ancient trees, criss-crossing, and in the lush canopy, sometimes a few birds rise into the air, neighing and soaring in the sky.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist forever, is no longer what people remember, but many years ago, it was directly pierced by an indescribable bronze ancient sword, revealing a small half of the tip of the sword!
This ancient sword seems to have experienced eternal years, coming from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes, and there is a strong coercion, forming a halo, enveloping the sky, as if it can suppress the earth, let all beings worship!
From a distance, this scene of Jianyang Rainforest looked like a picture scroll, until the buzzing sound came from a distance before it was broken. A red hot balloon boat is slowly flying above the rainforest.
The cabin of this hot air balloon is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and many men and women can be seen in groups of three or five on the deck, sometimes with laughter and laughter.
They are from Phoenix City Middle School. This year, they were admitted to one of the four major Taoists in the federation. The students of the Misty Taoists are taking this airship belonging to the Misty Taoists, crossing thousands of miles to study in the Misty Taoists.
Perhaps it is the expectation of studying. The journey is not boring for these young men and women. There are some hazy attractions between men and women, which makes this journey of thousands of miles more fun.
And because the road is far away, the airship is equipped with a restaurant, spiritual practice room, infirmary and other areas.
At this moment, there are many students in the airship's restaurant, and at one of the dining tables, there is a little fat man with a belly.
This little fat man is about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a wide blue robe, and his round face is barely beautiful. He is patting his stomach and making a patting sound, while regretfully looking at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him. Plate.
“This meal will rise by another three catties. Why didn't I hold back? If I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young.”
The little fat man frowned sorrowfully, and when he was remorseful, he burped. This little fat man's name is Wang Baole, and he is also a student who was admitted to the Misty Monastery this time. His dream in this life is to be an official and to become the president of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit. The reason why he has such a great ideal is inextricably linked to his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was young, his father often patted his head solemnly, sighing with emotion.
“Baole, it's better to be an official. You have to remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied. If you want not to be bullied, you can only be an official and become a master.”
At the beginning, Wang Baole didn't understand. Until he was in elementary school, he was scolded by the monitor for not handing in his homework on time. After he gave two pieces of candy, he was named by the monitor and reported to the teacher. All this left an indelible mark in his young heart.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be the monitor, not to bully people, but to protect himself from being bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he found that there were still many people who could bully the squad leader, so he felt that when he became the biggest official, that is, the president of the Federation, no one really dared to bully him. The reason why he sharpened his head and was admitted to the Misty Taoist Temple is also because all the senior officials of the federation graduated from the four Great Taoists.
It's just that his life is not very good, and the family bloodline is very wonderful. He still remembers that night a year ago, his father, who was as thin as wood, gave him a look at the genealogy in the family ancestral hall.
It was the first time Wang Baole saw the genealogy. He clearly saw that generations of ancestors, anyone who weighed more than two hundred catties, all died young and did not live to be thirty-five.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... Before he could become the president of the Federation, he was reunited with those fat grandfathers.
In the following year, for him, the matter of weight loss had risen to a certain height, but even after entering the Spiritual Yuan Dynasty, with the enrichment of aura and the recovery of ancient martial arts, there were various ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole tried almost everything, and his weight remained steady. Progress.
The emergence of the memory made Wang Baole gritted his teeth fiercely and made up his mind to lose weight tomorrow.
After making such a decision, Wang Baole suddenly felt a lot less pressure. While picking his teeth, he hummed a little song, looked up at the blue sky outside the window in the distance, and his mind began to come alive.
“I don't know if he likes the gift for Dr. Lu. It's an antique I bought from home. The old guy should like it.”
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he was close to Dr. Lu, he would have a small backer in the monastery in the future.
“The teacher has limited power, but he will give some gifts in the future, but this doctor Lu is very old and must have a lot of contacts. I should be right at this step.”
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was happy, only to feel that he was one step closer to the position of the president of the Federation.
He is very confident that he can become the president of the Federation. This confidence mainly comes from the autobiographies of all the senior officials he has studied since he was a child, and he even summed up a few tricks to be an official killer.
At this moment of physical and mental pleasure, Wang Baole looked at the blue sky outside the window and felt very beautiful.
But soon, his eyes widened suddenly, and he noticed that in the distant sky, there was a black cloud condensed, diffuse as if to cover the sky, there was thunder and lightning inside, flashing electric light, slowly approaching, this scene also attracted the attention of many students, exclaimed.
Wang Baole was also taken aback. It was really after stepping into the Lingyuan Era. Due to the emergence of aura, a lot of amazing weather has bred in the heavens and the earth. It used to be difficult for flying objects to be safe, so there was the birth of a hot air balloon airship driven by spirit stones.
With constant exclamations, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, and the loud noise was shocking. You can see the rapid growth of the thunder magnetic black cloud in the distance, and the lightning inside has spread, like a big black net, flashing in the sky, dazzling and shocking, people can't help but speed up, the airship that was originally traveling is also slowly slowing down at this moment.
Just when everyone was upset, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, as if the wind was whistling, and an old man wearing a white robe walked in. The old man had wrinkles on his face, but he was immortal and had a straight face, especially his eyes were shining brightly, and his whole body was scattered all over the place. As soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
“Everyone, report to the spiritual cultivation room immediately, put on your magnetic spirit suits, and after half a pillar of incense, we will enter the thunder magnetic zone!”
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the restaurant were in awe and hurriedly stood up.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up. The old man in front of him was Dr. Lu who had given the gift before. At this moment, looking at the opponent's dragon-like tiger-like momentum, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was correct. Secretly, this old guy must be very human, and he is even better at chess.
When he was happily proud, the old doctor glanced at Wang Baole, snorted, walked over, took out half of the black mask from his arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
“At a young age, don't put your mind on some messy places. You learned to give gifts before you entered the Taoist academy. The old man is also a well-informed person. Keep your mask for yourself.”The old doctor looked solemn, with a clean and upright appearance, as if he hated iron but not steel, and reprimanded him.
Wang Baole took the mask and let out a thump in his heart. He saw that the old doctor was angry and a little anxious. He just wanted to explain, but suddenly thought of the killer skills he had summed up in the autobiographies of those senior officials. One of them is to admit mistakes in front of the boss with a thick face and the first time, which can often turn big things into small things.
So he took a deep breath, quickly put on a look of repentance, and admitted his mistake.
“The teacher is right, I was wrong!”
The old doctor was a little surprised. He was originally going to reprimand him, but because the other party confessed his mistake so happily, some of them couldn't go on.
Seeing the old doctor's expression, Wang Baole breathed a sigh of relief, and was a little proud, secretly saying that this autobiography is indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, raised his head and scanned all the students in the entire restaurant, pointing to everyone with his right hand.
“And you, you are all future students of my Ethereal Monastery. Look at what you are like these days. You must always remember that our generation of warriors should stand up first, then speak, and then act!”
The old doctor hated it deeply. These words reverberated in the restaurant. After everyone heard them, they couldn't help but bow their heads and were a little ashamed. Here, Wang Baole's eyes lit up suddenly, feeling that it was time to express himself.
So he quickly took out a small notebook from his arms and recorded it on it. From time to time, he looked up at the old doctor with a listening expression, and sometimes nodded seriously, as if to remember every word the other party said. This trick is also the killer he summed up in the autobiography of a senior official.
When other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole like a man of God.
After seeing it, the old doctor also stayed for an instant. An unprecedented sense of weirdness couldn't help but surface in his heart. It was really the first time he had ushered in so many students. This was the first time he had met such a wonderful person. I couldn't help but look at it a few more times, but I gradually sneered.
“Little guy, the old man's flattery is not so easy to shoot. You have to thank this thunderstorm. Otherwise, the old man can train for three days and three nights in one breath. I see if you can write it all in a small book!”
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, the momentum suddenly changed. A strong aura exuded from his body, as if it had turned into coercion, enveloping the entire restaurant. All the students were stunned, only to feel that this fighting method was still one foot taller than the old doctor. .
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording Yujian in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and then looked at the approaching thunderstorm. He still gave up the idea of taking it out. He felt that it was not embarrassing to be bullied in front of his boss.
Seeing everyone's expressions, the old doctor was proud in his heart, and said a few impassioned words.
“Remember, you have to put your mind on cultivation. In the future, you must not be greedy or unrighteous. Let alone always thinking about finding a female companion, you must have a knife on your head. These days, your lovemaking is really outrageous!”
Having said that, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out of the old doctor's voice bracelet.
“Grandpa doctor, where are you? People don't know how to wear this magnetic spirit suit. Come and help me.”
The voice was charming. When the old doctor heard it, he shook his body involuntarily, coughed barely, and glared at everyone seriously. Then he turned and left in a hurry, and at the same time spoke excitedly at the spirit bracelet. “Oh, it's coming, it's coming, baby, don't worry, I'll come over to help you.”
The reversal of this scene was too fast and the contrast was too great. Everyone was dumbfounded. Even Wang Baole was stunned for a while. It took a long time to take a breath. With the uproar that everyone couldn't help, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and cursed a few words.
”This old pervert, what he said before is bullshit! There are only so many female classmates, and we are not enough. At such an old age, he still comes to grab resources with us. Isn't he an official based on his size?”
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the more angry he became. In the discussion with the classmates around him, his dream of becoming an official became stronger in his heart.
As the sound of the siren intensified, everyone ended their discussion, and one by one went to the spiritual cultivation room angrily from the bottom of their hearts.
The spiritual cultivation room is located in the core area of the airship. As the name suggests, it is a place for these students to practice. At the same time, it is also the most tightly protected place for the airship to pass through special areas.
At this moment in this spiritual cultivation room, as everyone gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher who accompanied the ship in the Ethereal Monastery, everyone sat in several rows and put on the special magnetic spirit suits for airships issued by the ethereal Monastery.
Just after putting on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole was immersed in his resentment towards Dr. Lu. He looked up at random and looked around. His already depressed mood was suddenly aggravated by a gaze from a distance. Unconsciously, his brows frowned, showing disgust. Look.
Where he looked, there was a girl with slender legs sitting, which was very moving, but she was also frowning, showing disgust. Obviously, in their mutual gaze, the other party was familiar and extremely disgusted.
“Bad luck!”
Both of them muttered from the bottom of their hearts, and hurriedly avoided their eyes, as if they felt hot eyes even when they glanced at each other.
“Du Min, who can meet this tablet everywhere, is so annoying!” “What's so great, isn't it just a broken squad leader? When I arrive at the Taoist Temple, with my officialdom killer skills, Lao Tzu can also be a half-official!"”
Soon, after everyone was dressed, and the teachers who accompanied the ship in the Ethereal Monastery checked one by one, they explained some precautions, and even severely warned everyone that after the airship enters the thunder magnetic zone, there is danger, and there may be a life-and-death crisis.
After seeing everyone's expressions change, the teachers who accompanied the ship left in awe, and the door of the spiritual cultivation room was directly sealed, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment in the spiritual cultivation room, although there are still whispered conversations, as time goes by, the tension becomes stronger and stronger, and gradually no one speaks, falling into complete silence.
In the silence that seemed to be able to hear his own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in indignation, couldn't help but get nervous, until after Banzhuxiang, the entire airship suddenly shook and entered the thunder magnetic area!
From the outside, the entire thunder magnetic black cloud is extremely majestic, like a big mouth, compared with it, it is a very small hot air balloon airship, directly swallowed.
This kind of weather seems to contain the power of destruction and can sweep everything. Perhaps only the shocking Jianyang in the sky can ignore everything, as if looking down on the world for thirty-seven years is not enough, it will take longer.
This year is the thirty-seventh year of Lingyuan.
In 3029 AD, the earth's scientific and technological development was rapid, there were no national boundaries, the unification of the earth was realized, and the era of federation was entered. It was also at this time that a big sword flew from the starry sky and penetrated the sun, causing a sensation in the world.
The hilt of this great sword may have been broken because it was already broken. In this violent vibration, a large number of fragments broke and scattered all over the starry sky, some of which fell all over the earth.
With the arrival of the bronze sword, as the fragments fell, there was suddenly an endless supply of new energy on the earth that seemed to permeate the heavens and the earth. It was later named...Aura!
The aura is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin, and because of the scattered fragments obtained by the Federation and various forces, various exercises related to cultivation and alchemy, alchemy, and spirit refining stones have been found on it. The text on it is full of ancient meaning, which has led people to contact ancient texts and become a trend.
The emergence of reiki has also quickly eliminated the original energy sources and changed people's lives. It not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the process of earth civilization, causing the entire earth to start a spiritual civilization.
Since then, ancient martial arts have emerged, the world has undergone great changes, and the era of cultivating immortals for the whole people has begun.
According to history, Ling Yuanji.
At this moment, in the thunder magnetic black cloud, the slowly moving red hot air balloon airship, surrounded by countless lightning bolts, is constantly bombarded. Fortunately, there is a soft light curtain to diffuse protection around, making the airship extremely stable.
As for the spiritual cultivation room in the core area of the cabin, all the students, including Wang Baole, were already asleep unconsciously at this moment, as if there was a strange force that guided them into the dream.
Only in the main pavilion at the bow of the ship, there are seven or eight teachers at this moment, some drinking tea, some smiling, and talking easily with each other, which is very different from the way they scared the students before.
The leader was an old man with wrinkles on his face, holding a cigarette gun, and smoking from mouth to mouth. If Wang Baole were here, he would definitely recognize at a glance that this old man was the shameless Doctor Lu before.
As a middle-aged teacher spoke, the old doctor who was smoking a cigarette smiled slightly.
