Geesthacht: New planting boards to encourage people to replant
Franko Stein (DG Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The 'Ghost in the City' initiative also includes information on what is blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the town government. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day-care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015. Goal: The Geesthacht urban area is to develop large flowering islands on which insects can find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out in January to look for food", says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has bee hives on the property.
In order to ensure that the project is not only an action of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also reaches wide circles in the private gardens, explanatory boards are always placed for the plants. Approximately 50 signs have been placed so far. Passersby should thus be able to find out what is flourishing so nicely here.
In the first week of January, the season for wild hazel
More recent are shrubs such as winter cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the earth of the buckets on the Bergedorer street for a year now, now have the first delicate white and pink blossoms and have recently been thought with additional signs. "The winter cherry is a very broad bush and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide", is to be read there among further details, such as the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers, in the first week of January the season for the Wildhazel has already begun. it blooms especially abundantly on the dirt road at the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holertstraße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "The steppe keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would be proud of you when he looks down from the sky at Munich East station!
Every Monday at 3:00 p.m. there, at the Mandolin Motion Show Academy, three ladies meet for a rapturous tap dance - together they're an incredible 277 years old, pardoned young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing are my life, I can't imagine living without".
Ernestine is joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79).
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, she worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
Elfriede Widmann, 79 years old, is like the chick in the tap-dancing ring and says, "We are simply having fun here with our dance teacher, Sissy Engl".
The tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known worldwide. With two metal plates, each more durable than the original wooden soles used, attached to the front and back of the shoe, rhythmic sounds are created during the dance, which match the visual impression and the music.
Sissi Engl, 77 years old, is the soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a large family, with us big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Sports keep me young", the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, eat well and don't drink alcohol".
Analogue in dialogue - The limits of the digital
With the digital transformation, many people are returning to analogue technology
The speed with which our daily lives have become digital has left us with little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapt our communication and working practices, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, you had three options: you could either be one of the six percent of lucky people who had a private connection, or you could be one of the lucky ones who had someone from that exclusive group living nearby and calling their relatives for a bottle of Cyclabberger, or you could find a telephone exchange -- not to forget the smell of the plastic earpiece or the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to call and see the other person's face -- video telephony.
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so.
Only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had resigned, the pro-EU leader of government was under enormous pressure, as she herself had explained by her resignation - apparently from pro-Russian forces opposed to her.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighbour of Ukraine that is suffering economically from the war, with inflation at over 40 percent, and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the legislature of Chisinau, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority of 63 out of 101 seats, so no problem in confirming the new head of the government and his cabinet.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians have become more popular with the support of the Kremlin.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 is the year of celebrations in Veitshöchheim, the fifth season is in full swing and celebrity was not long in coming.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
The Bavarian Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
The Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is taking it into space!
State Parliament speaker, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode, Bavarian Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy, Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne, wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff in Fasching: Bavarian Minister of the Interior, Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid at his side.
On the waltz: economy minister Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume and his partner, Tanja Schweiger, county councillor in the district of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition was not to be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The walking is the passion of the SPD group leader Florian von Brunn with the SPD state chairman, Ronja Endres.
Royal went on to become FDP leader Martin Hagen, who and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
He will certainly say more in the future, for in Veitshöchheim the chairman of the European Parliament Group, Mr Manfred Weber, was travelling as a pantomime, accompanied by Mrs Andrea.
Even if politics doesn't work out, he can still do magic, like Nuremberg OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
As a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back in the 1920s, the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, the director of the BR, Katja Wildermuth and the director of the BR culture program, Björn Wilhelm.
A small side kick against the climate activists by the Frankish crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Not to be missed were the first mayor of Veitshöchheim, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: A bold eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and closes with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, which is there as a TV expert, is still undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent permanent victor Bö from collecting his second gold on the race track.
There's little doubt that he will be in the hunt number three next. In the chase, Bo is once again the clear favorite, and his running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for misfire with a degree of frightening ease.
After the routine with a penalty round in the mixed relay had given all the chances of a medal for the opening round and it had only given place six, it did not run better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in lying down and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success in his career in this discipline in 2017.
In High Pile he surprisingly won six years ago with a 0.7 second lead over Bo. It was one of only three career successes Dolls has ever had on the podium this winter. The Beijing Olympic eight moved after his weak performance without words and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to the 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We have to stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will focus on the value of democracy, with both looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has pressed for preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test", Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to fight for democracy, for the democratic values that are the core of our strength". Lula retorted, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolating itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a by-election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by severe rioting. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is eerily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol two years ago, during which supporters of then-president Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening", Lula said. "Sounds familiar to me", replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note to the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF posters that showed the members of the Red Army faction being released for trial and firing?
In a country with a culture of denunciation that existed before Corona, the public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society.
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which is usually after redheads in the subway or onanists in the park, is putting out a new edition with the friends of the "war criminal" Putin. Since they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but from No. 1 to No. 5 (!) is Mrs. Wagenknecht, followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Now, I don't know anybody around me who reads this paper anymore, and if they do, it's high time it was, because we've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below it.
At the latest by now, in all fairness, Mrs Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, that is to say the peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need for any distinction any more)
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Design designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer, Christian-Oliver Moser, to Bild newspaper and RTL in the same terms, who said: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the competent court through his family lawyer for the dissolution of his partnership. I do not comment on the details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, rumors of separation have been around for about a year.After his participation in jungle camp, the fashion designer is already said to have moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports.
The SS massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane: the last survivor is dead
A memorial centre was established in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were not destroyed. French President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. He said Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France. He also contributed to Franco-German peace.
A curve for 14 houses: in Homeias, everyone knows everyone
The LZ-series Nordlippiske Weiler: In Homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof. Here the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles per day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even immediately return.
Deutsche Bank chief Christian Sewing believes that more interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high". "Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening up of China could also temporarily boost prices", Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
In the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time and envisaged a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for its meeting on 16 March.
High interest rates can make credit more expensive, which may reduce demand and thus counteract high inflation rates, and at the same time, high interest rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
"The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more severe than the higher cost of financing for some countries", said Sewing. "Of course we have to be aware of this, but a high level of debt must not deter the ECB from taking firm action".
As regards the euro area, the ECB is targeting price stability at 2% inflation over the medium term.This target has been far from reaching for several months.Even though the upturn in price inflation eased again in January, consumer prices in the euro area of the 20 countries now involved were still 8.5% higher than in the previous month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can then afford less for one euro.Strong energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, also burden businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later", warned Sewing, who is also chairman of the Bundesverband Deutscher Banken (BdB). "That is what I currently see as the biggest risk to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario".
Bosch chief Stefan Hartung hopes that there will be a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects, as promoted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And it will be a bit more controversial", he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge that does not have to go as fast as the LNG terminals that came into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened after ten months of planning and construction. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had talked about a new "Germany-Tempo" on the occasion.
"First, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters, but this should not automatically mean that from now on we should always act so categorically and put a windmill in our neighbour's garden against his will", said Hartung.
In the past, they tried and failed to do it with the traditional set of rules. "We should think again whether the previous approach was correct. Maybe we exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated".
He added that, given the many open tasks, such as the extension of the power lines, he was not jealous of the Federal Government and the companies involved: 'As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need this extension and it must be as green as possible.'
Union warns of destruction of the Bayer Group
"From the point of view of the employees, Bayer, with its three mains, is in just the right position for the challenges of the future", said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's executive board and of Bayer's supervisory board, to the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
These include the pharmaceutical prescription business, the consumer health nonprescription drug business and agriculture business. "The transformation of industry is only tackled with a business approach based on risk management and sustainability - not hedge fund activism".
In the background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday: the controversial head Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is set to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the people of Leverkusen had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate into the house.
It was known for some time that Baumann had not intended to extend his contract, which was originally to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors were pressuring. More recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have joined forces.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off of the "Consumer Health business would be a possible way to increase the value of the company", Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post.
Hundreds of thousands to demonstrate against pension reform
The Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
As the government plans to go ahead, unions are protesting in the streets, with hundreds of thousands of people planning to demonstrate against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate nationwide against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the plans of the Centre government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Over one million people have already taken to the streets twice and nationwide strikes have taken place. Last Tuesday 750,000 people participated in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week now.
Already many people in France are working longer than they need to until the age of 62 if they have not paid enough into a deduction free pension when they reach the age limit. Opponents of the reform believe that in many strenuous occupations people could hardly work longer.
Macron: Threat of a deficit in the pension fund
Macron reasons the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees with their contributions would have to pay for a growing number of pensioners. In order to keep the level of pension stable, the population should work a little more. Critics question the calculations of the government and demand that the state should find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
As well as lowering the retirement age, the government wants to speed up the increase in the required initial contribution period for a full pension, which it decided to increase years ago, to abolish individual pension systems with benefits for certain occupational groups and to raise the minimum pension to around €1200.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. A first attempt to implement the reform was canceled during the coronavirus pandemic, which led to massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron attempted to reform the French pension system, with varying success, and widely-spread protests and strikes were all expected.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in Parliament, it hopes to carry through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support, but some MPs, even those from Macron's faction, still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a narrow vote is now Macron's concern about crippling strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather is expected with plenty of sunshine in the high seas
A powerful area of high pressure over Central Europe controls the weather in Germany. Does that mean lots of sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Other
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected for at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately comes into view directly over Central Europe", explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "While this high temperature will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany".
But even calm high-pressure weather in the winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "It can be quite brutal and leave people in the lowlands with a dreary cloud for days, while in the high country it is sunny in the high mountain range".
From the Ardennes Mountains and the Thuringian forest to Lower Bavaria, it may rain according to the DWD. Especially at the Alpine edge, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens over the course of the day and the sun appears more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains highly cloudy or highly foggy. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, in the vicinity of the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which gradually becomes more intense, again bites at the high fog, and may melt away more and more during the day", says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high ranges of the Mittelgebirge and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia sunshine is expected all day, and elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high fog. The highs will range between 5 and 9 degrees; the lows in the Lower Rhine will be around 11 degrees; the permanent greys in the southeast, on the other hand, are expected to reach only 3 degrees. In addition, weaker winds are blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands again there can only be a tough resolution of fog or haze. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after fog resolution. In high places, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun shines according to the forecasts all day long. The temperatures rise to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
No more World Cup medal for Goggia
The top favourite, Sofia Goggia, was deeply disappointed after her exit in the downhill stages of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
French
"I am sad, because I did not provide the performance that I can", said the Italian woman in the ZDF after she had been roped in a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old could barely prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six seasons in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving, must wait for a world medal in her discipline.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was all about the hundredth of a second", Goggia said now after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it everything. But this is life". Sometimes you think that things are guaranteed, she said about the medallion expected by all experts and finally missed, "They are not".

Selensky and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
With the call for exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have stepped up pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
During a joint telephone conference they agreed to write a declaration to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues", said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The videoconference, held at the initiative of the United Kingdom, was a productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games, and we will now issue a joint statement on this topic".
Earlier, at an international video conference of sports ministers and other top officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskiy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions", Selenskiy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also considers Belarus a war party because the country is providing Russian troops military bases for attacks.Selensky called on officials to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from competing.The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its integrity".
The conference was prompted by the announcement of the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions; Ukraine also threatened to boycott if the IOC allowed them to compete.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
Afterwards, the Federal Interior Ministry responsible for sports stated that it had also reaffirmed during the discussions the rejection of any start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The effort of the IOC to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way", said a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior.
The Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) stressed at the end of January that "sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
Russia and Belarus are currently banned from many international competitions, but the IOC wants athletes from both countries to return to the international sporting arena, under a neutral flag, as long as they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.
Stepping up where it happens
"Hey, hot ass!" whistling at the dumb lady in a tight sexy outfit and shouting obscene sentences: all of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind that term there is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost: US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. "Presumably half of the main tank stock" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine", said Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide additional information regarding U.S. estimates of the number of tanks seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams tank tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin head Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernise thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, tanks", said Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, while visiting a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It's clear that in this case it's a matter of course for us to increase the production of various weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
A law came into force last summer in Russia which allows the economy to be better aligned with the needs of the army, for example by obliging certain industries to supply the armed forces.
The problem of vacancies in the army
The post to be held by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner was not advertised, the personnel representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects of post corruption and abuse of office.
The Minister stated that it was not necessary to make a tender as the appointment would take place in a previously vacant job; she did not want to comment on "speculation by an independent staff representative". Ortner had been dismissed last year after 17 years as head of the HGM; in addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he had faced serious allegations of bullying, which, according to Tanner, had been dismissed.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortner's content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current questions of security policy.
The SPÖ wants Tanner to clarify the "unusual ordering procedure". Robert Laimer, a SPÖ spokesman, says the decision has "the air of post hacking".The Neos want Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in corruption", said Douglas Hoyos, a spokesman for national defence.
Carnival: First Fools to Kneel at the Cost
In contrast to the state capital, the Thuringian carnival town of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional facing move, even though higher costs, including for security, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. e funds alone accounted for about half of the total estimated cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, no Carnival Parades are cancelled. The "Joyeous People's Parade" in Cottbus, arguably again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even the Swabian-Alemanic Fast Night has not been cancelled.
Even at the current high cost, the carnival society in Schleswig-Holstein is sticking to the traditional procession. "We are going through with our event", says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. However, financial problems continue to be pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were paying more, reserves would have to be tapped - "this is not possible every year". The current deficit is approximately EUR 200,000.
And the inflation: in the sweet, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Nürnberg Fastnachtzug promotion association. Thanks to luck in the misfortune, 2020 was over-ordered, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will become more expensive. For security, twice as many staff will be needed as in 2020.
Those on the outskirts of the way on the Rosenmontag train in the Rhineland might get fewer camels than previously. Because sweets have become more expensive, some participants will not have much. Camels to go, there might be a large demand of visitors: "I think that if it is not raining buckets on that day, we can certainly expect an increased demand", says train conductor Holger Kirsch from Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there has not been a regular Rosenmontag train for two years. Of course, there is nothing to replace the train".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on the costs, but generally speaking the train is "deficient", it is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered safe to drink for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lemberg. Every once in a while, I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries, like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can not tell much difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widespread. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, nobody knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health a few years ago claimed that consumption has dropped by an impressive 80 percent in five years. Well, you can hardly believe the Russians here. As a tourist, you should be cautious about it. But then, only if it is sold in the masses will this also go well.

If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or a beer at the end, there are great places in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the spotlight for club parties. Where is it the best? A look at the Google ratings will tell you.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favourite win and praises the High Court
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweeper Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution of the Oberhof World Cup sprint, but there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the tribune of honor on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range had actually fallen. "I had to get the results on my phone", Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted smilingly and referred to the foggy haze that kept pulling back into the stadium, which greatly affected the view on the grandstand for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by Biathlon", he said, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions.
Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured in 23:21.7 minutes the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after the triumph of Denise Herrmann-Wick. Johannes Kühn placed eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the gray veil.
He entered the race with the number one spot in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visual conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the best; they each landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his brother five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him", said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
"If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as a ten. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one", sports director Felix Bitterling called his "Lokomotive" to task. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 / ZDF and live Eurosport) a nearly sold out arena.
Brych dislikes "Swarm of bees" in the square
Felix Brych - The referee Felix Brych decides on the referee's ball.
German referees want to "punish in a consistent manner" unsportsmanlike conduct. Head referee Fröhlich points to a role model.
The German referee Felix Brych has noticed negative trends among each other on the court. "I already think that there are new behaviours of the players who after decisions surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area", the 47-year-old told the German press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it".
The two coaches with recent expulsions had also been considered. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, it was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The conduct of the coach also falls in the area of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards the referees has become a bit demanding or aggressive. Such unsportsmanship we want to consistently address", said Brych.
DFB-arbitral-chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good coexistence of coaches and non-partisans. "On the whole, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected party then has to live with this. It should not be anything world-moving", said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can cause conflict in the course of the game. But if emotionality turns into a personal insult, then you also have to accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee", said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared things up afterward. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking was also triggered overall, that such behaviour is simply not appropriate", said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Federation of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at a different level. "Of course events from professional football are always coloured. There is a role model effect, which leads to imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours", said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".
The combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal course and the ten-kilometer ski-jumping race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combiners will not compete in the Black Forest in the best team. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the World Championships in Oberstdorf, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels it of course", said German coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after road accident on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar Circle), including two children. According to a police notice, the accident occurred on Saturday, when a car driver crashed against a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed him onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) are standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition at the Marler Sculpture Museum ends with a few extras.
The closing speech to the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, 12 February, at 3 p.m. in the Transition Quarter of the Marler Sculpture Museum in the Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the artworks disappear, but a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It is presented on 12 February by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
As a conclusion, Dr Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the Community. Using numerous graphic examples, she will present the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic with an emphasis on NRW in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and graduated 2013 to the mural paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching on building-based art as well as art and institution history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art on the construction in NRW. After the lecture, the last curators' tour of the exhibition takes place.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about tree defects which led to the collapse of buildings: in the earthquake region of Turkey, the judicial authorities issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul: In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for suspected structural defects in buildings that collapsed during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people were arrested, state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The defendants are accused of structural defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating for possible building defects in collapsed buildings, and the investigation has so far issued 62 arrest warrants. One of the accused was reportedly caught at Istanbul airport trying to travel to Montenegro with cash, and is in pretrial detention. The nine others were arrested in the towns of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
A 7.7 magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 at noon, collapsing more than 7,500 buildings in Turkey alone.
Last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow has died, as the left-wing group in the German parliament has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night of Saturday. Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the group, praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95", the left wing of the Bundestag announced Saturday, and the party "will therefore lose an important figure", according to the party chairman Dietmar Bartsch and its former leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district executive of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on 13 November 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days.
Left Party leader Dietmar Bartsch, in a message on the news-short service Twitter, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist".
"In his old age he was an important adviser in our party, "whose wisdom will be lacking".
"The entire peaceful course of German unity was a special achievement of his. This will remain his political legacy", wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
"His later activities in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of also representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994, and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (DPA), Modrow had viewed the new state "quite critically". According to DPA, Modrow had criticized in many interviews that the German unity had been completed too quickly, the GDR had fallen too unconditionally, and it had been condemned as a "state of injustice".
What happened that night
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky has condemned Russian missile strikes, but Kiev is forced to repair the country's power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is forcing the energy grid of Ukraine to repair again, but Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. Electricity supply is especially bad in the Kharkov region. Due to instability in Ukraine's electricity grid, a reactor block at the Chmelnyzkyj CHP had to be cut, while production was curtailed at Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned the Russian attack on Friday with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terrorism, but in a video message told his countrymen how much support Ukraine has received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selensky doesn 't want to abandon the small town of Bachmut.
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Ukraine's key supporter, Poland, shortly before the anniversary. However, the threat of Russian missile attacks continued on the night of Saturday. In the capital Kiev, an air alert was triggered late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of attack by drones", the military administration of the Kiev region informed. Iranian-made combat drones were also observed and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiv and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects network company consultant
Demands from the election campaign, made by the FDP and the Greens among others, to separate them failed in the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should be oriented in the future to the public good, that is, it does not need to generate and deliver profits.
Restructuring budget of EUR 80 billion
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to follow-up with this process. The congestion on the railway network is an important reason why the railway is currently very punctual. Transport Minister Wissing has set out to eliminate this problem by completing the complete renovation of railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations, it is more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon world championships in Oberhof 2023 - gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
However, the external circumstances had obviously not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse did not drop as soon as she entered the race. "Such a race", and that at the World Cup, "you can not describe with words", she said. 11,000 spectators shouted to the thundering hit music with the flags of Germany, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", she had planned
The pressure was especially high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only German medal hope outside the relay started in the World Championship. Herrmann-Wick has been the only German to win two world cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And although the performance density among the women in the top is much higher than among the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, there were others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Nicaraguan bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison
The Bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state, accusing Ortega of suppressing religious freedom.Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018 as demonstrators calling for Ortegas' resignation sought refuge in churches.More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018.Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of reprisals or arrest.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have already been cancelled and further projects face the same threat as reported by Welt am Sonntag. "There is no need, even for the moment, to allocate specific procurement measures to any need for saving", says a response by the Federal Government to a request by Bundestag Member Ingo Gäensdech (CDU).
The background to the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates. The entirely loaned special funds, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans themselves. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation the purchasing power of the remaining amount decreases.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left on the Kupferzell motorway in the direction of Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver rode the B 19 toward Künzelsau, as the police reported.
Both persons involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident scene indicated "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not result in any complaint. Further investigations followed. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart people responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria and there is great grief - including in Stuttgart.
More than 200 people gathered in Stuttgart Castle Square on Friday night to remember and pray for the victims of the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria.
Many community members followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque congregation, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's entreaty seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from pests and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for the help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria, the speakers expressed their condolences for the victims and relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event, and the appeals were also translated into German in the castle plaza.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is high. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Federation Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
For several days, the Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in the street "Bellockenstraße" to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas.
A walk with a meat pack - Ebersberg
"After the meal you must rest or take a thousand steps ".... The elderly know the saying, the young simply put it into practice. However, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because thanks to Home Office, those who sit not in the middle of a stone desert, but just a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or to go out into the fresh air. At least this impression could be obtained around the Egglburger See, where between noon and 2 pm not only dogs are wandering around.
But one of the reasons could also be that the modern man, in an optimal time slot, can combine the health-enhancing supply of fresh air with other things. Why not take a short walk in nature and hear news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the friend with whom you never go to the cinema in the evening, not even in the old cinema? In this way, work and personal life could also be connected - because, who says that the meeting with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can not take place outdoors? Unless, of course, there are no outsiders in the vicinity.
One good thing that can be done is to buy fresh products, such as fresh fruit next to cheese on a table by the side of the road, or potatoes and meat. It is stupid if you do not think about the purchase in advance and make adequate preparations. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg, for instance, leaves the wooden shop room of the farmer empty-handed and with regrets in their voices. "Wretched, we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you have a wallet-bearing companion but no carrying container - as you let that nice casual acquaintance know - to which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" Pointing to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly puts over one's hair before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an extra headcloth superfluous. "My wife always packs everything there!"
And so it happens that you make the return journey with meat on top and that on this midday excursion, you will be enriched not only by a back-but also by a very practical idea, that the second walk is due that day - after dinner, this time actually to digest.
Trapped and badly injured
About 21.00 the 25-year-old drove in his Audi on the ring road towards Hailfingen and came off of the road in a left turn to the right for an unexplained cause, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, laterally bumped against a tree and stopped some meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The firefighters released him with a heavy device. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since the suspicion of drunk driving was, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report the Audi caused a fatality damage in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax returns: A point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that the Treasury Department must turn over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, when he was the President of the United States.
The Treasury Department must instruct the Internal Revenue Service to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department said in its Friday ruling.
Contrary to political conventions in the US, Trump did not disclose his tax returns as a candidate or later as president. He fought for a disclosure, fighting it all the way to the Supreme Court. The New York District Attorney's office now has the documents, but no details can be made public - unless there was a trial.
The issue of Congress is more sensitive for Trump: there, the circle of those entitled to access the data is somewhat larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the ruling as a "victory for the rule of law", tweeting that access to the Republican tax records was a matter of national security. "The American people deserve to know the facts on his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president", Pelosi said.

British criminal caught in Thailand after long escape
London - A convicted British drug trafficker has been captured in Thailand after five years on the run, the NCA said on Saturday, after being arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group, according to authorities, had fled early 2018 at the beginning of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (€9 million).

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the educated physicist from Lower Saxony who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits well in the general prevailing domestic science scepticism is unknown. In any case, his humor fits very well into Vienna.
The English language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, after all, he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. Now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences overseas, but also explains what knowledge is and what it can do and what not. There is, of course, Corona, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off -- what is really important? -- and does it with a big wink, and very calm, and very ironic, so that we're not just having fun, we're also learning in the process.

1. general
The single man entertainment device Battlezone is equipped with a vector or X / Y monitor. This game depicts the combat from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are carried out in a vast valley, completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plains there are rock pyramids and rock squares, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shells.
The player is presented with slow moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles that are increasingly difficult to hit, as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs still appear periodically. These can not attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game-conducting sequence, the game sequence, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test sequence.
4. Course of play
The gameplay is triggered when the START button is pressed, the LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds are heard. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game ends. The game begins with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of each enemy tank or missile can be determined by the player by observing the text displayed in the upper-left display corner of his cockpit.
The top cone on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, FIGHTING OUT MISSION is also shown in the upper left display.
UFO's are designed to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's armor as well as the enemy's armor. A shot through the armor earns the player 5,000 points in this mode. If an opponent is hit, the following long points are reached: 1,000 points for a falling armor, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a Super-Armour.
5. Initial input at highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum points in the highest score table, they can enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instruction is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that by triggering a self-test, disabling the RESET button on the Battlezone Analogue Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply, the table with the highest score is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest point numbers, along with their initials, are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players.
New parts
If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should note the important differences in these components. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI switch lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, which has made this assembly more stable and ensures a proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another change is the Zentrale rubber buckle, which, like a centralized spring, always returns the control lever to the central position. The microscopes are now more comfortable, making it easier to rotate with a self-healing motherboard. A new image stabilizer has been built, with the help of a new VINC-based design, to provide a higher resolution for the screen, the screen, and the networking of several consoles at the same time. This has been made possible by a larger screen, and an upgraded version of the console, with two VINC-based C series of console to support a higher resolution.
These new parts, as well as all the other major components of this appliance are shown in figure 1.
When removed from the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready for use, however, to complete the quality control, you should carry out a certain check. To have certainty that the device has been delivered to you in correct condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: The device is not yet connected to the 220 V network. A. Inspect the outside of the case for damage.
NOTE: Do not force plug connections. The connectors are fitted with a force guide, so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twist of the connector will destroy the PCB.
(2) Verify the connector connections to the Game PC board are in a correct and fixed location. (3) Note the production number of the device on the model label on the back of the device. (3) Check the serial number printed corresponds with those on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, the Auxiliary PC board, the Controller / Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. A map of the position of the production number can be seen on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided exactly when you call your dealership for more service information. (4) Check all other main components, such as the grid connection, to make sure the battery is connected properly, and the TV monitor with the correct label on the rear wall of the unit.
Do you have problems with your software?The following are a number of tips that may help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games.
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging.You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Program to get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements.To call the DirectX Diagnostic Program please do the following: Click the Start button and choose the Run option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text box.The DirectX Diagnostic Program user interface will now appear.Here you will have access to all the relevant system details including information about graphics and sound cards.You can also check if sound graphics are working correctly by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the DirectX Diagnostic Program to enable the DirectX Diagnostic Program to test you in case we don't know your computer's start rates and changes.
Some other programs may take over the system resources required for the game to run correctly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically booted at startup. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are called "Background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. That is why we recommend that you stop these background applications before you start the game. - If there are any antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, search for an icon in the Windows Taskbar.
Before you install software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working at its optimum. So you should make a habit of cleaning up your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleaning to keep everything running smoothly. Chances are then high that your current games on your PC run largely without problems. A clean system also has the advantage of being much more efficient and, consequently, running other applications you use faster and more reliably.
Click on the start button and select the Help option (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help.  Now click on the search box and type in the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Drug Tracking (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup. You will receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
To play games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your video card. This is often a good way to prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website.
How to stop all unnecessary background usage
Important note: After completing the game, you should reactivate the background applications by restarting your PC. This will automatically reactivate any background applications you left. Windows 98/ME
1.Keep STRG and ALT on your keyboard, then press ENTF. Now the Close application window will appear, listing all the background applications currently running on your system. 2.To quit a background application, click on the entry in the task menu and then on the Exit task button. Note: Do not quit the Explorer and Systray background applications under any circumstances, as these are needed to run Windows. All other background applications can be safely quit. 3.The window will now close and the task is finished. Repeat the above steps to quit all other background applications (up to Explorer and Systray on Windows 2000/PX Professional).
To close a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then press the "Finish the task" button. Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing STRG, ALT, and ENTF might not open the Windows Security window but the Windows Task Manager will appear in Windows XP Home.
(1) Hold down STRG and ALT keys on your keyboard and press ENTF. Now Windows Task Manager appears. (2) To stop a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar and then click the "End Task" button before calling the hotline.
If you wish to make a call, sit down at your PC and prepare the following information (see the section 'Checking System Configuration'), including notes. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98; Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Graphics and sound card and driver information
What is the role of the Commission?
The desire to develop video games was ignited in me by the advent of 3D real-time interactive technology, which suddenly opened a plethora of new possibilities in life and appeared to me a new form of expression, with which the world might be pushed to its limits. It presented for me a way to open new horizons. I felt for myself, as a pioneer of cinematography at the turn of the twentieth century, that, while I struggled with the still immature technology, on the one hand, I was aware that everything still had to be unearthed - especially a new language that had to be behind both narrative and fully visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my creative appetite. I felt that the fact that video games had been designed with only a few interactive features would give me the hope to explore the world with its boundaries. I thought that it would make the whole experience easier and that, if we had a chance to continue to build our own experiences of racing and play in a manner which would be more creative than the other forms of interactive play, it would give me the courage to continue to raise and question this very important and uncompromising fact that both the ability to create a new game and to be able to live outdo ourselves.

This SERVICE MANUAL is intended to familiarize you with the installation and maintenance of the QIX TV entertainment machine. On the front pages, in addition to important instructions for installation and maintenance, the course of the game is described. The following service tips are required for general knowledge of microprocessors, TTL circuits and TV monitors. Without knowledge in these areas, no repair of the electronic device should be attempted.
The information and pictures contained in this SERVICE MANUAL are current at the time of printing.
Damage caused by transport
Where external transport damage is recognizable, these must be denounced at once, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.).
The machine is set to the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to the VDE regulation, the machine is equipped with a protective conductor connector and intended only for dry rooms. The correct operation of the coin system requires the right setting of the machine.
IMPORTANT: If at any time there is an uncomprehensible signal on the monitor, please turn off the machine for a short while (pull out the power plug) and then turn it back on.
Remove power supply plug before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-carrying parts! Even if the equipment is off, the monitor can still produce dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! There are approximately 20000 volts at the anode connection of the image tube. Replace fuses only with those with the same values. A burnt fuse signals the overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never pressed circuits / connections when the equipment is switched on.
Game play
Pressing the corresponding start button starts the game for one or (at minimum 2 credits) 2 players. One has to try to get a lot of area, without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the travelling SPARX. The gameplay is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be covered before one can attack the next area (round). On the upper screen, the temporally controlled SPARX are shown by red timing lines. At intersections of the red lines will release additional SPARX. At an alarm, SPARX SUPER-SPARX will be updated and more aggressive. If you try to enclose your territory, your marking in your death sign will be reduced, you will not be able to achieve a full stop, you will not reach your destination, and you will be able to reach the control grid and destroy the control program after 4 seconds.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working correctly. See "Service Program" for additional information. The volume can be set in the volume controller (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC-Board.
Programming and testing switch: SUB-TEST
Function: Switch to the next stroke
Programming and test switch: TEST
Function: Switch to the next program step (display)
Programming and testing switch:
Function: Reset to factory setting (until green), counting by step (when green) Programming and testing Switch: Down
Function: counting down by one step
In the instrument, it is possible to install a coin counter, a line to 412 V DC supply, a line to socket J 15-13 on the ROM /IC board.
The Service Program
General: For programming and testing, the four switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming indicator. It selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The "Sub-Test" switch allows the setting of languages to be used. When the desired language - green - is available, the "Test" switch is pressed to switch to the next program display. Deposit programming. This indicator can be used to set the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that can be entered before the start of the game. The next move to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-"Test switch (green), the number of points to be gained is set to this value by pressing the "Upgraded Programming" or "Sub-"test" button. Multiple "test" buttons are displayed. Once the desired language appears, press the "Test" button to jump to the next program display. The program value can be set to green. Once this value is over 99 or "Sub"-test screen is reached, it should be possible to save the maximum number of points, but not to 99,000 (example: "Upgradation programming-to-test"), and then, if the number of credits can be determined by pressing the "Maximum number of credits" button. The maximum number of points to be reached is now set to be 99.
'threshold' means the percentage to be reached to move to the next pass.
'Time limit' means the release of additional Sparx
'Difficulty' means the degree of difficulty of the game
'Pulling tone': at "0", no sound when in standstill
For "1" sound also in stand mode (animation tone) "table model": for "0" stand mode
for "1" tableware
The points and initials of the player, including the next 10 point values, are shown. These values are used to match the highscores selected on the previous display (set from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets up the initials of the QIX standard. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display. The "Total Score" button can set to 0 minutes. Pressing the "Up" switch can set the Minutes Minutes to 0 minutes. The following are recorded: total number of minutes credited: total number of credits paid out. If the total number is not reached at 0 minutes. The total number of credits won from 100 000 coins earned on the previous display (set from "back").
High Score: The number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button sets the values to 0. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display.
Flip slot programming / standard coin setting This indicator allows the flipper to select a standard coin setting or program another setting.
In case of a default setting, the programming is selected by pressing the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digits change. If the right setting is achieved by pressing the 'Test' button the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not correspond to the default setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the 'Sub-Test' switch. After a single pressing the upper setting number is set to 0, meaning that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can decrease his coin setup minima by selecting a setting that matches the value of his/her weighted coins and the value of the coins closely matching the values. The size values are changed when changing the numerical value. When the test is achieved by pressing the "Sub-Test" button the value is set at "SIMMONYCoin Upgrade" ("SM" - "SIMMONYCoinUpgrade") and the required amount can be reduced before the minimum amount is used to increase a certain number of units.
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM in which all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates a battery failure or error.
Error and settings
Testing method: Begin by pressing the "Subtest" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can start. Tests and settings can be entered for each program display, pressing the "Test" button will show the next program each time. If a duration test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the Auto Test mode. Under this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it switches off. When the "Open Door to Coin Test" (money to be checked) appears, the program must be removed from the control panel. This is 1 J-19 - 1 J-2 (RAM / memory = 19 CM/s)
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each Video ROM, and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a discrepancy, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is erroneous, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be exchanged. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be entered as Banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's.
The Communications RAM test determines the reliability of memory that is shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the latch is holding on with the display, a fault has been detected. If the Communications RAM's failed during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or a fault in the data board. To locate the fault, remove data board from P6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Fault in U3, U4 or related circuits.
The video board is CMOS RAM.
After entering values into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the communications RAM. If the test is passed, all the memory slots are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the display among others, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing pre-determined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed for correctness when retrieving. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM).The display RAM is tested by inscribing a pattern on each side.The results of these entries are compared with the original pattern.Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will show the faulty RAM.If a display RAM is failing, identify the problem and replace the RAM.If this error diagnosis shows no RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), indicates that the next test will be started (data hardware).The connection to the data processor must be available and it must be functional.
Unfortunately, disappointed.
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star # 1. The second one is that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable sewing defects. BUT I was probably expecting too much, because the disappointment was even greater. I had orientated myself according to the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Because it should be so narrow and I didn't want to fight in an S or M at my height... In the end it would have fit from the length and from the hip... the rest I could swim. Moreover, the lining came across one already when opening the package and was distributed everywhere. Just damages..:
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is very excited about it. She wears the 158 and you fit the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly continue to wear it next year. We can recommend an order.
High quality
I opted for the rubber c because I always work with wood on the hoist and that's not optimal. Unfortunately I measured too much and the upholstery doesn't fit completely. What is my mistake. Then I made a small change so that it fits. The upholstery seems very strong and you don't damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without any problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would immediately buy it again.
Too big for under a year.
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year old. Because the area for masticating is much too large for the little mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months old we found him again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite on anything with his few teeth already. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not good enough / Unfortunately decreases
I was perhaps blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. I want to inform you that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro. I already have one very large (for equipment storage) and a rather small one with the most important, everyday things that are always taken. Because I just bought myself the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. I have bought this backpack for a really very reasonable price (barely 29 EUR), and actually was very proud of this purchase, although I have read many of the reviews in advance. When my backpack came yesterday, the following statement made me a lot thinner: the backpack is not bad for luggage with a high price, but you cannot tell the bag with a good price, that it is good for luggage! And even with the backpack in one hand, I was able to take my money back to another, which is not as much for the purchase of the products, but it is also not much better. However, the backpack does not have to be as much expensive as my own, because there are not many people who could afford to buy such products.
Unfortunately, disappointed with the third part.
So far I had liked the Electric series by E.L. Todd most, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. The part deals all the time with the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I thought it was unnecessary to dragged out the whole time. Taylor has been enthusiastic about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and then with every fight he is a little child and gets off at?! At the same time, there were discrepancies in my intuition, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor, ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand up to him and tried to convince Taylor ex that he could not do without him and save himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and struggled against the stress and I hope that Taylor will have come out and read the last part of this series pretty much at once and also, I think, I had heard about the final part of the story.
Man destroys everything, knows nothing and does not learn anything! First of all: the film is sooo not bad at present as many write. Naturally, of course, the story is totally constructed, and conceived again and again following the same schema F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same too: Man destroys everything and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! Often in the film I just thought (and that even though I know that it is only a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot tears in your eyes. The film Jurassic World has been made really well. Only it is a pity that my film has a humanity behind the stars and is not good, even though the message is always from the inside, a film that is consistently and consistently excellent, but we have made the latest film because the environment and the same, arrogant and rebellious animal. But, unfortunately, according to our last Ship of Ship, they would have been made to destroy our planet.
A silent and sensitive film.
Some here are waiting for a movie a la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is first and foremost "French" - it is quiet, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and it makes you cry - if you engage in it and you don't expect anything that it doesn't want to be.
The problem
It tastes like Quench from the nineties, because of orange, but it doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuing the diarrhea remains for a week. It should be noted that for the smaller pack size only 2 stars (unfortunately not seen until late) were given, for the larger full 5? This is very strange!
awful smell and poor result! I dyed my blond hair in October with an intensive dyeing in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I used the product twice. The first time I immediately noticed that it stank terribly! However, there was a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not obtained the desired result, I used it, as stated in the instructions, and with not satisfactory result, once more. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked worse on the first try. What was the worst of all, it was still dark after weeks of application. I washed my hair as often as I could, just didn't change the smell.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the pills for a long time now and always take one pill every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of work, too little exercise and also a long additional illness. So I wanted to give my immune system a jump not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great, as you also have to consider how long you can take the pills. Absolutely recommendable.
function not quite perfect!!! after 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross faults which I find very troublesome: 1) The cover has problems with time to "connect" with the mobile phone. This means that it will not charge even after the "Power On / Off" button is pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the cover and reinstall it, you will solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this will lead to a new flaw. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the cover is so worn that it will detach from the case, so I almost lost it several times. Although there are not many deficiencies, I find with a battery case that it works just for its function for over 30€ since I have disposed of the product.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good rating came about. This is actually a washcloth which is a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself a lot more of these towels. It is also very, very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately, I can no longer exchange it. I'm disappointed, and I can't recommend it from my side. The price of these towels is greatly overpriced. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a free gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the onforu works great, is waterproof (my shcon fell in the shower), it produces bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... Suction valve naturally you have to water, otherwise it will fall away... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes... what I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. That said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into higher frequencies. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loud while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the frequency are almost hurting the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough. My bass speaker, of course, has not reproduced sound as well as I expected, but now I feel that the bass resonance is really annoying, but what is the difference between them is that it is not very well reproduced.
very bad
The paint was broken in a few places and if you just went through it by hand the paint just got lost in some places. We wanted to get them out free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately they were our cost. They were only going to exchange the damaged parts but like both the dresser was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all that for us and sent the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money.
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The items are delivered to you, which you have to stick together by yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. The postman stuffed the product right into my letter box, so some of the templates were damaged. I did not complain, because I urgently needed this product. The supplied glue hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not get hard. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the glue material does not dry up (at least it was still not dry for 5 days after gluing), it is necessary to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are high in the end and I would not use a lot of money to spend on a high-end product, but would make money.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not that clear. + Magnetic closure + nice look + stable when built + shelf board can be positioned as you wish
- Doors pop by magnets (you might be able to offset with rubber cups) - some places not clean
- the doubles supplied are much too small and wobbly (I did not have any others and since there was no goblet in the house, I stuck them with homemade glue) - the brackets for the inlay floor wobble a little (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it did not look so good and had such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Furthermore, I also find it a little too expensive for it.
I like the coffee, but...
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). Even the additional plastic waste (packed separately, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects full points soon.
It's my alarm clock.
The alarm clock was quick to come on and everything is easy to set. But: the natural noises sound awful and extremely loud. I also couldn't mute them. Probably a defect, supposedly it is possible. The softest radio setting was too loud for me so I fall out of bed right away. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the walls with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. But then when it was time to turn my face to it and the sunrise simulation started, it immediately struck me. The bright colors and also the color change were nice, unfortunately you can't colour the light. I found that it had a good battery so it didn't go out at one hour, so I had to reinstate the time of the wake.
Light super, processing not enough
I replaced four lamps in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without a cover - instead a board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 received" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have handled this neatly and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - thus far the only reason for a 2 star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and uniformly illuminated. The light is more in cold white. It should be perfect for floors, workshops, bathrooms, kitchens, etc. I would like to personally evaluate the housing to be warmer with the help of Durchaus Light. I am very happy to compare it with a 100 good old birch lamps, and I can also try and get a positive answer quickly on all the other questions. However, I think I will be able to answer this quickly.
That's great.
I've received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy, and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have holes in the handle to be able to hang them. ** The soft silicone doesn't scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical for use on coated pans. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 °F. ** They don't carry heat either and can be touched directly. ** However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone.
B goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime delivery easily tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked faucet and tested all the parts.In the process we discovered that the part had already been built before. On all the assembly parts we had to detect significant scratches, erosion. The screws / connections of the pipes were all damaged. Despite this, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chrome faucet itself there are scratch marks / flakes. This part has probably been delivered already and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build it in the basin in the cellar because there is one no matter how it looks. Imprudent order; never order such goods via amazon again but we prefer to give more from the original product in our shop, just so that customers will be frightened!
The product itself is excellent, but the external sensor is broken after 6 months
Basically I am very happy with this product. Installation was very simple and the phone width is also very good, there are no problems with transmitting from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be mounted on the wall or mounted as a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. However, the thermometer still seems intact, here plausible values are still shown. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is quite right because the extremely high humidity of the air is always shown on the outside. It's a pity that the device is fixed outside at one place and this is the reason why I only gave this product two stars.
Strong mower with a weak fishing basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt of the stand is still going through the Republic today with Hermes, unable to find its way back to me or to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a spare delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly at me and made a good impression. The engine is powerful and the result is a nice cross-section. The volume is not exactly impressive low, but ok. Unfortunately the catch basket is a big problem. For one, it is only top and bottom of hard plastic and in between of fabric. If you fully remove it only for a short time, it will, of course, be crushed and parts of the contents will fall out. It is very bad, but actually the practical filling level is half an inch already eaten full. I think it would be unsuccessful to fully remove a small piece of material through the design of the basket, so, if this is not so bad, then it will not be very good for the large size of the cut, but not always for the use of large parts, and I would have to reconsider.
Good equipment for surveillance
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate through the app. Very good is the included insertable sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is built solid. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to spare the battery are displayed only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be locked quite dimly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again even when you put it in the router. The batteries have to be removed and reconnected after a short break. If the battery is lost, then the alarm should work again.
This is a 3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to level the hotbed properly. The right rear fixing screw is fully engaged, although the hotbed is still too high, and on the right the screw practically falls out because it is not at all engaged, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods hold the car straight, as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what to do because it is impossible to print something this way. For the construction: The construction was fairly trouble-free, I could only show how to lay the cables because you would have to reposition them several times, which is very stressful. I wrote to support, too, but after a week of waiting I still didn't receive an answer. Sorry, I don't have a hat. I'm not expecting anything either.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
Unfortunately my old slide failed to produce the necessary results after many years of use, so I had to buy a new one. This one gives a very robust impression, and after several test measurements it is just as accurate. It comes with two batteries, so that it can be launched immediately. The packaging of the slide is simple, but it fulfills its purpose completely. Otherwise, the slide leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full credit, and I think it will last at least as long as the old slide. From now on there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell of food
bought the bracelet and for the time being I have not worn it, because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day it is not gone even though it was constantly "ventilated". After it was no longer possible to return, I have disposed of it.
For the price, okay
The stars and spheres on this chain are a little too big for me personally, so it looks very solid. The bigger spheres are free to move, which I like very much. However, the chain is very easy to handle, so I've already torn the closure off twice. So far I've been able to repair it over and over again, but I don't think this will last well for very long. But for the low price you simply cannot expect anything of high quality.
What a beautiful piece of jewellery.
A beautifully made band and the simple lock actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't get up, amazing! I rubbed it in with some leather care, making it a little softer and more supple. Just: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the lock is made of steel!
Alas! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that this is used goods. The base station was in order. Now about the function: connect only after some tinkering.... follow the instructions it does not work at all, until after I have removed a battery from the base station again and had reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour, the connection was lost, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also the display of the three stations was very different! That was not so useful for me!
Damage caused by transport
Hi, I had this garden pump once, unfortunately after three and a half years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted away. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew that the suction line and drainage connections would be suitable. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and the current pump would fulfill its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the air-tight compartment was broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend that the pump in the future be packed a little better than using a thin-walled board. I kept the pump however, as described above, despite the fact that I urgently needed the pump and the rust material inside the pump so it did not affect the performance of the pump.
If only one could have thought better, since I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than to run around all the time with a large bundle of keys. In the beginning everything went very well. But then the paint wore out quite quickly and the screws had to be pulled again and again. Good, this works with a penny, but only with a penny. I have not found a suitable slot screwdriver that would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now, to come to the most important thing of the whole thing: the fastening of the key. The beauty of this is that you can put the screw through the different parts, the screw on different sizes or lengths, but then the whole thing should have screwed up, but then you can take another to bring the whole thing back together. It is possible to put the key together again, but it is uncomfortable for me, and then, the final thing: once all the screws are removed, you will never be able to balance it with the whole thing.
Not fully conform to the dimensions specified
Easy-to-use zippers, the material looks sturdy and everything is in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after the first use. At first I can say that the height is lower than specified. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there for example for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly in the case - as usual. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag there were still two smaller bags / bags. Not high-quality finished, I wanted to mention this. However, the fact that the cosmetic bag has a different tone and is made of a different material, the bags are expensive, does not bother me personally. Moreover I see the price-performance ratio as being ok.
So there
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas, and now when I wanted to use it again, it didn't, but, it still doesn't work, so the money I could've just dumped directly in the trash.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound on my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are perfectly protected. With them, two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time, and therefore they are very comfortable. The earmuffs are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also, the weight is very low. Recommendation to buy in this price range.
Nice dress.
Very nice dress that wears well on most occasions.. the price/performance matches exactly, especially since I bought it during the flash sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (which you would have recommended). I wish the cut wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could tolerate a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper sleeves as the model in the picture). But overall it's a nice dress for many occasions.
It's all over. It can't get any worse. I really and truly didn't expect this junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It's assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. However, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually run, Blu-rays are detected to an unreliable maximum. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes a squeaking noise you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a couple of minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing is detected or it is finally detected. But in no case should you ever push a button or pause during a chapter or alter the sound during the movie, just as, of course, a Blu-ray Disc does not contain any additional cost-free software or if it comes with a Blu-ray Disc, you cannot change the sound immediately.
it does what it's supposed to but it's not pretty. first of all I would like to point out that these two USB ports are actually quite an eyesore, because only one port that faces upwards is a USB port. the other plug is just there for charging any devices there and so relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually need a second port and if I only needed a tiny extension, I surely wouldn't have bought these shabby lumps with gold plugs. but aside from the look and my miscalculation, the extension performs its service very reliably. and due to the weight of the plug, the built in USB stick doesn't simply extend around like the ones with a normal extension, which is fine. but my real mistake is that it keeps in tight place. (laughs)
Small but oho! I bought this product so that on my iPad (Pro) I can connect an audio output and a display. With IOS 12 you can now also pass data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back already, could not regretfully this. Practically it is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Audio is delivered via HDMI. What I use my PlayStation P for: There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and has a magnetic support. My shell does not fit with the adapter. Well also keeps the case from contact and therefore... Everything is very stable and expensive, however, because something in the middle is completely wireless. All the aluminum is still very much justified in one piece. Performance in one small price.
Any quantity of power
It runs for months with no problems. It's not light or quiet, but it gives a lot of power. I find the temperature setting to be a little too cool, so I'm always on level two. It's also been dropped on the floor many times and has survived well. And I also like the simplicity of its design. Competitors like to look like space ships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with a weak battery.
We've been using the Tracker for about six months and are positively surprised in live mode, the positioning feels to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters which is not disturbing. I would buy it at any time. But what would be great, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 days. Here would be a great solution that would last 7-14 days. While there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too large for our taste, so the battery would not last with us and we also find it inconvenient to change it every day. You should not deal with the dog with his necklace :-) The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life cycle decreases more and more. Although my son only wears them in exercise class, after a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. The last pair was of similarly ordinary use, they didn't last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately that was not true. The shoes are more expensive trash and totally not to recommend.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after five years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly made at first glance. They are as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, you may not see any difference, but at second glance you notice the edges are poorly made, and the restraint on the heel is quite loose, and very likely will not last five years like mine. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good.
Since there are hardly any reviews yet to read, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and I would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it anyway out of the goodness of my heart. As part of the delivery, the mattresses and an automotive air pump were included. Regarding the mattress, I tested it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hoped that it would not reappear. In the inflated condition, a direct delivery test was performed. It lays well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace the hard bed, but for the own days at the event it is very pure of luxury. Since the mattress fits miraculously into the back seat of my car. Before we had the pumps, it fits perfectly with my car.
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar from me gets only two stars.:( first, for quick shipping; second, for the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open by the lapidary processing directly on day one on multiple doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the rest of the pieces accordingly because it was almost already satisfactory to him. The parts often come out wrong which often means you have to rebuild the car again in order to fix the parts. After the car is completely assembled, the parts fall out while playing. (The front decoration is the most important. This one also fits very poorly.) I would not buy this calendar anymore and recommend it to anyone.
a real drone
I am excited about the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. Inside it flies very well and the five-minute flight time is usually completely adequate. The fact that hair becomes trapped in it and the drone breaks very quickly I did not expect anything different at this price, but falling from the ceiling to the ground, whether tile or carpet, is not a problem. In case of questions, a nice contact.
game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play at all, which is a disgrace. Since then the computer is constantly hanging, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails on the battery life.
I was looking forward to the watch very much. Design and looks great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Three big hooks: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, laid only on the drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery if not used. Got many news in the day, the battery was already in the midday / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, not useful for me. Very bad.
Noble cover with restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 +, you absolutely should wear a case. I recently liked case where you can also place the credit card. This is provided by the case here. If you insert cards in all 3 boxes, it becomes too much, then the cover is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. The phone is unlike many other cases around, only at the connections are gaps. Otherwise, you can easily control the single-board and silencer on the side through the case. The disadvantage is that even on QI boxes it is not possible, through the thickness of the case, to charge the phone. You can only charge the phone well from the case. It does not work as well as other accessories.
a high quality casing with glass foil
Strong case with a proper armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily pulled up. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good purchase.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism is caused by the transport of fetal cells through the placenta to the maternal circulation during pregnancy and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism may lead to SSc in some patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like response.
Autologous blood sampling prior to elective surgery helps reduce perioperative risk, but may itself cause side effects.

Still disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not develop until adulthood, at which time it is called "adult-onset Still's disease".
The diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthema, joint discomfort, febrile and leukocytosis, liver dysfunction, sore throat without evidence of infection, enlarged lymph nodes or spleen, and absence of titers for rheumatic factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two long-ill adult patients whose skin symptoms led to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
Mr. Still's exanthem is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply limited maculae, which are very volatile.
A slight friction in the exanthema groove can cause erythematous Kobner phenomena which, as we described for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthema.

The recommendations of the Working Group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarised below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children represent a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective treatment and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Infections caused by a wide range of pathogens are particularly likely, with the usual bacterial pathogens being Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegalovirus (CMV), fungi, tuberculosis bacteria and respiratory viruses.
However, in 25-30% of cases, the respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
A medical history, chest X-rays, and blood tests are often of little help in establishing a diagnosis.
However, analysis of material from the respiratory system frequently leads to the diagnosis of:
Nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum (possibly induced by cooking salt inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
The flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage provides diagnostic clarity in 60-80%. The remaining cases must be diagnosed at an appropriate clinic, by a mostly open lung biopsy.
The majority of those affected are young to middle-aged women.
In the German-speaking world, this disease has not yet been mentioned in the literature.
We are describing a 60-year-old patient today with the typical picture of an IMDE (type I).
The special interest of this case study lies in the fact that there is no dependency on light, as has also been demonstrated by the absence of deterioration under PUVA therapy.
IMDE is likely to be a special disease in the family of elastolytic diseases in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Using pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures, treated by the Universal Spine System, we performed a planimeter evaluation of the spinal canal.
The aim was to test the efficiency of direct reposition of stenosing back edge fragments under intraoperative sonographic control.
51 %) than in those without neurological disorders (reduction in ASP:
The spinal canal is wider below L1 than between Th 11 and L1 and thus tolerates greater constriction.
In fractures without neurological breakdown, the fragment replacement promises to avoid delayed damage to the spinal cord in terms of myelopathy and claudication spinalis.
A preliminary investigation should clarify if there is evidence of ultrasons analgesia at the prescribed power density (LD) in patients with non-radical back pain under serial administration.
A review of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult to repair mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, whereas simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can be successfully treated using monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
An indicator for a suitable differential indication between the two therapeutic approaches appears to be the collection of preoperative and intraoperative parameters which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and which additionally constitute a key value for the classification of trauma.
However, with only seven individual parameters, such as the mandibular fracture score, there are already so many combinations of the descriptors of lower jaw fracture that all previous studies, with their small number of cases, can at best provide a rough indicative difference.
Until a prospective multicenter study is available which may support the decision regarding the choice of osteosynthesis method, in the fluid range between " simple " and " severe" fracture, preference should be given to functionally stable compression osteosynthesis, with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique which allows comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and underrepresentations of DNA sections.
In order to make quantitative and reproducible statements on genetic aberrations, software has been developed that allows the objective detection of the location and nature of the changes.
The result is shown in the form of a CGH summary caryogram, which documents the genetic changes as colour-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these studies is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum-karygrams, and thus to obtain a genetic characterization of tumours which complements the morphological description.
Surgical procedures can be precisely planned and simulated using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of anatomical bone structures created from a patient's tomography data.
Computer navigation systems or robotic systems may provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of planned activities, as well as in spatial orientation at the operating site.
After more than 30 years of successful centralisation of laboratory analysis, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, whole blood testing and the reduction of lab analyses are today leading to a renewed decentralisation in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed near the patient outside central or decentralised laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need to use only small sample sizes.
These benefits are often highlighted, but are not associated with any clear clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/ or maintenance of analytical equipment by untrained station personnel, lack or absence of calibration and/ or quality control, cost of storing several devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation, and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also apparent.
The authors believe that the decision to establish a POCT should be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure the usefulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.) the spectrum of parameters of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analyte required for this should be:
Haemoglobin or haematocrit, activated whole blood clotting time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and adherence to safety aspects are necessary.
Rapid and ultra-rapid imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast media and thermosensitive contrast media are discussed.
The range of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MRI.
Interventional MRI is still in the early stages of development.
MR imaging may have a significant value in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
In patients with chronic renal failure, characteristic skeletal changes occur.
The aim of the present studies was to fully record the changes in the bone mass of the vertebral column following long term haemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Of 9 post-mortem cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, complete spinal examinations were performed.
A newly developed preparation technique allows for the combined two and three-dimensional analysis, so that in addition to the histological image the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analysed directly.
Measurements were made of vertebral body height (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and the intertrabecular junction (TBPf).
The spine deformity index (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in the case of ROP types I and II despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) within the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control group.
But the plateau curve from HWS to LWS is 5% lower for the ROPs.
The BV/ TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding pelvic combiopsy.
Those with longer haemodialysis had higher BV/TV values regardless of age and sex.
Normal BV/TV is not equivalent to physiological networking of spongiasa and functional statics.
The three dimensional analysis in ROP results in a much greater restructuring of architecture compared to the controls than can be deduced on the 2-D cut planes and trabecular bone volumes.
The findings highlight the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiform architecture in patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis.
In 1700, French surgeon Alexandre de Littré first described a form of inguinal hernia that, by its course and the section found by Littré himself, did not correspond to what was known before.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this sagging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before that, Richter described the intestinal fracture in a scientific paper on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
The history of this form of hernia is elaborated on the basis of a case report.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the disease picture received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disturbance is unknown.
A patient is presented with the typical features of Asperger's syndrome, with concomitant epilepsy and internal abnormalities.
Potential co-morbidities of Asperger' s syndrome, such as epilepsy, are discussed alongside the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic approach.
Yersinia infections usually manifest in childhood as febrile gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
An infant with Yersinia infection manifested as tumour-like lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with prolonged persistence has been reported.
The diagnosis was made by repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer Yersinia membrane proteins.
It was only after treatment with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks that all clinical findings returned to normal.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was studied prospectively in 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The question has been raised as to what conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and what consequences can result from these findings.
The study showed that a high percentage of pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
The same applies if an autopsy was unable to determine the cause of death.
At this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented that demonstrated the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for the future of tissue transplantation.
A 58-year-old patient developed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever in the early postoperative phase following a vaginal hysterectomy and subsequently developed a picture of septic shock.
In addition, Staphylococcus epidermidis was detected in this preserved blood, the second Propionibacterium acnes.
The source of contamination of the cans could not be identified.
It has become apparent that autologous haemotherapy also has a considerable risk of infection and that the re-transfusion of one's own blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal infections in the renal pelvis are an uncommon manifestation of a serious infection by Candida albicans.
We describe an adult newborn with VACTERL association who, following candidasepsis, developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis leading to hydronephrosis with onset of posterior renal failure.
Normalisation of excretion was obtained on antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine and direct rinsing with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy.
With the increase in the frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, the possibility of bezovaria should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to initiate early and effective therapy.
High dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective treatment for acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
It has since been found that some patients do not respond to or respond insufficiently to this therapy.
The present retrospective study compared two groups of 20 responders and 20 non-responders.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the following parameters:
Skin type, minimal erythematous dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in the peripheral blood.
In contrast, non-responders had significantly higher atopy score, increased total IgE and specific IgE titres than responders.
In addition, a comparative greater prevalence of highly pathogenic skin Staphylococcus aureus and intestinal Candida albicans was observed in the non-responders.
These findings indicate that high dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterised by a particularly severe atopy syndrome on the one hand and by complicated superinfections on the other.
The latter finding suggests that a combination of high dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal therapy may be of benefit for these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare form of lupus erythematosus.
The association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is demonstrated by two case studies.
Clinically, subcutaneous articular and plate-like infiltrates are present, which may lead to ulceration and scarring.
Histologically, there is lobular paniculitis.
Another diagnostic indication is a positive direct immunofluorescence test (lupica test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal border and vessels.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance as lupus erythematosus profundus may precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis existing for more than 45 years.
Patient died with clinical signs of cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicological assay.
The pathogenesis and the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic effects of chloroquine are presented.
In the last 5-7 years there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatments for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarises the results of experimental and clinical studies on the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of advances in medicine, more and more patients are being operated on with preexisting disease, in old age, with reduced cardiac pumping function, following previous heart surgery, and in emergency conditions.
This requires a risk stratification, which divides the operational risk into "low", "medium" and "high" types.
Pre, intra and postoperative patient, structural and treatment related factors can be distinguished.
Based on this prognosis, the perioperative course can be optimized through individualized, preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative, multiprofessional and interdisciplinary organized management.
Patients have an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumours, mainly spinaliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
We are reporting on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanoma, a spinal cancer, and a lymph node metastasis of malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complement analysis which resulted in assignment to complement group D.
Occasionally, patients with years of untreated, temporally exulsified malignancies on the chest, thoracic wall, and/ or abdominal liner may present to the plastic surgeon the need for large defect coverages after tumour resection.
The use of silver-containing activated carbon film (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn) avoided infection by replacing the side with an omentum plastic in the resection of an extended basal cell.
After secondary mesh burial, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable hull wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The 2000 healthcare reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German healthcare system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and of registered doctors for outpatient care are not affected.
The hospital budget remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogues will be required for outpatient operations which cannot be performed in hospital.
The quality assurance obligation is specified and strengthened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiorgan failure is a complex immunological process influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurring systemically, and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-8 and the inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and systemically.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may also ultimately lead to a better understanding of the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumours are usually nonspecific.
X-rays often show only lightening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radio opacities.
Root-tip resorptions may be another important finding.
After a short historical outline, the current state of knowledge for each type is briefly outlined based on the currently valid WHO classification.
This then develops our current treatment approach, in which all 22 tumour entities are divided into a total of four groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumours.
Generalized happiness disorder (GHD) is a mental disorder often of late diagnosis, characterized by a uniformity in emotional experience in the face of circumstances such as a depressive mood, despair, great anxiety, self-incrimination or aggression against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person and prevent adverse longterm consequences for individuals and society.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life threatening disease requiring rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment.
Despite effective antibacterial antibiotics, the mortality rate has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapeutic regimen that focuses on the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimise subsequent neurological damage and preserve the patient's life.
This article describes the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy, with particular attention to molecular pathophysiological processes in CNS inflammation.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/ Denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly useful in distinguishing bone lesions from neighbouring anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the complex details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows the accurate characterization of pathologies including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
Without knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is virtually impossible.
The majority of the current oral IC studies have not been randomized, double-blind, or placebo controlled, and do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
Therefore, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple pleasant papules on his back after suffering a severe sunburn.
Clinical and histopathological studies show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolitic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis, seborrheic keratoses or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective horning.
Epidermolitic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be distinguished from severe congenital corneal disorders exhibiting the same histological phenomenon as epidermolitic hyperkeratosis.
In order to reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, anti-fibrinolytic agents are now commonly used in extracorporeal circulation (ECC) procedures in cardiac anaesthesia.
However, there are concerns about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECG should be compared.
It describes the diagnostic imaging of MMS arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient.
The involvement of the manubrium (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional x-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manic-depressive angio-arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized for endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.
This retrospective study should examine the functional outcomes of the surgical treatment.
In his childhood, Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of pseudologia phantastica.
The determining factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this paper.
The aim is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late stage of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis and the therapeutic effect depending on the HLA B27 characteristic.
The present study looks at the history of a patient with severe OCD since the age of 14.
It is not a separate obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a form of schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
In the one-year medical history of treatment with clozapine in cases of exacerbated schizophrenic symptoms at the age of 31, no psychotic symptoms or significant compulsive symptoms were observed.
While the literature increasingly refers to OCD symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication mostly in the indications range of chronic schizophrenic psychosis, this article describes as far as the author is aware, the rare case of clozapine improvement of OCD symptoms in schizophrenia.
The importance of differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed by the example of the individual case.
The isomorphic stimuli effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin response to non-specific skin stimuli.
The triggering of such a Koebner phenomenon is reported in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing at values greater than 0.055 J/cm2.
A case is described of a 28-year-old patient who developed new psoriasis clusters in the viral blossoms after a varicella infection.
As the subject was planning to spend several months in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was for the exclusion of oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, the question of genetic risk factors for developing rheumatic disease, and the question of whether rheumatic factors may occur as a reaction to vaccination;
Initial experience and results are reported with 13 simultaneous reconstructions of major head and neck complex defects involving 8 microvascularly anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major islet lobes.
There was no complete loss of the lobe in any case.
The free forearm graft produced better functional and aesthetic results, but the surgery required for reconstruction was relatively long.
Disadvantages of the Pectoralis major flap are mainly the poor modellability and a limited rotational radius.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of free microvascular grafting would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli which may cause specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, characterised by increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This allows circulating immune cells to adhere to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been viewed in the past mainly as a precondition for the development of inflammatory reactions, evidence has recently emerged that exogenous factors can transform endothelial cells into an inflammatory state without the mediation of cytokines.
For example, endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, and by ultraviolet and ionising radiation or mechanical shear forces.
Endothelial cells are thus not only subject to the control of intrinsic mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.) but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin stimuli.
Treatment-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, particularly after combined cataract/ glaucoma operations, are an indication for the topical administration of rTPA.
We report on our findings.
The report presents a case of benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumour of the lymph node, described for the first time five years ago and not yet documented in the German language literature.
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
Its diagnostic criteria include, in addition to the structure of myofibroblast cells arranged in a palisading way (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin), hemorrhagic areas accentuated to the periphery and the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumour identity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasia.
The increased strength of two parallel inner rails reduced obstruction and kinking and produced a reduction in the congestion of the proximal cavity system.
This technique also permits, in addition to the urine flow within the rails, an increased flow between the rails, which is considered to be a crucial mechanism of urine passage in situated urethral striations.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression where insertion of a singular internal sphincter does not adequately regrow ectasy in the anterior intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral sphincters should be considered as a technically simple, low-complexity therapeutic alternative that may save some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive procedures.
Of the minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc events (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/ APLD/ laser decompression/ chemonucleolysis), the intradiscal application of chymopapain is the technique with the longest clinical experience and duration.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
In the case of careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - especially allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis is an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy, which closes the therapeutic window between conservative treatment and open surgery.
The value of diuresis sonography compared to the diuresis nephrogram ('gold standard') in children with urinary tract disorders should be studied in a prospective study.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.
The method has been developed and modified over the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same objective:
radical tumour removal while preserving the non-infected surrounding tissue.
However, there are essential differences in the technique of tumour excision, the mounting of the histological sections and the histological evaluation of the preparation.
A methodological inventory is made and the differences and advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
Marjolin ulcer is characterised by a more aggressive behaviour compared to other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65- year-old patient with a lesion in the back of his right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect following correspondingly wide local excision was covered by a retrograde A. radialis flap.
Spinal cord opioids provide good analgesia for a wide range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic adverse reactions than with epidural administration of local anaesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anaesthetics in postoperative pain management, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCA), will be demonstrated.
Several advantages over the epidural route have been attributed to the intrathecal route.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids is dependent on different forms of administration.
There is no clinical advantage of a thorical over a lumbar injection with respect to the quality of analgesia, serious adverse events, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative lung function.
However, there is some evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics and/or opioids is the first choice for patients at high preoperative risk and is cost effective.
Through the cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) and the German Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutane tests are collected centrally at the participating centres in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively, separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, perfume mix, perubalsam and thiomersal were the most common reactions;
For 1995, differentiated lists of allergens were also compiled for defined patient groups (by sex, age, eczema location, geographical region, occupation, sensitisation) and specific questions.
The percentage of men who responded positively to nickel, perfume mix, and balsamic ointment was much lower than that of women.
Younger patients were more likely to respond to thimerosal, older patients to external medicine.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in hand eczema patients.
In nickel and fragrance allergy sufferers, there were higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not evident.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of diagnosis and prevention of contact allergies.
Approximately 95% of all persons infected (in contact) with M. leprae do not develop outbreaks of the disease.
The clinical manifestation is determined less by the direct effects of bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
This review article considers current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment, and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently a large number of studies have been presented on the quantitative study of the vortex phenomenon in the chamber water (KW) by means of laser vortex measurements.
For example, by measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS compared with the vortex intensity in the HF for wavelengths of different localization, it is to be investigated to what extent the vortex rise is actually caused by a BKS disturbance in each case.
The present experimental study investigates the effect of acamprosat, a glutamate modulator, and lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on neurological deficits after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has so far failed.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the basic problems of nerve regeneration.
The strong defensive reaction to foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units which are vital for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal test results cannot stand up to clinical review because poor regenerative performance may occur in the animal test despite an impaired regeneration pathway.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their late effects is the greatest gynaecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two thirds of HIV-infected women developed symptoms of genitourinary infections, and one third developed cervical dysplasia.
One quarter had chronic symptoms and late sequelae of ascending genital infections.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other opportunistic infections typical of AIDS and usually occurs prior to the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhoea (17%) or hypermenorrhoea were more frequently observed.
The main complications in pregnancy are preterm labour (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth.
Progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy has not been observed.
Risks for peripartal transmission to foetuses include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as premature delivery, early labor, amniotic fluid infection, duration of bladder rupture and labour, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternal fetal HIV-1 transmission can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6- 8%), by a primary low contamination cesarean delivery (4- 6%), and most successfully by primary c-section and concomitant prenatal, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells are central to initiating the immune response because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical trials in patients with resistant melanoma and lymphoma indicate that dendritic cells sensitised to tumour antigens in vitro can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Because of the limited base data on the presence and function of dendritic cells in tumour tissue for laryngeal carcinoma, this study examined the immunohistological localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, in squamous cell carcinomas of the supra-glottis and the glottis.
The results show that in contrast to T lymphocytes, dendritic cells are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
Comparisons with the clinical parameters indicate that the patients with a low number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma (< 100/ cells/ mm2) had the lowest post-operative survival (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favourable prognostic factor of the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered to be a significant factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure.
In addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two metabolic pathways for transulfurization (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were identified in the present study in patients with renal insufficiency.
We're reporting two cases of feline scratch disease.
This is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
Suspect diagnosis is based on history of cat scratches and the typical findings of lymph node swelling at the site of the primary lesion.
In order to obtain an insight into the frequency and clinical status of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of patients seen between 1984 and 1994 at a university polyclinic or dermatological office on the basis of patient records and, in some cases, through post-examination was carried out.
The incidence of cold urticaria was 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 female, 25 male), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean life expectancy was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean duration of illness was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of patients had atopy and 23.2% had other forms of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests have only been positive in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with most experiencing only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1 - 2 mIU/ day for 2 - 4 weeks, n = 18, or tetracycline 2 g/ day for 2 weeks, n = 10) full remission occurred in 13 patients and improvement in 8.
Spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) over 6.5 years of follow-up.
The surprisingly good treatment success with antibiotic therapy highlights the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, including a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old patient is reported, who presented with primary lumbar pain.
Both laboratory chemically, radiologically and histopathologically the finding was primarily indicative of the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excisions a histological picture of nonspecific inflammation was found.
It was not until the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal that highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was detected histologically.
Chemotherapy was given according to the CHOP regimen and radiotherapy treatment.
Spinal lymphomas should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in the case of progressive disease.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with medial facial fractures and/ or fronto-basal fractures in more than 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures occur in up to 70% of cases through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa.
Different approaches to the treatment of isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and cranial base fractures in mid-face fractures exist.
During the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Oral, Maxillofacial and Facial Surgery Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne.
For the remaining 25 patients with NEO and medial facial fractures without involvement of the cranial base, the repositioning and treatment were provided via a subcranial access route.
47 patients were followed up for up to 4 years and their data were evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for the extracranial and transcranial care of fractures of the ethmoidal bone involving the base of the skull and the central face is presented.
However, there is a high risk of bleeding during and after surgery.
A femoral neck fracture should be treated with surgery in an obese 50-year-old female patient with familial hypophosphataemia and V. a. phlebothrombosis.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation was immediately started with cardiac pressure massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline.
During resuscitation, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In the case of V. a. fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed under continuous cardiac pressure massage.
After 21/4 hours of CPR and 11/2 hours after commencement of lysis, moderately stable haemodynamics could be achieved under continuous, high dose catecholamine administration and volume replacement.
A massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss of coagulopathy.
On the 28th day of resuscitation, the patient was able to be moved from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made based on the clinic, captometry, blood gas analysis, and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were avoided.
In anaesthesia with the novel inhalation anaesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total administered dose is metabolised.
The extent of the resulting serum peaks of inorganic fluoride is determined in particular by the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anaesthetic administered and the solubility of the anaesthetic gas, expressed in terms of its blood gas partition coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane may lead to increased renal complications.
However, no increased renal risk for fluoride exposure was found with sevoflurane in the animal studies, in routine clinical use or with prolonged anaesthesia, or in patients with renal insufficiency.
The recently established low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane, in contrast to enflurane and in particular methoxyflurane, is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 μmol/l, still used in the literature, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane but has no validity in relation to the anaesthesia gases sevoflurane, as well as enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those found, inter alia, following anaesthesia with sevoflurane, are thus to be considered as clinically safe.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence of direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of the macroscopic method of preparation is of fundamental importance for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischaemic heart disease.
The best results are obtained by basic parallel lamellation of the cardiac ventricles, which should be performed after fixation and the querollamellation of any additional decalcified coronary arteries, even if postmortem coronary angiography cannot be performed beforehand.
This process allows for a better understanding and correlation of the distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference, and transmural expansion of infarcts, their age and sequelae and the respective coronary supply area than with the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following blood flow.
At the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occlusive thrombosis can be judged as well as therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in acute cardiac death and short-lived territorial ischemia.
Through systematic collection of transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage may be captured in correlation with coronary morphology and coronary supply.
However, more recent prospective randomised trials show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy does not confer any additional survival advantage after R0 resection.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus, oesophagogastric passage and stomach are not yet conclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumours, no convincing prognostic benefit from preoperative radiation, chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy/ chemotherapy compared to resection alone has been demonstrated in several Phase III studies.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach is only expected with response to pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared with preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radiation and chemotherapy improves response rates, at least for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out in prospective studies in carefully selected patients in specialised centres with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rare condition.
The disease, unusual for childhood, is usually associated only with certain metabolic disorders.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or 'hysterical' symptomatology can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences, such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Non-assimilated memories of trauma are retraumazing and need to be defended by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior, or social "acting".
With this psychodynamic background, we propose a trauma therapy, which implements the experiences of hypnosis and catathymic imaginative psychotherapy.
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the imagination resource-oriented.
The real trauma work is a measured, steady confrontational but minimally retraumatizing, approach to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner consolation and letting go.
The final phase is again about the resource-oriented approach to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record developments in diagnostics and the proportion of multiple disabled students in a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years.
Chronic benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women (pseudotumor cerebri), a venous drainage obstruction is a possible cause.
The extent to which the visus remains stable in diabetic retinopathy after vitrectomy over time has been investigated and the causes and risk factors for deterioration of the visus have been identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by most disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entry point.
After inoculation, HIV can begin to multiply within 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody testing can detect the emergence of HIV infection within four to 12 weeks, and therapy diminishes the antibody response;
The nucleic acid tests allow for detection as from about day 11.
In nearly 100 years of development, countless native, extracorporeal and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favoured autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadruple tendon transplant of the Pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon transplant are of major clinical importance.
With certain limitations, the use of cadaveric grafts is also justified.
The individual grafts show specific differences in biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
A clear superiority of any of the above-mentioned transplants could not be verified in clinical trials.
The selection of grafts should take into account the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
Care for complex ligament injuries and revision requires careful preoperative planning with modified transplant selection, as appropriate.
A rare development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
After 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized malignant tumour developed in the left corner of the mouth.
Histological examination revealed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, and no evidence of a pleomorphic adenoma was detected.
Clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and histological characteristics are discussed in the light of the literature.
Coronary calcium is evidence of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately by electron beam tomography.
Clinical relevance varies depending on whether the lime screening is performed in patients with known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant sub-aspect of coronary heart disease.
This paper presents the frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects in terms of ergometry, and provides guidance for prognostic evaluation and practical conclusions.
We report three patients with a combination of chronic immuno-thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes, respectively.
In the 3 patients, the two conditions were associated with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we observed no case of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immuno-thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus other conditions from the category of autoimmune polytocinopathy type II should be excluded.
Airway support after surgery of the upper respiratory tract may be problematic in certain patients.
Therefore, care should be taken to ensure safe reintubation if required.
Two patients who were reported to have severe intubation difficulties and thus high risk factors for intubation and possibly reintubation in general anaesthesia due to recurrent papillary thyroid cancer or inoperable hypopharynx cancer.
A fibre optically placed endotracheal guide wire was used as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable complementary examinations for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor spread pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their implications for staging and therapy are essential for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive investigations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottis, paraglottis, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity of both methods is less than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumour proliferation.
The very high negative predictive value of the two CT procedures is clinically important as it allows the exclusion of neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumours, both CT and MRI provide valuable indications of possible aetiology, the extent of submucosal growth and the appropriate site of biopsy.
The implantation of cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachycardia.
Patients with end-stage renal failure have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only small numbers of cases in PTCA-mediated myocardial revascularization in patients on chronic dialysis, which suggest an overall high peri-interventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We studied the restenosate levels in 23 patients with end-stage renal failure (17 men, 6 women, middle-aged:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primary successful PTCA, all patients underwent coronary angiography within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic monitoring, 12 patients complained of the recurrence of pectangerous complaints.
Laboratory chemistry showed that the patients had hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/ dl) and hypercholesterolaemia (258 +/- 53 mg/ dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/ dl) and marked increase in fibrinogen levels (481 +/- 114 mg/ dl).
A case of a 64-year-old female patient is described who developed total pelvic instability within one year as a result of a build up of fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings.
A minor pelvic trauma was retrospectively considered as the triggering event.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthritis, the differential diagnosis was firstly focused on the suspicion of a malignant event.
A wide range of conditions are considered to be the cause of hip pain in childhood.
The emphasis is on the inclusion of non-traumatic causes in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand and to avoid the omission of necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Some common but also less common conditions are illustrated by examples.
Iatrogenic rupture of the trochanter major during prosthetic care of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg in the rear access prosthesis implantation could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for traumatic dry burst isolation, which is used here for comparison, even with significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still controversial.
This paper examines the role of design in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are considered using data from quality assurance.
The ZUF-8 examines relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, the further consumption behaviour of patients, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This indicates that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
Furthermore, dissatisfied and satisfied patients differ in their use patterns.
The link between satisfaction and the therapeutic work relationship is in part clear for individual aspects of the employment relationship.
The effects found are relatively large, but in absolute terms they are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction following treatment.
Changes in the aging process of men are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels decline with age, correlations between middle and later life disorders and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due to, inter alia, the methodological limitations of the available studies, the high variability of testosterone levels with age, unclear reference values for older men and various influences (health and behaviour) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with five days of dyspnoea was subjected to pre-lysis imaging following a nuclear medicine indication of a stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
We found a right atrial floating thrombus.
Following acute vital danger, ultra-high-dose short-term streptokinase (UHSK) lysis was initiated with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely cleared and the leg thrombosis was largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years, and most were injured in road traffic accidents.
A single fracture was reported in 50% of patients, and the remaining patients had either associated injuries or polytrauma.
The average length of hospitalization was 17 days and the average length of crutches was 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid course of recovery.
The majority (85%) received treatment without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) patients with open fractures and in only 2 (0.4%) patients with closed fractures, which is within the normal range.
In line with our findings and experience we think that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthetic plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatments.
The extent of remote metastatic diagnosis in head and neck tumours remains controversial.
The present retrospective study assessed the factors influencing the frequency and localization of distant metastasis by using the histories of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases in their lifetime, including 17 cases (1.6%) at the time of primary tumour diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastasis was positively correlated with the initial tumour stage (p< 0.00001) and with the manifestation of local and/or regional recurrence (p< 0.00001) or a second tumour outside the ENT region (p< 0.0005).
In contrast, the parameters "primary tumour localization" and "histopathological tumour grading" had no independent predictive value, but mainly reflected different frequencies of tumour stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases for tumours of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to a chest X-ray.
Advanced diagnosis, including abdomensography, skeletal scintigraphy and/ or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated in locoregionally advanced tumours, recurrent tumours and secondary tumours outside the CNS.
However, the question of the therapeutic consequences should always be considered in each individual case.
This article gives a brief overview of the history of spine surgery from the late 19th century to the present.
Ernst Simmel was one of a small circle of early psychoanalysts who strove with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of a first psychoanalytic polyclinic in 1919 in Berlin and the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloss Tegel") in Germany in 1927.
Furthermore, his rediscovery as a pioneer can also be seen as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions of the trade unions.
He is a credible professional identification character between generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine".
Nevertheless, the highlight of Simmel should not lead to forgetting of the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish origin.
In principle four post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be affected by osteotomies:
Recurrent dislocations and subluxations of the hip, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis and deformities.
The clinical, survey radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is of central importance.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was to meta-analyze all available randomised controlled trials using dexamethasone alone or in combination with other anti-emetics for the prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in a number of systemic diseases.
In some cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term by systemic immunosuppression.
Dysfunction of the vertebral joints leads to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
As the disc injury occurs in more than 80% of cases on the side of compression, a causal relationship must be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the space constraint increases further for the herniated disc.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
The operation, which was developed for malignant changes in the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and has a high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether organ-sparing, duodenal-sparing pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign pancreatic head tumors.
This operation was performed on the patients with little blood and with almost no complications.
At a median follow-up of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were complaint-free, with one patient who had surgery for gastrinoma still showing increased gastrin levels late post-operatively.
Compared with the preoperative functional test, the endocrine and exocrine function was little affected by the surgery.
Thus, in strict indications, benign tumours in the region of the head of the pancreas can be adequately treated by a duodenum-continuing pancreatic head resection, which is sufficiently radical, without complications and without permanent impairment of exocrine and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method in the treatment of symptomatic and/ or prognostically significant bradycardia.
About one in six patients die of sudden cardiac death in the period following pacemaker implantation, primarily due to the progression of the underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become evident that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart may increase the risk of initiating and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Especially in the case of advanced myocardial injury, stimulation-related R-to-T phenomena, "long" sequences, and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, may elicit secondary life-threatening tachyarrhymia.
Given that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding and awareness of the pathological mechanisms involved should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but, most importantly, even safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, is used to select patients suitable for surgical treatment for curative purposes, or to define those carcinogens that will not benefit from surgical intervention and will receive alternative forms of treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (including liver and adrenal glands), abdominal sonography and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological tests for staging bronchial cancer.
For targeted questions, for example, after thoraxvand filtration, and in patients with contrast allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be performed in addition to or as an alternative to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) positron emission tomography for assessing lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/ somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and Thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical relevance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used to stage lung tumours.
Methods currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic molecular MRI contrast agents or tumour receptor-based nuclear medicine techniques, could play an important role in staging bronchial cancer in the future.
Tumor surgeries in the abdomen, retroperitoneum, and pelvis can cause damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs.
As these patients are often of both sexual and reproductive age, prevention of such side effects is of particular importance in tumour therapy.
Erectile dysfunction or ejaculation problems may occur following surgery, radiation therapy or drug therapy of various tumours.
With a thorough understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now largely preventable.
If damage to the corresponding nerve pathways cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required for curative treatment of the tumour, sexual dysfunction is a significant limitation of the quality of life for these patients of a sexually active and also reproductive age.
However, both ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction can be treated with a number of therapeutic modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the throat vessels at different channelling locations.
There is a report of a truck driver who developed atypical hepatic thrombocytopenia (HIT) after having suffered compression trauma of both legs during medication prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin.
in addition to thrombosis, he had a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with increased platelet count with positive antibody to heparin:
Our first patient contact on the sixth day after the accident was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis of the lower left leg and a threatened compartment syndrome, also surgically split on the lower left leg.
After excluding other possible causes of these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin platelet factor-4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the complete picture of an anaphylactic reaction that could be immediately interrupted by administration of cortisone.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, which is otherwise characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin on the cell surface of the platelets.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the various forms of hepatinallergy types I to IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte depletion and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
The basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the second edition of the histologic typing of salivary gland tumours of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991.
The first description goes back to Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumour entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumours of the salivary glands.
The parotid gland is the site of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell carcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumour extirpation with an adequate safety margin and a histologically controllable tumour clearance of all resection margins.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma is currently known to have a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after first manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
The present study has developed a modified animal experimental model of renal xenotransplantation in which the course of a hyperacute rejection response is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs onto rats as recipients using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with spenderaorta or V. cava and ureteral drainage by splinting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of this study was to analyse the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenon grafts.
A total of 24 xenograft procedures were performed and randomized to 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/ kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was observed in the sCR1 group due to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
Histologically, the control group showed mass platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in capillaries and interstitial infiltrates as early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion.
In contrast, sCR1-treated kidney transplants showed a significantly reduced intravascular thromboplast formation and reduced interstitial infiltration after 120 minutes.
The immunohistological study showed a similar decrease in C3 deposition in the glomeruli and interstitium in the treatment group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic operations have been performed in our home, on the gallbladder, stomach, colon, and groin with the robotic arm for optical guidance, controlled by the voice of the surgeon.
The field of vision is determined directly by the operator's commands.
The control of the robotic arm was precise throughout the interventions, speech recognition was accurate, and there were no technical problems.
29 operations could be performed by a single operator as "solo surgery".
For a further 20 operations, only one assistant was used in addition to the operator.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The resolution of vascular complications due to DSA in renal and pancreatic transplants requires invasive surgery in mostly diabetic pre-damaged vessels and the use of iodine-containing contrast media may indicate nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
This is demonstrated by a case of tuberculosis coxitis which was treated in collaboration between the emergency surgery department and the medical clinic in Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic approach using imaging and microbiological methods allows for a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculosis chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the therapeutic outcome and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both as regards local resolution of infection and the functional outcome.
Atrial tachycardia significantly reduces quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is applied in clinical practice without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying this procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using advanced optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in cellular repolarization that favor a disruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms differ in chronic atrial fibrillation from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications from clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary lesions, more frequently than secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
Cases involving a late lesion of the brachial plexus following a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and supercalcification have been reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease and it often occurs with other autoimmune diseases.
The object of our studies was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes in the patient population of the diabetes ward at the children's hospital of the TU Dresden.
There are reports of granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of absorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tooth graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement, resulting in a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiological evidence showed osteolysis in the area of the internal screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign giant cells.
Primary plasmacytomas of the kidney are a major rarity.
To date, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented in whom an operated renal tumour was histologically found to be a plasmacytoma.
This case is used to discuss the treatment of this disease.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement by the plasmacytoma is unclear.
In a multicentre, prospective, clinical trial in 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults were assigned a treatment indication, or therapy, appropriate to the type of fracture.
The success of the primary treatment was assessed by a practice-based score.
A large number of genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al. described the
[40] 5 patients with acquired striated, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We're reporting another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are striped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, no inflammatory pre-stage and no later sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
We suggest the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this condition.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise programme, to improve the muscular situation, which can also be done safely at home.
A group training provides training to improve coordination and joint preservation through the practice of simple sequences of movements and provides basic knowledge of anatomy, the development of arthrosis and knee-friendly and relieving behaviours.
The efficacy of the knee school as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was demonstrated in a prospective randomized trial.
The correct alignment and size of the implants are essential for successful and permanent knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar articular section are presented.
In the Erlanger glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP was shown to be suitable for separating confirmed patients from confirmed controls.
In a retrospective analysis of air rescue, first, the outpatient first aid of 274 acutely injured (58%) and sick (42%) children up to the age of 14 years was examined with reference to timing of calls, compliance with the rescue deadline, age and sex distribution, severity, causes and pattern of injury, type of acute paediatric illness, pre-hospital emergency diagnosis and therapy, as well as the means of transport and the target clinic on the basis of emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the University Orthopaedic Hospital Mainz has been examining for which diseases, the low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be usefully used.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with disease processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient studies in diseases of the haematopoietic system, age- and sex-dependent changes of the proton spectrum from the bone marrow were analyzed in the present study in volunteers.
Therapeutic monitoring is not currently possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without substantial recurrence risk are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic adverse events.
An imperative requirement for P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is the exact validation of the method.
A P wave trigger must be established and the filtering of the P wave must be carried out bidirectionally or with a FIR filter.
Standardisation of the method is highly desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in their P-wavelength from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic agent does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In summary, after optimizing the method, P-wave signalling allows for the identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) has similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain treatment according to the current state of knowledge.
The knowledge of the genesis of pain is a prerequisite for effective pain therapy.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are routed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system.
Central sensitisation mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to the chronicisation of such pain.
Therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is represented by treatment algorithms.
In addition to conventional non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics are particularly important in the treatment of chronic pain.
The prescribing of these substances must comply with defined pain management standards.
Local anaesthetic blockages as a monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
In post-traumatic pain, however, a defined series of peripheral nerve blockades or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages are of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically mediated pain (SMP).
The relevance of radiation to the pelvic lymphatic ducts in lymph node positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, additional radiation to the paraaortic lymphatic outflow channels compared to radiation to the pelvic lymph nodes alone does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumour specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term adverse reactions are only available from studies using obsolete irradiation techniques.
Radiation therapy to the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual choice and should be performed as part of studies (e. g. ARO 95-3).
However, due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendicectomy.
The following article presents the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its specific features and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
A simple primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be treated by thin caliber drainage.
In contrast, in a complicated pneumothorax a large-caliber bulla drainage is indicated.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in respiratory patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
Haematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with a bradine drainage system and surgery when necessary due to the risk of severe blood loss.
Spontaneous haematothorax also requires drainage and an internal examination.
The physician in an ICU must be skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax and haematothorax.
The question of this prospective, single-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine designation of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information to the clinical finding, routine laboratory investigations, microbiology and radiology.
Also, the lethality, the overall severity of injury, the likelihood of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic associated injuries are increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with accompanying peripheral soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip), are a special situation.
The haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the care of organ lesions are the focus of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabulum fractures are more challenging than joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
With an increasing number of these additional pathologies, the long-term outcome worsens.
The primary accidental cartilage injury appears to have a significant influence on the long-term outcome following acetabulum fractures.
An isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta, with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen, caused symptoms typical of aortic stenosis in a 56-year-old patient.
Of note in the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta and the extent of the calcification.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested a differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or a decomposed aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to blood lipid regulation via aortic perfusion.
As the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
With reference to the changes in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has also been questioned recently.
In the discourse on the application and development of reproductive techniques, the experiential aspects of the persons concerned are being overshadowed.
Many people seek help outside of their medical care only when they are exhausted or very disappointed after unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is one of the most common sites of metastasis in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial cancers.
The decision regarding systemic therapy will depend on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases, and the general condition of the patient.
In receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the first choice of therapy.
In patients with receptor negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or in the case of liver metastases, chemotherapy is indicated.
In the case of small cell bronchial carcinoma, chemotherapy should generally be used.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In metastatic non-small cell bronchial or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is more conservative and limited to mainly younger patients and to patients in reasonably good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Recent methods for the determination of bone degradation products in urine may prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and treatment of paediatric back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve endings pain should be investigated.
The risk of occupational HIV infection is often subjectively considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and contagious.
For example, hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, for example, there is a clear recommendation for vaccination of hospital staff against hepatitis B.
In the case of lesions with HBV-containing material, combined active and passive vaccination shall be administered post-exposure.
There is no post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early treatment with interferon on detection of HCV RNA appears to have a high success rate.
In preparations of a pulmonary biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and the patient was diagnosed with angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive responses in both the muscularly differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes resulted in the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal lobe, up to 5 cm in diameter.
Polytope organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in kidney, lung and probably also in brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international debate on assisted death, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to prefer physician-assisted suicide over active killing, not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the assisted suicide of a psychiatrist offers an occasion for examining the matter from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitrogen oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
This study investigated the histochemical and immunohistochemical localisation and distribution of the two constitutive NO synthase isoforms (bNOS and ecNOS) in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
Differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostate gland, stroma and vessels was demonstrated via both NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemical studies.
There appears to be a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation with obstructive hyperplasia preparations, although no quantitative evaluation has been performed due to the small number of preparations.
In the endothelial region, differential expression of NOS depending on the vascular section was also demonstrated by NADPH-d response and immunohistochemistry.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be immunohistochemically confirmed in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high significance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional circulation and secretion of normal and hyperplastic prostates.
Due to the heterogeneous patient groups and multiple causes of ileus, it is difficult to standardise the operative indication and choice of surgical procedure in the thin ileus.
A common approach to the intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of a colonic incision) and the abdominal cover (technique, suture) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small intestine plica are still used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with the Noble operation being largely replaced by Child-Phillips and its variants.
In the absence of controlled studies, there are no guaranteed indications or contraindications for plecturettes, long probes and other surgical procedures.
Given the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of the thin dazzle, changing this remains an important task for the future.
The public demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results obtained through reproductive medicine and its public discussion can increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment and, at the same time, prevent misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for providing reliable advice to couples concerned.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle strength in depressed individuals have been described frequently in the clinical literature, but have rarely been studied empirically.
We collected various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework that is largely based on classical clinical observations of depression.
Twenty hospitalized depressed subjects were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses measuring step length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace, and 3-minute walking distance, and were compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The procedure was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvement was noted at the end of the third week of therapy, particularly in knee and elbow extension and in all gait parameters studied.
The techniques applied to psychiatric issues for the first time in this pilot study are suitable for reliable and low-impact investigation of the relationship between depression and motor skills, and can thus be used in large-scale studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This may lead to an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We're reporting the results of cataract surgery for subluxation lentis and glaucoma.
The effect of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was studied in 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS).
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased plasma levels of substance P (x +/- s:
The highest incidence was observed in PS patients (7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/ l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/ l).
VIP plasma concentrations were not significantly different from the normal values except for minor differences (x +/- s:
Patients in the primary study group who received intolerance were treated with methotrexate (MSP patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/ l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/ l).
We're describing two unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Both had progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of multiple dysostosis and memory phenomena in lymphocytes by age 3, 2 and 4 years, respectively.
The -L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was severely reduced (< 3% of normal).
So far, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventricular-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who came into the hospital with signs of a sub-acute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase negative staphylococci and elevated serum protein were detected in the liquor.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for glucose and ketone bodies in the urine.
This routinely performed test gave strong positive results for ketones in the post mortem of three people who died clearly as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without raising the level of glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography showed excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/ L in all three urine samples.
Thus a highly positive Ketodiabur test 5000 with normal glucose in the urine may be used as a diagnostic aid in detecting death due to hypothermia.
A prospective study in 94 patients with traumatic haemarthrosis of the knee joint will investigate the extent to which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal the underlying source of bleeding and may provide therapeutic guidance.
Infantile acrolokalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in association with several infectious diseases.
An 8-year-old girl had eruptively symmetrical papules and papule vesicles on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, whereas serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
Jaw joint obstructions occur as a result of trauma, joint disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the gum tissue.
The previous classifications are based mainly on the anatomical relationships between the dislocated jaw joint surfaces, such as luxation, subluxation and discusluxation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
Jaw joint occlusions have been described as a complication in a number of neurological disorders.
With the case report of a patient suffering from recurrent jaw dislocation as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocation with botulinum toxin, we introduce the concept of neurogenic jaw dislocation.
Fire marks can lead to significant psychosocial distress.
The present study examined (a) the coping behaviour, quality of life and body experience of patients with fire marks, and (b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A test psychological examination of the disease management, quality of life and body experience was conducted on 70 patients with Fire Colour in the lightning pulsed dye laser therapy.
The clinical endpoint was the degree of lightening of the burn in the course of therapy.
Patients with fiery spots experienced similar levels of social anxiety to those with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the fire painting.
In terms of helplessness and anxiety-depressive mood, patients with fire marks were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
The body experience is differentially affected by disease management.
Because the lighting during the course of laser therapy is significantly correlated with reduced psychosocial stress, lightning pulsed dye laser therapy for fireflies can also be considered effective in terms of psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is a separate disease as its biological behaviour, prognosis and treatment are different from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of the PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas exhibit a variety of pathohistological features and a wide spectrum of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old male was born with a naevus sebaceus in the right temporal lobe.
The histopathological examination revealed 2 adnexoplasms associated with the lesion:
I got a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined appearance of these three entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on a medical history (typical nitro refractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T wave changes, Q-waves, new-found left leg block), and elevations of the "classic heart enzyme" creatine kinase (CK) and CKMB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the leading causes of reversible dementia.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years of age.
At present, the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with hypothyroidism and secondary dementia caused by hypothyroidism is less due to the psychopathological crosssectional profile of the disease than the treatment course of the disease.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalised atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and renal artery stenosis, a proximal left subclavian artery aneurysm was successfully removed by implantation of a balloon expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graft.
Follow-up for one year showed a very good long-term outcome with freely perfused stent lumen and complete aneurysm.
In a control CT scan, found a complete thrombosed aneurysm mass.
The intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a separate entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann, and O'Leary.
However, as early as the first half of the 19th century, there are illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie that almost definitely suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains, along with case histories of various forms of syphilitic skin disease, individual images of gangrenous ulcers which appeared quite unexpectedly under the then common mercury therapy.
The rapidly growing ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as a side effect of this proliferating mercury therapy, as they spontaneously healed after its discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and pictures of pyoderma gangraenosum predate the first description by more than 100 years.
However, the etiology of this disease is still not sufficiently understood.
Thus, the theory of a primary bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangrenosum was maintained in several publications until well into the 1960s.
The rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive function are among the essential criteria for the selection of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study investigates whether recovery of cognitive function is faster following TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/ R) compared to balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/ fentanyl (S/ F).
Steady oestradiol concentrations are achieved, as in the early follicular phase.
Oral estrogen replacement therapy requires 40-fold higher dosing of estradiol compared with TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly variable drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal troughs.
The high doses of oral oestrogen are necessary because oestrogen metabolism is high in the hepatic route.
What is the importance of fetal and neonatal ultrasound examination in the diagnosis and the treatment of meconium peritonitis?
We are describing an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small intestine arteritis, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, and psychomotor retardation with partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The objectives of the present study were to measure the exercise capacity of patients with cystic fibrosis and to detect exercise-induced changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or bladder tumours was to better reflect the biology of the different lesions and to make a sharper distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The relevance for diagnosis and clinical use is critically considered in the light of current immunohistochemical findings.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies will have to show whether this subdivision is warranted.
The present study attempts to establish a relationship between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammatory course of patients following cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
This is called sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causality), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes, and acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant relationship between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back problems.
The diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In case of unclear spiral CT finding of intravenous tumour growth, contrast-enhanced MRI may be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindications for non-ionizing radiographs, patients in the stage of compensated renal failure (not yet requiring dialysis), and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
The conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multiple) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood include scalding, burning, lid injury, corneal erosion, corneal foreign bodies, eyeball impaction, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100 000 inhabitants per year.
Thus they represent the most common cause of one-sided blindness in childhood.
Other risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (< 5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care.
In addition to rapid and adequate treatment, the prognosis of visual rehabilitation following eye injuries is influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or placement of eyes for amblyopia prevention).
Deficits and imbalances in the muscles stabilizing the spine are considered important somatic risk factors for the development of back pain.
Therefore the maintenance and restoration of full performance of the muscles stabilizing the spine must be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation in addition to the training of coordination skills and the learning of spinal-appropriate behavior.
In addition to the various pain therapeutic measures, physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including procedures based on neurophysiology, physico-balneological measures and complementary behavioural training, medical exercise therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical exercise therapy is the application of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated preventive and rehabilitative measures.
The phased structure illustrates various targets of therapy, in particular the positive adjustment of the neuromuscular system to the course of rehabilitation.
The indication and monitoring of medical exercise therapy are medical responsibilities.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, goals and treatment regimen are adapted in collaboration with physical therapists and treating physicians.
The indication for surgery in vertebral slippage is pain, progressive slippage and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but deformity persists and in spondyloptosis, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodes mass may occur with further progression of the slide.
With the external fixator as a repositioning device and the internal fixator for stabilization it is also possible today to reposition severe gliding operations and to restore normal spine and torso shape with acceptable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed which in all cases aims at the anatomical repositioning of the vertebrae, in addition to stabilization and compression of the nerve roots.
Depending on the degree of sliding, the repositioning and stabilization should be performed in 1, 2 or 3 operational steps.
A single dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
In grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylolysis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, selected results of which are reported in this article, is to investigate the effects of a geriatric psychiatric centre (GZ:
(a combination of outpatient services, day clinics and geriatric services) of the process of transition from "intramural" (stationary) to "extramural" (daily and clinical/ambulant, i.e. home-based) regional care structures, required by the Federal government's expert commission and substantiated in detail, is to undergo an empirical examination.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, the changes in the regional sub-structures of gerontological psychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B), and elderly care (subsystem C) are analysed by comparing the health-care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ).
The investigation shows, as regards Subsystem A, that a GC has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care without selecting its clientele according to the nature and severity of the mental disturbance.
An effect of the GZ on the system for the care of the elderly (subsystem C) may be reflected in the fact that in the Gütersloh service region the rate of home treatment after inpatient treatment is considerably lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old female patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis in the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive motor impairment in the right shoulder joint.
Ultrasound and computed tomography revealed, in addition to edema of skin and fat tissue, widespread accumulations of fluid around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitial spaces, and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, skin lesions were quickly healed, and mobility in the shoulder joint was restored later.
In the case described here, modern imaging methods have for the first time demonstrated the involvement of structures close to the joint in eosinophilic cellulitis.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide allows sustained treatment in larger tumours that are not primarily suitable for sustained treatment.
The regression of the tumour can be monitored by mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The advantage of mammography is its good reproducibility and availability.
Tumors that cannot be identified by mammography can usually be imaged by ultrasound.
In MRI the tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammalian parenchyma.
It permits in addition the detection of functional parameters. - Determination of the extent of tumour residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited by all available methods, since microscopically small invasive and in particular noninvasive tumour residues cannot be detected.
These do not recur even after a recurrence of the invasive tumour and typically show intraductal, non-invasive tumour residues.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The clinical manifestations of the disease are symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and marked vegetative disturbances.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for admitting a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
This report discusses the treatment of severe GBS in intensive care using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a specific form of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Stent implantation without foreskin appears to be able to start immediately and thus prevent an emerging dissection in the case of morphologically appropriate stenosis.
Neurosurgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-way functional model has clarified the pathophysiological importance of individual basal nuclei, making them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
Its pathological disinhibition is elicited, inter alia, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in patients with MPTP lesions. - In the clinic, both lesion, restorative and stimulative procedures are currently in use.
Formerly used pallidotomy and thalamotomy techniques have become more precise due to improved neuroradiological and physiological targeting.
The former technique is used to treat rigor, hypokinesia, and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter has been shown to be effective for treating tremor.
Only the transplantation of fetal cells has documented new growth of dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine release;
However, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
High frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the newest method and is characterised by reversibility and adaptability and low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
The animal experimental approach includes xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically modified cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, several years of comparative studies between the different approaches are needed in order to identify the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Sub-acute encephalopathy with seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol related disease alongside more common conditions such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal seizures, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic side-stressed steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after multiple secondary generalized focal attacks of the right side of the body with a suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed increased levels of gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and brain MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3 times of anti-convulsant therapy, seizures and worsening of the general condition were still observed.
Several EEG studies revealed periodic steep left parietooccipital stressed waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria for SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell tumours in childhood and adolescence without association with a basal cell nevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, organoid nevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (there have been 86 cases in the world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortifacient form of BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on the repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage in these patients are not yet available.
There are reports of a 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the medical history nor the clinical examination showed evidence of a genetic predisposition to developing basal cell carcinoma.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study using pelvic cranial biopsies was conducted in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical findings and to assess the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Using morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their progenitor cells, and fiber density were calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryocytes and fibroblasts in view of the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already seen in approximately 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic progenitor cells, which may be related to the inclusion of this cell line in iron metabolism, haemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residues expressing) pseudogaucher cells were detected in 30% of biopsies prior to treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis were calculated using clinical parameters such as haemoglobin, peripheral blood myelo- and erythronormoplastic content, and splenic artery.
These variables clearly indicate more advanced stages of CML.
In accordance with our morphometric analysis, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
This simplified histological classification was accompanied by corresponding haematological data.
Sequence biopsies in 173 patients treated with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) monotherapy showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fibre- reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the major cell lines during treatment are best illustrated by calculation of indices.
These included the relationship of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated sampling and the time differences allocated.
Thus, in patients with complete haematological remission after IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was demonstrated, with an increase in CD68+ macrophage counts including their activated subpopulation.
In the histological subgroups, ongoing examinations revealed a transition from both a granulocytic (non-composed) subtype and a megacaryogenic subtype to a myelofibrotic group in approximately 40% of patients.
This phenomenon was in contrast to a numerical reduction of the myelofibrotic type mainly in patients on HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
In summary, the remarkable heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease progression.
In general, patients admitted in succession to a geriatric ward should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design, in terms of mental disorders.
Based on the clinical examination as well as the Mini-Mental State Examination (2), 51 patients were considered not amenable to examination.
The remaining 74 patients were assessed clinically and using screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia may have been detected or ruled out by neuropsychological testing.
Mental disorders (mostly adaptation disorder or depression) were found in 41 patients, and the disorder was relevant to overall clinical management in over half of these.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable and therefore can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains to be seen how the necessary treatment of the mental disorder in every fifth to sixth patient, according to this result, may be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric ward.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional diagnostic imaging of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages because the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
The potential disadvantages of this method are the dependence on the examiner, the lack of standardization and the relatively high cost.
Therefore, the "Structural Diagnostics in Rheumatology Working Group of the Regional Rheumatology Centre Berlin", composed of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopaedists, has worked out an overview of the diagnostic imaging of sacroiliac arthritis which, in addition to the clinical background, also details technical aspects and takes account of radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job' s syndrome, Jobe syndrome, Buckley syndrome) is a rare disorder of the immune system which may develop characteristic manifestations in the CNS.
The disease is characterised by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of the lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically indicative are highly elevated serum IgE concentrations with no evidence of allergic or parasitic disease.
Therapeutically, treatment with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was well tolerated and effective.
Symptoms have continued to improve for more than a year after a single dose of treatment.
The current state of knowledge and available treatment options in hyper IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper IgE syndrome, a trial of therapy with IVIG should be a first choice option.
The present paper presents the results of laparoscopic floppy-niche fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding scores.
More than 98% of all patients rated the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo another anti-reflux surgery if necessary.
Persistent but not life-threatening side effects from the surgery were reported by 4 patients.
No patients required a second course of medicated anti-reflux therapy.
Laparoscopic refondoplication was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The efficacy of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease by laparoscopic floppy-nipple fundoplicatio can be documented and demonstrated in the longer term not only by objective evidence but also on the basis of the subjective assessment of the patient and measurement of quality of life data.
The clinical evidence with neuroglucopenia is pioneering, demonstrating inadequate insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the starvation test.
Standard surgery is enucleation of the tumor or, depending on the size and location, resection.
Treatment of multiple tumours and islet cell hyperplasia, which have a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be superior to selective tumor removal.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with hepatic metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatic resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the treatment options.
Any form of assisted suicide is punishable under § 216 StGB;
from a medical point of view it is not ethically justifiable.
This fact has not been altered by the many different tendencies towards decriminalizing "death on demand", as in the Netherlands and in Germany, under certain conditions.
Nutrient proportions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished from immunologically active cells of intestinal associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and a major supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in seriously ill people.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are especially important for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are primarily digested by bacteria in the lower intestinal tract into the short chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These have a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa, inter alia by improving blood flow.
Among non-food substances, the most important are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors, which contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucous membrane.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental health.
The use of a diary as a measuring instrument has enabled the identification of individual assessments of situational factors influencing care, and of stress-promoting factors in the care process.
The results show considerable individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their impact on physical and mental well-being.
Talus continuation fractures are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the hip region.
Early diagnosis allows for differentiated treatment options and thus has a significant impact on long-term outcomes.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for a definitive diagnosis and the indication of the therapy to be used.
Dislocated fractures treated conservatively, as far as described in the literature and according to personal experience, lead to pain and reduced mobility and therefore in the long term to arthrotic reconstruction of the subtalar joint.
In the case of indications for surgery, however, the scarce literature suggests that large fragments should be anatomically refixed to allow a sequence-free recovery.
Shrapnel fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, though the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible altered joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unresolved, there are a number of recent findings on the underlying pathological mechanisms and causes of the disease.
Dermal mast cell proliferation and high regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can thus also be detected in non-inflamed skin and increased serum P-selectin, indicating a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells we were also able to detect in adult indolent mastocytosis, but not in childhood forms, activating point mutations in mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesion skin mast cells.
Contrary to general belief, IgE-mediated allergies are rarely the cause of acute urticaria (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the contrary, pseudoallergies to food (73%) and, rarely, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-term remissions in avoidance (diet) or elimination of triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria should primarily be regarded as secondary rather than causative.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a life-threatening pattern of injury through polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to represent the variability of possible injury together with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
Diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which is usually only treated in trauma centres.
The 3 cases are presented in the timeline of polytrauma management and the differentiated options of care are mentioned.
Previous reports of working groups in multicentre studies with small groups of patients indicate that it is problematic to recognise homogeneity and to define it as standards; the presently current guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to the management alongside the most polytraumatized and therefore vitally endangered patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analysed.
In 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course ranging from 2 months to 35.2 years is known (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was observed at higher T stages, with increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (< = 20%/ > 20%), synchronous distant metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1) and the radicality of the intervention (R0/R1, 2) were found to be prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest the prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
As the peak age shifts, measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more a danger for adults.
The MMR combination vaccine is an effective way of preventing this disease and its consequences.
Consistent 2-malignant MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make rubella embryopathy a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adulthood (ILSE) is to identify indicators of healthy and satisfied ageing in both middle and later adulthood.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and agreeableness.
Regional comparisons showed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, and subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region were found in openness and in some subtests of cognitive measurement and physician judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses originate in more than 80% of cases from an intra-abdominal organ and occur mainly after abdominal surgery.
They are divided anatomically into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Percutaneous abscess drainage using sonographic or CT techniques is, for defined indications, a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approximately 80%.
Liver abscesses are treated mainly by intervention, while pancreatic, splenic and Crohn' s abscesses are almost always treated by surgery.
Specific infectious diseases with intraabdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and their specific anatomic, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
Since the mid to late 1980s, different groups of researchers have tried to improve the prediction of preterm birth in preterm birth through immunological diagnostics - especially through cytokine detection.
A disadvantage of this prenatal diagnosis, however, is that so far it is only convincingly proven from amniotic fluid, i.e. through amniocentesis, but not from the serum of pregnant women.
This is because the placental barrier to cytokines is almost impermeable, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the wide range of variation of individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts have been made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
It is possible that detection of cytokines from the cervix of pregnant women by PCR may be a viable avenue for the future.
The load on the spinal internal fixator was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for different activities.
The highest stresses were found in walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher loads on the fasteners were measured when seated than when standing.
Therefore, there is little objection to the admission of patients whose spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand.
The additional ventral stabilisation with bone spans often significantly altered the load on the bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often significantly higher after ventral stabilisation than before.
The application of a corset or a waistcoat did not reduce the load on the implant.
Therefore, it is not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono- or bisegmental stabilisation of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningeomas are among the most common intracranial tumours in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningeoma was added to the revised version of the WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to indicate meningeomas with an increased relapse defence relative to usual meningeomas.
As the same qualitative histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with uncertainties.
We looked for other prognostically relevant parameters:
Using the morphometrically determined nuclear Ki-67 {MIB1-) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningeomas of all 3 grades (N=160) which were valid for the "recurrence" free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meninges are characterised by a loosely structured, syncytial growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Optional were nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitosis figures.
Cytogenetically, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningeomas had distal fragmental loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of cases.
We have been able to demonstrate that in meningomas, the tissue specific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is 1p, can be used as a marker enzyme associated with progression and relapse (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningomas).
Instead of using the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and may give rise to misunderstandings in the context of tumor grading, we suggest the term "intermediate" type meningioma for this group of tumors with a relatively high risk of recurrence, which are between the usual and anaplastic meningomas.
The articulate fractures occupy a special position in the lower jaw fractures due to their particular anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI scans have greatly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment is for highly dislocated or luxated fractures.
The preauricular, sub- or perimandibular, retromandibular and oral approaches are established as operative approaches.
Only functionally stable methods such as the mini plate or the draw screw should be used to fix the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report on the occurrence of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal tumors, and palmoplantar keratoses following treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic containing Fowleri (Fowler's) liquor;
A secondary finding was a diagnosis of Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome.
Background and question.
Despite the importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely underrepresented in the established primary health services.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system on the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The developmental rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to assess the acute and longterm outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single acute care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL allows a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters through the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deep vascular malformations (essential teleangiektasia, Naevi flammei, Erythrosis interfollicularis colli, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high energy flash.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumour in women.
The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, identify risk factors for the occurrence, and to evaluate the benefit of early treatment of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumour manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in its acute stage.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic conditions are often difficult to control.
In addition, many treatment-induced adverse effects occur in the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which were difficult to control even with high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/ azathioprine.
Both animals were treated with IgM enriched high dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to the immunosuppression therapy.
In both cases, the initially high-dose immunosuppressive agents (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) were eliminated to minimal maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained symptom free during a 1-year follow-up period on minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observations show that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, making it one of the most common complaints in childhood.
However, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wavelength UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigment changes).
Besides the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under wood light by addition of fluorescence markers has been applied in the application control of topics.
Endocardial mapping is possible when haemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced during programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circuitry stimulation via stimulation maneuvers ("Entrainment-Mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In patients with clinical presentation and induction of only singular chamber tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in approximately 60 - 70% of cases with HFLC.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
Recurrence is to be expected in 20-30% of cases.
In the case of non-stop ("incessant") ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia following implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapy to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method will be further enhanced in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
The effect of dissected lymph nodes numbers on tumour staging and local recurrence rates was studied retrospectively in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma from 1.1.1985 to 31.12.1995 after conventional surgery and R0 resection of the tumour.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant association between the number of dissected and the number of infected lymph nodes, and with it a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stage I and II.
In the overall and multivariate analyses, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in local recurrence rates in stage I and II UICC is not due to a therapeutic effect but to a stage shift in the context of more exact tumour staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically controllable factors, in particular total mesorectal excision, in the development of locoregional recurrence.
In the field of echocardiography there are no uniform standards for documenting findings.
However, these standards are necessary to allow for comparability of findings and to ensure an optimal electronic communication of findings in order to meet the requirements of quality assurance in echocardiography.
A declining incidence of active TB in developed countries has pushed the disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains the most common infectious disease killer worldwide.
In developed countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing poverty and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, particularly due to the HIV epidemic, are all contributing to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease with subepidermal blistering and scarring, manifested on the skin and mucous membranes.
Eye involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Although asymptomatic disease processes are known in endocarditis as in other diseases (18, 19, 20, 21), clinically asymptomatic defecation has not been reported.
The wealth of knowledge accumulated on interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its first description is increasingly affecting the field of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in two areas of dermatology:
First, there is enough knowledge to suggest that IL-7 may be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study using IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumour cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to be able to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
The objective of this review is to outline the molecular, immunological and preclinical properties and prospective applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
The suitability of high dose Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumours was investigated and whether dynamic studies at this dose would allow a response to pre-operative chemotherapy.
The aim of this work is to make a conceptual contribution to the construction of everyday competence.
After an introductory discussion of the reasons for the increased attention to everyday skills in gerontology, a first part outlines six research trends with a relevance to everyday skills:
The second part presents and discusses two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis.
The third part presents an integrative conception of everyday competence which links aspects of the six research streams with the essential elements of the two models of everyday competence.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumour control with increasing overall treatment duration of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during therapy.
A targeted inhibition of the proliferation of cloned cells during radiation therapy could, therefore, potentially lead to significant advances in radiation oncology.
A short overview discusses the possibilities for minimizing the time factor.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumour angiogenesis is of scientific interest but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not yet been established.
The only currently secure method is to perform radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned interruptions in treatment.
The acute inflammatory response is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We studied 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour of admission and at intervals of 4-24h for TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02 mg/ dL).
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome.
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with CRP and TnT positive 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression based on the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (4-24h respectively), age, sex and diagnosis, showed an independent effect of TnT (cut-off 0.1 μg/ L, p=0.048, odds ratio = 7.5) and CRP (cut-off 0.862 mg/ dL, p=0.026, odds ratio = 5.3).
Sensitivity/ specificity for the diagnosis of AMI was 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP during 4-24 hours.
Highly sensitive CRP assays are of little help for the acute diagnosis of infarction in addition to troponin T.
However, the assessment of patient prognosis by TnT is significantly and independently enhanced by CRP 4-24h post-admission.
A 5 1/2-year-old girl with an optic glioma and resulting hydrocephalus internus developed progressive ascites seven months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was found in the liquor and in the liquid ascites.
For the first time, a violation of the blood-liquid barrier was found to be the cause of increased serum protein by liqueur protein electrophoresis.
Ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urethral conduction with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, with liver injury associated with portal hypertension, the risk of recurrent, peripheral and transfusion-responsive blood clots is increased.
While the diagnosis is simple, a variety of treatment options are available.
Generally the source of bleeding is varicose vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerosis with 3% ethoxyclerol or blockage of the bleeding vessel is appropriate.
Resection of the varicoceptor-associated conducting site is an option in the event of life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, removal of the conduit should also be considered.
Malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumour cells are mostly determined by acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor organs - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningeomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterised solid tumors:
A number of species specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known to be associated with clinical parameters such as recurrence degeneration of meningeomas or malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression characteristic of gliomas in particular, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumour cells, which are also co-determined iatrogenically by radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnoea due to a thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) for mitral stenosis III 6 years previously.
Three years later, she developed a valve thrombosis that required a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
In the past 10 years, there has been increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumour progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis.
The formation of metastases is a cascade of complex, interacting single steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of cancer cells from the epithelial lining by loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumour cells is promoted by angiogenic factors which may lead to the degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, exit from the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastasis process.
Furthermore, once a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will survive only if it escapes the immunological defences.
The systematic identification of tumour antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic interventions.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid gland, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, and rarely in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11.
This gene is thought to be one of the tumor suppressor genes whose allele loss triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumours in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus may metastasize, but most have a low malignancy potential.
MEN 1 is most frequently seen between the ages of 20 and 35 years, mainly with hyperparathyroidism and/ or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical trials have examined the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using various methods of preserving donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was problematic here, because, despite the longstanding knowledge of dynamic cell loss, very variable follow-up intervals were summarised.
The aim of this study was to carry out a long term endothelial finding at identical times, taking into account two different preservation techniques.
Patients on long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a variable risk of perioperative thromboembolism requiring continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of coagulation inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
For elective procedures, coumarin administration is discontinued for 2-3 days before surgery, and for emergency procedures, vitamin K or Fresh Frozen plasma replacement is required.
Surgery in patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic as the effect of heparin is diminished within a few hours upon discontinuation.
Data on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany are available from various epidemiological studies.
Translating the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the general population in Germany gives estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient identification, the epidemiological area and structure of the population concerned.
To avoid these problems, the number of patients with multiple sclerosis diagnosed was collected through a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of opportunity to clarify the diagnosis.
Calculation and subsequent aggregation of the results of the questionnaire of the individual groups of doctors revealed a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100 000 inhabitants and is in the range of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category " questionable MS" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells which subsequently produce more growth factors in the fracture area.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
The transfer of genes can be considered as a promising new technique of in situ tissue engineering, with clinical application in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the family doctor.
The quality of the doctor-patient dialogue is crucial for diagnosis and treatment.
While in the 1970s the doctor's conversation style was considered a personality variant, current empirical studies of the doctor-patient conversation suggest that doctor conversation behavior should be understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners (physician-patient) coordinate their conversation behavior.
Training programmes to improve basic psychosomatic competence in general practice often show very little success as they do not adequately address the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of the Düsseldorf training and education programme on basic psychosomatic care.
The training concept and the experience gained with it are finally presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All of these sources are only marginally applicable to clinical practice.
Programming the speech processor of a cochlear implant (CI) in young children, specifically determining the amount of stimulation that corresponds to the maximum acceptable sound volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Over stimulation must be avoided as this may have a traumatising effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stepsedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and auditory thresholds determined during postoperative language processor setting in 27 carriers of three different implant types.
It was examined whether the ESR threshold is a practical and applicable objective tool for simplifying, refining and speeding up language processor programming.
For Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as the percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level over all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively recorded step-diode reflex thresholds sometimes showed large deviations from thresholds effectively determined by behavioural audiometry.
Thus, reliable and simple computational determination of the MAL and the auditory threshold was not possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold may contribute to a computational limitation of the range to be tested in addition to intraoperative functional monitoring.
However, the exact MAL will have to be determined by another, provisional, behavioural audiometric approach.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swellings in the red portions of a multi-colored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was observed which could be distinguished from real lymphoma by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be the result of a dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Imaging new diagnostic possibilities in kidney by means of rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
A 34- year-old patient had developed a goose-sized, bulbous and warty mammary gland in the left anterior axillary for 8 years.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic surgery, damage to the arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur.
Both highly acute and masked complications, as well as the therapy employed, are described using four case studies.
The vascular status of the extremities should be obtained before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
The term "delusion" is understood as intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency to subjective certainty, which lose their alienating character as an object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations that give rise to delusion are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure of actualization on imagination, which is increased in psychotic constitutions, is a precondition for insanity.
Furthermore, there is the failure of de-actualization, caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
The case studies are illustrative of the reasoning that the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronicity.
The inflammatory pseudotumor is usually singular and is a benign tumour first described in the lung.
A case was described of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing difficulty as a result of a thickening of the anterior septum.
Macroscopically, a charcoal tumor was found in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed based on a review of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the present study, therefore, we present options for examination of finger and fingercap arteries in healthy subjects using colour coded duplex ultrasound.
The question was whether a standardised representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the colour Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all subjects studied (n = 10).
In addition, in the case of a patient with endangiitis obliterans, it can be shown that, with appropriate equipment and techniques, the method can detect pathological variations in vessels of this size.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for re-implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery exhaustion and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the operational life of the replacement system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instrumentation as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems make it possible to perform mitral valve surgery via a limited right anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but non-metastatic tumour-like lesions with a recurrence rate of 40%.
Trauma, endocrine, and genetic factors all play a role.
The preferred locations are the trunk and the extremities adjacent to the trunk.
In addition to determining the size and extent of the tumour, the combination of various imaging techniques makes it possible to limit the number of differential diagnoses to a few.
Whereas in earlier years surgical resections became a monopoly, the emphasis is increasingly on adjuvant therapy, such as radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy.
Acute mutilation and subsequent loss of function are justified only in the event of recurrent, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment regimen for atopic eczema includes continuous topical basic dermatological therapy in combination with time-limited exacerbation-mediated anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in case of treatment resistant course.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used in the treatment of microbial superinfections.
Exacerbations can often be successfully treated with phototherapy, particularly UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine, can normally be omitted in the treatment of atopic eczema or only in a few exceptional cases, is a therapeutic alternative.
This case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with an aqueous nasal discharge, recurrent epistaxis, and a slowly progressive left-accented nasal breathing obstruction for examination in the CNS department of BWK Ulm.
The clinical examination and CT scan of the nasal cavities revealed a tumor that filled the entire left nasal cavity, apparently originating from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected by midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological examination revealed the diagnosis of a neuroma.
Based on these case studies and a review of the literature, the diagnosis and treatment of this rare nasal tumour are described.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment for lumbar disc prolapse.
Although statistically complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than in surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse, they can lead to significant disorders.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding and transverse myelitis.
This should be taken into account in the indication of chemonucleolysis and in patient education.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and gentle treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative to systemic therapy with dapsone.
Based on the question of the need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counselling/conciliation services, the effectiveness of psychosomatic/dermatological counselling services was analysed in more detail for the first time in this study.
The extent of compliance to referral was assessed and correlated to possible influencing factors such as frequency of consultation, preference and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics.
Two years after the consultation, questionnaires were sent and the medical records were analysed for this purpose.
In a sample of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action the compliance rate was 78.3%, compared to the rate of 69% in the subgroup with a recommendation for psychotherapy.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics and there was no influence of the frequency of contact.
Only one interview was conducted in 70.5% of the cases.
A positive attitude to consultation and a pleasant conversation were positive factors in promoting compliance.
All in all, therefore, a high degree of efficiency was achieved with relatively little time and work.
There is a report of a 29-year-old female patient with an unusual pigmentation on her face.
From clinical standpoint, the pigmentation lesion was consistent with a naevus spilus, and histological diagnoses confirmed the presence of multiple blue naevus, along with a low lentiginous component and dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change turns out to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require significantly more fluid intravenously than would be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in the starling forces - especially in vascular permeability - may play a role, but have not been studied more closely.
The debate on the outcome of open spinal surgery, particularly on surgical complications such as post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc disorder, in the past.
Percutaneous nucleotomy techniques are techniques based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc winding or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradical laser procedures and some endoscopic intradical surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 1970s.
Treatment outcomes range from about 30% good and very good to nearly 100% good and very good, depending on the author and the study.
It is striking that the prospective randomised trials which have comparator groups - whether conservative or surgically treated groups of patients - are very rare.
The results of intradiscal treatment procedures are assessed more often critically and with lower success rates than the sometimes retrospectively studied representations of individual techniques which, while often having very large case numbers, cannot stand well against the rigorous scientific criteria of study design.
Overall, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat part of the lumbar disc lesion, as a limited indication is necessary for successful therapy.
At the present time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are limited to a smaller number of cases than endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today VasoSeal (US), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their relevance to use after coronary intervention.
The published application success rates for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
The haemostasis periods are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14', with mobilisation periods of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, and major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems showed a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all documented a significant decrease in haemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is mainly due to the removal of the valves immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by reducing length of stay.
In the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and any epiretinal membranes from the retina at the time of the vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula of presumed intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been extracting the membrana limitans interna (MLI) around the foramen from the retina.
Clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and Primary dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left femoral block, non-diagnostic primary electrocardiogram, hospital stay >= 12 h, or unknown hospital stay.
To describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis versus Primary dilation, we examined data from the Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) study.
A drug addict who died five days after the first symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis in liver coma.
Serological diagnosis included clear hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and superinfection with delta virus (delta hepatitis was not detected until postmortem).
This has resulted in prolonged fat embolism (over days) in the pulmonary tract with consequent extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
Tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 40 patients with Alzheimer' s disease, 5 patients with dementia of other causes, and 36 cognitively undetectable control subjects.
Of the Alzheimer patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total score on the mini-mental state test 25 to 28 points).
In these, a significant increase in tau was also measured in comparison to the control subjects.
A less marked increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In the Alzheimer' s patients there was no quantitative association between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit as measured by SPECT.
The results suggest that tau may also be elevated in the predimen­tal stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the past decade, an uncommon amycrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients with an autoimmune disorder.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis mainly in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically imposed subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophil pustulation.
This paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem following vascular reconstructive surgery.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodelling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenic mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis, by prolonging the survival time of intimate cells, resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
To this end, human atherotomy samples from 25 primary and 14 residual lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were evaluated using the TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (median cell densities:
A major finding of this study was that hypercellular restenosis showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Ultrastructural studies here showed a significantly lower proportion of intimal plaque cells, particularly smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%.
In the incidence of necrosis, there was no difference between the two platelet types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necroses/ cell);
Thus, our data indicate apoptosis rather than necrosis as the underlying form of cell death, with differences between the two lesions in significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich residues.
The present findings suggest that reduced apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as commonly seen in human restenosis following angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that may manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
The following is a detailed description of the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The current incidence of microbially induced (infectious) endocarditis (MI) is estimated at seven cases per 100 000 population per year and has been rising steadily for years.
The prognosis is highly dependent on rapid diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is essential in addition to the most diagnostically significant clinical examination.
Cultures-negative endocarditis requires either discontinuation of inadvertently initiated antibiotic therapy and review of the blood culture techniques used, or application of serological/ molecular biology techniques to identify the causative agent.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, particularly when substances with potentiating toxic effects are used.
Large (> 10 mm) mitral valve vegetation is associated with a high risk of thromboembolism and is therefore typically an independent surgical indication, especially when the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable combination of antibiotics is greater than 2 μg/ ml.
During the first three weeks after the onset of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolism is not a contraindication to surgery with a heart-lung machine, if primary cerebral haemorrhage has been excluded by cranial computed tomography, and surgery is performed early prior to the development of a post-apophletic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 h).
Significant improvement in prognosis by early surgical intervention has also been demonstrated in diseases complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially following acute valvular insufficiency), the development of acute renal failure, platelet infection in primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral valve, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
Transvaginal ultrasound is particularly suited to study the embryonic brain, since the large, "cystic" ventricles of the brain can be relatively easily imaged.
However, sonoembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles, with a disproportion of the parts of the brain containing either an increased or decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity in the contours of the back.
The Infectious Diseases Act will put the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
Both certain cases in cases of suspicion, illness or death are to be reported (mainly by doctors) and the laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law shall determine the particulars which must be given by the obliged entities with the report.
It also lays down which data may be transmitted by the health authority.
In particular with regard to reports of suspicion or evidence of pathogens, not all information that should be reported is already available through the report, so in those cases the Health Authority will have to carry out its own investigations in order to be able to provide the necessary information.
The health offices are also responsible for grouping together the reports received from doctors and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
To this end, case definitions have been developed.The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form to facilitate the compilation of the data to be transmitted to the Health Office.
The transmission to the RKI is then effected through the competent Land authority designated by the Land.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of cancer cases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, nearly 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer patients tend to suffer from a variety of physical and mental disorders which, if inadequately treated or not treated, lead to a marked loss of quality of life.
Pain is the predominant symptom with correspondingly severe impact on the patient and his family.
Although there are therapeutic concepts for adequate pain management, these are often not implemented to an adequate degree.
This paper therefore gives a comprehensive overview of pain management as a crucial cornerstone of palliative care.
Due to the central importance of the liver for the synthesis of essential haemostasis components and its functional role in the reticuloendothelial system, hepatic diseases result in laboratory analyses of decreased values of hepatically synthesised haemostasis factors and signs of increased plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In compensated haemostatic disturbance, there is usually no need for symptomatic treatment of the haemostatic disturbance.
If this labile condition is further disturbed by various noxes, bleeding with a more or less consumable coagulopathic or hyperfibrinolize-like constellation of findings and only exceptionally thromboemboliocy are clinically most common.
Prevention of astigmatism induction following seamless corneal cataract surgery.
A routine review of medication is required as part of fall prevention.
A random sample of 276 hospital patients over the age of 75 was used to evaluate the frequency of medicinal products that may increase the risk of falls by inducing dizziness.
Between different heart centres, the amount of bleeding differs by up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive bleeding leads to increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and hence the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
Each of these strategies is critically assessed.
The use of allogeneic transfusions is reduced by avoiding preoperative anaemia, tolerance of low haemoglobin, the use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol.
The perioperative maintenance and rapid recovery of normal body temperature significantly improves haemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent discipline at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical guidelines of the European Union.
With persistent dedication and much effort, oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989.
The UEMS Section of Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussions of relevant issues among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to his actions, at the end of the 20th century, GPC surgery was recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries, with some 3,800 specialist physicians.
The development of otomycosis, particularly after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, the introduction of fungi into the middle ear can cause serious complications.
In particular preoperative rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is therefore essential.
However, all anti-fungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous solution of miconazole.
Three comparator solutions, "E 153" (3), a complete electrolyte solution for intravenous infusion, and the balanced solutions Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2, developed for eye surgical treatment, were evaluated for their potential influence on the postoperative course of inflammation following cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/ defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The mean age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 female.
As underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was 57% ventricular tachycardia and 43% survived CPR.
A single chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or dual chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
25 patients received a subcutaneous patch or array system and 2 patients received an epicardial patch system, 92 patients received abdominal and 248 received pectoral implants.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in 33 patients (9.7%).
18 of patients with a tube-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral unit, the rate of probe-related complications was three times greater in the dual- chamber cardioverter/ defibrillator arm at 12% compared to the single chamber cardioverter/ defibrillator arm, at 4% (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed mainly based on a routine X-ray examination, a quarter (24%) clinically (inefficient treatment regimens, pain) and a fifth (21%) on electrical parameters.
The efficacy of radiosynovial osteoarthritis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint disease, in particular chronic polyarthritis, has been investigated.
Unlike conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not rotate an X-ray tube mechanically around the patient but instead directs an electron beam to semi-circular targets around the patient, where the X-ray radiation is then produced.
This ultra-fast technique has made it possible to produce axial sections of the heart in 50 and 100 ms, respectively, and to accurately image all the structures of the heart with a local resolution of < 0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional representation of a patient's heart.
Detection of coronary calcium with EBT must be considered as the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary artery disease, including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for the assessment of the course of angioplasty and aortic coronary artery bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen in the assumption of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and motor artefacts as well as superposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, EBT has already resulted in clinically-assessable, noninvasive representations of coronary arteries, which may be further optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become established as the vessel of choice over the last 25 years.
In addition to the established angiography procedure, in recent years duplex sonography has been increasingly used as a noninvasive imaging technique to examine this vessel.
In a preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients showed a consistent result as compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic rate, corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial stream bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flux rate.
These non-invasive findings from transthoracic duplex sonography were confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in assessing the revascularisation outcome in the post-operative setting.
Given the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly prominent.
Peripheral artery dissections are particularly common in male hypertensive patients over 60 years of age, characterised by cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a marked rarity.
These are predominantly young patients with or without immediate history of trauma.
On the basis of a case of traumatic dissection of A. cerebri media in a 7-year-old girl, the aetiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology and morphological findings of aneurysmatic dissection of intracranial arteries are discussed taking into account the case reported in the literature.
The paper shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of retirement and nursing homes.
The adjustment aims to strengthen the customer orientation of homes, to highlight their core competencies and to strengthen the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposedly ideal models, but rather it is the task of management bodies to develop and implement country-specific solutions taking into account the respective circumstances.
This is reported from a phenotypic female newborn of the 37th SSW, who died of renal failure on the 14th day of life.
The child had a normal male chromosome sequence of 46 XY and an abnormally severe diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the end of the 1960s, accidents have been one of the main causes of infant morbidity and mortality in the western industrialized countries.
While most accidents in older children and adolescents occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded and documented, there are no recent epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infants and young children, which tend to be related to domestic activity.
In a study on the efficacy of an acellular pertussis vaccine we were able to record and analyse the incidence of accidental hospitalizations of 10 271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
There are 2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts, which caused a long-term lumbar-granulomatous symptom.
In both cases there was a mixture disturbance in the sense of a pollakisuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical application of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image analysis, on the other by the fact that conventional techniques can only image one layer per heartbeat.
New developments in both CT and accelerated imaging techniques make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the 2 mm range.
As an example of such imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient coplanar sequence with prior saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based perfusion measurement for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods used to determine cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood circulation ratios in ribbed ruptures are an important parameter, especially as regards the prospects of surgical treatment, the present study was intended to illustrate the vascularisation of the knee ligament.
The specific circulatory status was investigated by microangiography on 21 cadaveric preparations.
The study showed a proximal supply through 1 or 2 major vessel trunks preferentially occurring in the ventral band portions.
Vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the reduced vascularisation of the distal striations, we would recommend striation by means of fibrin adhesion, allowing atraumatic recovery without the risk of vascular strangulation due to adhesion.
Every year, about 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (about 75% of all cardiac operations) are operated on in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, primarily the saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years minimally invasive vein removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today the saphenectomy is largely done by continuous incision of the skin from ankle to groin to open the saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders following open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every cardiac surgery follow-up after coronary surgery, and are the reason for the evaluation of new minimally invasive removal techniques.
The technique presented (modified 'bridge' technique) shows the desired results, in particular a very high degree of satisfaction with the cosmetic result and a very small reduction of the saphenectomy wound (n).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral deformity of the ventral thoracic wall, with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the M. pectoralis major, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly, and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, mamilla and mamma.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of coexistence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We're reporting another patient with this rare combined malformation.
This study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels are an early predictor of the threat of sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the different magazines and publishers vary widely in both quality and quantity.
Online publications offer many advantages over traditional publications, such as low production costs and the rapid, location- and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that online publications will not replace the printed versions, but will constitute a useful complement to the existing information provision.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who developed a rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police stop".
This case study describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aorto-enteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic prosthesis.
The preoperative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of preoperative diagnosis and the 2 alternative surgical therapeutic approaches, in situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization, are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not carried out in Germany.
According to opponents of PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents argue that under certain legal considerations, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude PGD.
In view of this situation, no PGD has so far been carried out in Germany.
The discussion, which has been intense for some time in Germany, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Case studies suggested that the muscle relaxant potency of Atracurium was reduced in the presence of intrathoracic hernias.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective clinical trial.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unknown origin (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature above 38.3 degrees C for at least three days, that remains aetiologically unclear even after one week of hospital clearance.
A quarter of these cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden droppings, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
The present paper presents profilometry, a modern method of determining the surface structure of the skin.
A rapidly curing plastic material is applied to the skin surface over a defined measuring area, producing imprints of the skin corresponding to its negative image.
In the subsequent measuring procedure, the "rigidity" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a graph.
A statistical programme can be used to analyse, store and compare measurement data.
We tested this method to detect possible improvements in skin surface texture after applying oestrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The water to serum and whole blood ratio is set at 1.2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol forensic analysis for the conversion of serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
A large multicenter study of 833 cases, also representative of the population undergoing the blood-sampling procedure for drinking offences, has measured a mean distribution factor of 1.16 with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of the cases, the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. The deviation from the mean is less than 3% in 96% of cases.
Paradoxical emboli are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the typical constellation is venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure, and consecutive right-to-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic childhood disease patterns that change during growth by reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A meaningful comparison of the different forms of therapy is possible only through the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
The vascular lesions were diagnosed after admission to hospital by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and the derivation of the Doppler signal across the wrist arteries.
The emergency operations performed for all 10 children included in the first step the repositioning and fixation of the fragment with cross-K wires via a line-side access.
The subsequent assessment of blood circulation revealed a pulse return (passerine vascular occlusion) in 2 of the 10 children.
Eight of the 10 children had no pulse, requiring emergency vascular examination.
Intraoperatively, we saw one of the eight children had a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion.
In accidental strangulation (2 of 5 children), pulse transfer to the hand occurred immediately after separation of the connective, strangulation tissue.
For intimate lesions (3 out of 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patch.
A combined vascular occlusion (mechanical functional occlusion) was seen in 2 of these 8 children.
During the follow-up, wrist pulses were measured in 9 children, and on colour-diplex sonogram 9 children had a physiological signal, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal of A. brachialis, A. radialis, and A. ulnaris.
Late ischemic lesions (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) were not observed in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility indicated a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and equal lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The supporting joint axis was normal in all children when compared side by side.
The culture detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little use to pediatricians since the bacterial culture is successful in only 30-60% of pertussis patients and results are not expected for 3-5 days.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment option for locally advanced, deep-seated tumours.
In a randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400 mg RRR-tocopherol acetate/ day) was assessed against diclofenac sodium (3x50 mg/ day) in inpatients with established chronic polyarthritis.
After 3 weeks of treatment, significant improvement in all clinical parameters examined was observed with both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and diclofenac (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90 minutes to 68 minutes with vitamin E therapy and from 68 minutes to 30 minutes with diclofenac.
The Ritchie joint index decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac).
The grip strength increased in both the vitamin E and diclofenac groups.
There was also a significant reduction in pain severity based on a 10-cm visual analogue scale in both groups.
The overall physician and patient outcome was similarly positive for the two medicinal products.
In particular, in view of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, high-dose vitamin E is a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they may be filled with air or even bloated if there is a fistula to the oesophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is shown.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary anterior anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicyst lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal resection and Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly developed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 mmol/l and 4.3 mmol/l) within a few weeks during intoxication from synthetic drugs (Ecstasy and Speed).
In decompensated diabetic metabolic state (HbA1c initial 11.7%), the insulin injections were withheld under drug influence.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate hydration at the first manifestation of ketoacidosis.
The clinical picture showed peritonitis symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disturbances of consciousness, including agitation or hallucinations and obsession, are mainly related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin replacement.
The procedures were straightforward.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff-Cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation has been reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died of cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellow discoloration, grooves and fissures with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthetic dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
In a prospective study, 36 patients were treated with ambulatory arthroscopy for talus roll osteoochondrosis dissecans and monitored according to a standardised protocol at 4 and 12 months.
It has been shown that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement of the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the flock was in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, tibial piercing or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy in concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes at the anterior tibial border.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical outcome make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper hip joint.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock.
The former is treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, whereas the latter is already greater in the case of pulmonary edema.
Therapeutically, in addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used.
However, the mortality rate of cardiogenic shock whose cause cannot be treated is >85%.
In a double-blind study in 31 subjects, cognitive dysfunction following single oral therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam was quantified using a standardized and validated test (SCT) system.
The disturbances were partly consistent with the clinical picture of moderate to severe transient syndrome or organic psychosis.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia with no lightening tendencies occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination disturbances were particularly evident by the detection of a crude rotational stagnation, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam administration.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for imaging and clinical investigation distribution and for videoconferencing applications.
The introduction of rapid gradient systems allows a very good representation of the extracranial carotid flow path in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
The preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique can be used to depict vessels without contrast.
The use of ultrafast gradient echosockets (GES) allows first-pass mapping of the carotid from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s for intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
The advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed in this paper.
In order to ensure optimal quality contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), consideration should be given to the timing of the quantity and flow rate of contrast medium-maximum-injection and the matching of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid return of blood from the venous sinuses to the venous jugular vein.
First, the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries was determined in a model and computer simulation.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
Through gradual variation of local resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed for subjects and some patients, allowing the clinical application of CE-MRA in the field of extracranial carotid artery flow.
The best qualitative results were obtained using a double dose technique at an injection rate of 2 ml/ s.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further research is needed on the optimal application of SM while still at a very early stage of technology.
Different pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are taken to prevent this complication.
Pre-operative measures include delaying surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative gymnastics program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include precise placement of the incisions, including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension must be avoided at the time of tibial graft fixation.
The postoperative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, early initiation of an exercise programme and regular clinical monitoring.
From the experience of its own clinic, when the measures mentioned above are taken, the development of arthrofibrosis after surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical treatment options play an important role.
The main objectives are the restoration of the passage, secretion and pain reduction.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative treatment options.
Thus in many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present paper describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition among the elderly is one of the most common and least noticed diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or in home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population studied, a prevalence of malnutrition is reported of up to 60%.
This leads, particularly in periods of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, to a lack of energy, combined with general malnutrition.
To accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical parameters of the diet.
These allow for tailored nutritional therapy.
The main deficiencies in the sick elderly are protein, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, increases healthcare costs, and is associated with high mortality.
With the rapid increase in the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will worsen.
Malnutrition should therefore be given greater attention by being taken seriously as an independent disease and by being integrated into the curriculum of medical and nursing training.
In addition to tumour thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumour site and sex of the tumour carrier, the Cox multivariate hazard analysis identifies ELND as an independent prognostic factor.
In the stratification according to the mentioned prognostic parameters, the observed survival curves in the Kaplan Meier "with" and "without" ELND differ significantly in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with melanoma > 2.5 - 4 mm thick in the head, neck, chest and groin;
Males with > 1.5-4 mm thick melanoma of the same location and with > 2.5-4 mm thick melanoma on arms, legs and abdomen (except for acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the range of risks with predicted benefit can be further specified by testing of specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication situation.
Applicants for a driving licence are required not only to have an adequate level of vision but also legally to be capable of making "reliable use" of the device.
The nystagmus patient may do this by, for example, using head-face compulsion or other compensatory mechanisms.
He may not do so under the investigation regulations in force (Annex XVII, §§ 9 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
Eruptive hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated hair in children and young adults.
There are reports of a 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle chorion with preserved stratum granulosum, central retinated keratin, and numerous hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive cell cysts and steatocystoma multiplex are histopathologically distinct, and thus constitute separate disease-related conditions.
Basilar angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV infected patients.
By molecular biological methods both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana have been identified as possible agents.
The bacteria can be histologically represented by varthin-starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterised by cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules, including ulcerated nodules.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen may be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with a BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules and bone changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in a return of all the symptoms of the disease.
Thoracocoscopic stabilisation and spondylolysis of the ventral column were performed in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries.
The experience gained has made it possible to significantly reduce operating times.
2 patients were converted to open-label treatment at the start of the series.
Our own experience demonstrates the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Major advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and shortened inpatient stay.
Objective of operation Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid intramedullary locking bolt in non-dipped technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of the supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for the assessment of acromion form in three dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal incisions and compared on the healthy and diseased sides.
The acromion form was compared with the Bigliani classification in conventional X-ray imaging.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis encompasses a number of different conditions which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, the latter are not pathogenic.
In particular, the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to be recurrent and long-term and may additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The main purpose of the biopsy is to exclude the tumour and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There is no histological differentiation between these forms of chronic osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically ageing society, but must demonstrate its social utility under the changing conditions of changing age structure.
In the practical situation, this has led to a corresponding need for professional guidance and to the search for a consensual and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
The use of the method of direct immunofluorescence allowed us to detect in a patient, linear deposits of IgG lambda-L chains, an early component of the C1q complement, and discrete C3 deposits along the preserved elastic fibres in the dermis, especially in the papillary stratum, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this respect, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extremely exposed to daily use and therefore also highly vulnerable to injury.
The many functions of the hand require, in addition to vitality and sensitivity, undisturbed motor function and stability.
In the most severe injuries, very often only residual or replacement functions are possible.
Complex hand trauma results in combined extensive damage to the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
The basic aim is to provide comprehensive primary care.
Due to the multiple damage, the emphasis is on extensive debridement.
The primary reconstruction shall be carried out, as far as possible, of the destroyed tissue.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin sheath is replaced by a hardened or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of long periods of ischemia, this approach is used in that blood flow is restored first.
Our results of restoration of vitality and sensitivity are summarized.
The outcome of recovery of a complex hand injury is any function of the hand recovered or created.
It is therefore not justifiable to treat such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the human and local conditions for providing a special department.
The treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible based on the results of 5 large randomised trials with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, according to PTCA, the number of re-interventions is much higher.
In the long term, mortality was lower in the operated group in diabetic patients in the BARI study.
Individual treatment recommendation by the treating physician has also been shown to be an important factor in the patient' s prognosis.
The influence of newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomised trials.
There is a report of a 34-year-old patient with the rare disease parakeratosis variegata, which occurs after a period of 4 years following pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
To investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the parapsoriasis group to each other and their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases exhibited characteristic histologic changes and a predominance of lymphocytic epidermotropic T cell filtrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor within both changes could not be established.
So we're interpreting both conditions as separate entities, and in this case, they're unrelated to low-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma.
A histological finding of the location of a suspected tumour lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resection margin (R0 or R1) must be as precise and unambiguous as possible.
We report on two technical aids which, in our experience, are particularly useful for mammalian excised:
1) Radiopake threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
Contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anaesthetic circuits produces Compound A, which may have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been performed in volunteers to analyse the effects of Compound A on renal function.
A total of three studies investigated the effects of 8-hour anaesthesia with a 3% vol. concentration of sevoflurane in human subjects, each using fresh gas flows of about 2 l/min.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from renal tubular cells in the urine of subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent investigations found either no relevant or no change in renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3 vol.% sevoflurane administered to subjects over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
The transposaion of these results to clinical practice will in any case take account of the experimental nature of the anaesthesia used in these studies.
Although the subject of low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical studies, suggest that kidney function after surgery in low-flow settings is similar to that of isoflurane.
So far, there is no published experience in the German-speaking world in the treatment of paraphilias (pedophilia, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulsive acts with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists.
In this study, we are describing 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate over a 12-month study period.
During treatment no further acts of sexual aggression occurred and patients reported a marked reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic regimens appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
So we looked at five different intraoperative heat treatments for their effectiveness.
Baker and colleagues first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
The ultrapulsed CO2 laser is an advanced device which has other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty by both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both methods are widely available.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnosis, but duplex sonography has become of prime importance owing to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography is indispensable.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the use of the two approaches is practised as the "golden partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
The chronic rejection reaction is the most important unsolved problem of kidney transplantation today.
The aim of this study was to clarify whether reendothelialisation or reepithelialisation by extra-areneal cells occurs after transplantation, or whether the graft remains allogeneic.
With this in mind, we investigated nine graft animals from opposite sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridisation (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were employed to characterize the infiltrating cells and those involved in the graft vasculature pathology.
Our study demonstrated that for several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells maintained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were inflammatory cells, composed mainly of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Association as one of the methods for shortening the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey will determine the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this connection since then and what experience has been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments Doppler sonography is also used as a decision aid for the identification of brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
The answer to the question of whether false positives occurred was "yes" five times.
The meeting revealed that the investigators had deliberately reported borderline situations in which the preconditions were not entirely met.
In none of these cases was ultrasound used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to establish the cerebral circulation status and to help in the decision-making for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further confirm the diagnosis, and rarely as a sole method of reducing waiting time.
The endogenous formation of CO is exclusively controlled by the microsomal haemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
The present study therefore examined the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress inducible isoform of the enzyme following haemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerol leads to a conversion of crystalline lipid structures in the corneal lipids into liquid crystalline states.
It improves the hydration of the horn layers substantially, and clearly above the urea effect, especially when used in O/W emulsion.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the stratum corneum and thus the corneal calcification.
particularly with long-term application, the skin deformation may be enhanced by glycerol in the suction test.
The roughness of the skin surface is also affected by the preparation containing glycerine in terms of smoothing.
Glycerine also provides a protective effect against surfactants and lipophilic contaminants when used in O/W emulsions.
This is likely to be due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol induces a flow from the depths of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, like urea, glycerin may improve drug penetration.
Aim of operation Stabilisation of the posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by means of a posterior bone block and a capsule surgery.
Long-term complications resulting from venous graft degeneration can be reduced by this surgical procedure.
Because of long operating times and the increased operative trauma in the use of multiple arterial grafts, these have only been used exceptionally until now.
We are reporting our results on the complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Materials and methods:
Between March 1996 and July 1999, 405 patients with coronary artery disease were performed complete arterial revascularization at our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic internal artery, in 299 patients (73.8%) thoracic internal artery and radial artery and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in T configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
The hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
There were no complications after removal of the radial artery except for temporary paresthesia.
In the angiographic control at 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were > 50% free of stenosis.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period allows its routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic femoral fracture following knee replacement are discussed.
A new method of caring for such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has obtained a key position within neuromonitoring, although the brain pressure does not permit direct and only delayed detection of the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron.
A precondition for reliable measurement of cerebral pressure is the specific characteristics of pressure sensors, which will be examined below.
It will analyse and categorize these components from a measurement point of view in order to obtain a better understanding of their different functions and measurement characteristics.
Partial sphincterctomy is practiced in our cataract surgery in very narrow pupils (< 3 mm).
We think that the narrow pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While there is increasing research on the health-related quality of life of adults, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
This thesis examines the literature on the health-related quality of life of children in terms of research priorities and methods.
The overview shows that empirical work is scarce, and the available instruments for measuring the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are necessary to be able to use quality of life of children in prevention, health sciences, therapeutic evaluation and rehabilitation.
Seven of these patients were enrolled during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and were compared with a control group.
Because of skin changes, which, based on the present biographical material, must be considered as beginning rhinophyma, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasion in 1957.
Throughout his artistic career, the artist has been concerned with various aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the area of the nose.
As one of the founders of pop art, Warhol's body of work has significantly shaped modern society, influencing our expectations of aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen), developed specifically for 3D liver visualization, was used and evaluated for the personalized planning of extensive liver resections and live liver donations.
Experience with the programme has been gained so far for >50 volume datasets of biphasic spiral CT studies.
Since active nonspecific immunotherapy has had a positive adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival rates of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves a gene transfer which may be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, the following may be used:
Vaccination with tumour-specific HLA-associated antigens by means of peptides or " naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells in vivo with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of biased attitudes (defensiveness) in some patients on the evaluation of treatment outcomes has not been fully evaluated.
In 309 inpatients receiving conversational psychotherapy, followed up one year later, we will show the extent to which raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales are influenced by patient defenses, as measured by validity scales of the MMPI-K, FPI-R and casting test personality tests:
the tendency to portray oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to appear inconspicuously normal.
Their relative improvements (effect-weight rating scales) decrease as their openness increases (validity scales). - Stationary talk psychotherapy strengthened the defences in aggravating patients and decreased them in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequent timely surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot according to the severity of the deformity, approximately 25% of relapses and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause appears to be lack of concentric reposition and subsequent retention of the sub-articular complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
Based on the experience of 94 recurrent / residual clubfoot surgeries (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical procedure is shown.
Beyond the age of 8 to 10, midfoot osteotomies, the Ilizarov correction with the external fixator and triple arthrodesis as the ultimate ratio are used.
Nevus cells show a marked variability in their clinical morphology.
We're reporting on a 77-year-old female patient with a stymied, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on her torso.
For this grape-shaped appearance, we suggest the term "corymbiform nerve".
For ethical and socioeconomic reasons (exploding cost of transfusion, individual fate of patients), the development and consistent application of blood-saving interventions in medicine is a challenge for anaesthetists, surgeons and transfusion medicine.
The combination of several procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anesthesia method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics, and automatic autologous wound blood transfusion, make it possible, even for patients with large intraoperative blood loss, to avoid the transfusion of allogeneic blood.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Maternity Hospital and the Midwife Training Institute, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He based his research and teaching on the empirically feasible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as a midwife.
Calculating the size of the pelvis and inspecting the Michaelis tube named after him gave him a reliable forecast of the risks of the birth process.
His research was characterized by honesty and conscientiousness:
He self-critically published medical failures, critically tested new theories.
Thus, he was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis's theory on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
In despair over the death of many of his patients in childbirth, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumour may be responsible for a long- known AV block and sudden death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive, painless procedure that can produce temporary effects in humans in specific areas of the cortex.
New applications for functional-anatomical issues of language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and prior experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and safety recommendations are provided.
Neurinomas of the N. facialis are rare, benign tumors occurring mostly in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow to the extratemporal and then are noticed extracranially as space requirements.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial paralysis.
The patient presented with diffuse dizziness, progressive left hand auditory disorder, and mild peripheral facial paralysis with no deficit of tear secretion.
The neuroma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
An extradural middle fossa approach was used to remove the tumour without injury to the motor N. facialis.
This is the first report of an isolated neuroma of N. petrosus major without affect on the facial motor nerve.
A status epilepticus (SE) is a continuous seizure or a series of seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used if not.
The treatment-refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialised intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease the best course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are active substances for alternative use.
For the treatment of an obsolete rupture of the tendon of the M. tibialis anterior, either a tendon transposition or a tendon transplantation is recommended.
A case study describes the operation of augmented reversal plasticity.
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively free of complaints with good functional outcome.
The advantage of reverse plastic surgery is that, compared with the operations described so far, no functional loss is caused.
The analysis of sympathetic-vaginal balance provides valuable information on prognosis and treatment strategies for many disease models.
For the determination of this parameter in intensive care, the main approaches are the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well defined and tested in large prospective studies.
In contrast, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis for chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intense research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these medical images.
Sepsis and MODS, as conditions of particular relevance to intensive care, are also associated with impairment of autonomic function as measured by reduction of heart rate variability.
The decrease in heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be gaining increasing appeal in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We're reporting three patients with acquired green discoloration of the scalp.
The medical history showed that all three patients bathed regularly in the private swimming pool.
The examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy revealed excessive copper content as the cause of the green colour.
Based on our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair colouration and the absorption of copper by swimming water in in-house swimming pools.
The aim of this longitudinal prospective study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different time points after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, global quality of life assessment, Munich quality of life dimensions list (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx
In the evaluation, the individual measurements were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of patients with terminal heart failure rated their quality of life as very poor;
In fact, by 6 weeks post-surgery, this had improved and 74% of the transplant recipients described their quality of life as very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and health (80%) pre-operatively.
Six weeks after the transplant, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients reporting a high level of satisfaction with their health and 51% with their physical performance.
Although the patients already rated their mental well-being as good prior to HTx, this parameter improved in postoperative cases, and reached significantly higher values after one year (pre-op levels).
The range (R) = 3.78 vs. 12 months gradually.
Quality of life was best correlated with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p< 0.01), and satisfaction with health status 6 months after transplant (r=0.76, p< 0.01).
The areas of sexuality, occupational situation and leisure were improved after HTx in only about 28% of patients.
90% had one or more post-transplant complaints, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure there is a significant improvement in all areas of quality of life except the mental condition as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite high expectations and postoperative discomfort, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their post-operative life.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated craniocerebral trauma (ICT) following a bicycle accident with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma and contusion bleeding [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-consuming hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP levels required a barbiturate coma for 10 days.
Severely, the patient developed septic lung failure on the 8th day after the trauma.
The patient had a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive reduction of mobility in both hip joints (extension/ flexion:
0 degrees / 10 degrees / 20 degrees, left:
Abduction and adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
The pelvic examination and computed tomography showed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV).
The HO were removed in two stages via a Smith-Petersen access two years after the accident.
HO-Repidival prophylaxis was provided by a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/ day) for 3 months.
The movement mass at the hip joints 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection is as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction and adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiology has so far shown no recurrence of the HO.
The patient can pursue light farming activities for 3 years after the accident.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection system for dermatophytes has been developed.
The "TR1" and "TR2" primers flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
Using PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, as well as those of some yeasts and fungi, could be amplified.
Hybridisation with specific detection oligonucleotides led to the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the demarcation of the dermatophytes from the yeast and mould fungi.
The specificity of the mushroom PCR was tested using human DNA from 42 dermal and epidermal samples as well as selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were analysed by PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected by PCR in 35 and by culture in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of the culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
Wrist carthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
Wrist carthroscopy is of crucial importance in this respect in addition to functional radiology procedures.
Injury to the ulnar disc and scapuloneural ligament are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Over the past decade, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly used in forensic medicine, archaeology, and in evolutionary and population genetic studies.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA is described, with particular reference to the noncoding hypervariable regions.
The importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biology studies is also discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their size and structure are explained.
The results of experimental work to extract mitochondrial DNA from ground-deposited teeth, hair follicles and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three case studies are presented which have been resolved by mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the present work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as one's own observations.
Microperimetric studies following the surgical extraction of chorioid neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of resultant pigment epithelial loss.
The operative effort should be weighed against the possible functional outcomes of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging the intra-articular structures and surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for the diagnosis of labyrinth lesions of the hip joint.
The MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows direct imaging of labrum lesions by the distention of the articular space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three dimensional (3D) sequences allow assessment in the critical central sections of the skull.
The laboratory lesions can be classified by MRA into different clinically relevant stages.
In addition, the presentation of accompanying lesions (intra- and extra-osseous ganglia, stressed edema) is also possible.
In a study we conducted in surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
So far, more than 100 arthrographies have been carried out with no complications.
Based on this experience, MRA is the method of choice for the diagnostic imaging of labrum lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we have used.
This showed that the varicose vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the vein wall below a still intact valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and in particular the components of the extracellular matrix.
The combination of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results do not confirm the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose transformation of the vein, but rather that a change in the wall of the vein takes place first and thus valve failure also.
Injury to arteries as a direct result of trauma usually results in bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischaemia may be absent.
Hypotenal hammer syndrome is a closure of the distal A. ulnaris as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually insidious and only a specific duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to diagnosis.
There are no proven therapeutic recommendations.
The diagnosis of occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes the therapeutic approach possible.
The aim of this study is to assess mid-term eye pressure regulation following combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
Combinations of anesthesia initiation and maintenance with propofol result in a decreased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anaesthetic agents or techniques.
This article shows how to make the most of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The potential effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are discussed through results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined dental surgery and prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw by means of a translocation osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants is rarely considered in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment approach has been determined in 23 patients by the creation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with particular consideration to the aesthetics of the front teeth.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/ or prosthetic treatment plan was modified as a result of preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results.
The profile with video imaging is a useful tool in the planning of the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper mandible to take into account the interacting factors - extent of the mandibular fore displacement, direction of insertion of enossal implants, and type of supra-construction.
There are reports of a larval multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma whose unusual clinical and histological aspects initially did not permit a diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change of the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, and the lack of evidence of specific cellular organelles, were able to confirm the nature of the disease.
Among others, thymus preparations are offered on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings for thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with poor and sometimes ethically questionable design, and studies that do not permit a scientifically reasoned statement due to their short duration and the small number of patients.
A medically defensible therapy recommendation for thymoid preparations in rheumatic disorders (e. g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be derived on this basis with a sufficient benefit/ risk assessment, in conformity with the state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment at present.
We're reporting an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of A. hepatica dextra in a 64-year-old female patient.
After uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding had progressed to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to determine in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising treatment option.
Studies of the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have shown that the conditions are optimal if the early symptoms of stroke are rapidly recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 h after the onset of the first symptoms.
Precious time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or minimized by patients, relatives, or witnesses.
Increasing this number is to be achieved by intensified training activities involving both the public and the emergency medical personnel.
The standard of care in acute care includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and treatment of hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia.
In a 24- week study of maintenance treatment with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with oral methadone in 40 opiate addicts.
In the randomised trial, the retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the study for the entire study period and who completed it as planned), supplement consumption and duration of stay were defined as the target parameters.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean daily dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a trend in the retention rate (p=0.06) in favour of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine group (n=20) tended to be higher, with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone group (n=20).
For the supplemental use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, there was no significant difference between the two over the course of treatment.
Methadone was found to be the more successful substance in terms of duration of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and significant are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiation therapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the likelihood of developing haematological metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal cancer were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and were evaluated for clinical parameters, reflexothalgia, prevalent structure of tumor growth, T category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In accordance with the regimen, radical neck dissection was performed in 25/139 patients after completion of radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were subsequently treated with an operation of rattrappage.
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%) the disease was locoregionally controlled.
The tumour was not controlled in 62/ 139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with local cured tumours, were comparable in Karnofsky index, age, sex, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and number of concurrent chemotherapy cycles.
Tumour control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexothalgia (p < 0.0078), growth pattern (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time in patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/ 62) of locally uncontrolled patients compared with only 4/77 (5%) of locally cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau at 24 months.
Locoregional tumour control, as determined by several clinical parameters, is a key indicator of the likelihood of distant metastasis.
The failure of therapy is due to the biological aggressiveness of the tumour.
The introduction of multi-dose-Detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice is a new dimension in the volume and time/location resolution in CT.
However, the new technical capabilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated for the symptoms and current treatment of viper bite (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of some threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning for more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of serious poisoning is very low.
Part II discusses the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of knee distal extensional restorative and reconstructive procedures.
The MPT fixture was fitted in mounting A in 44 patients and in mounting B in 23 patients.
Four patients developed deep infection, two of which were caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
Follow-up included 5 patients with partial patellectomy and transverse patellar ligament refixation in caudal scrap fractures and 12 patients with transverse patellar ligament suture refixation with ablation and rupture of the lower patellar pole or intraligamental rupture of the patellar ligament and no other knee joint care other than stretch-relief.
The IKDC scores were rated as normal in 2 patients, almost normal in 10 patients, and abnormal in 4 patients.
Iso-kinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a 10-20% decrease in muscular strength in the operated leg compared to the opposite side.
To sum up, the EPTT with the MPT fixator has been successful in reestablishing continuity in the distal extensor system of the knee joint and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial suturing with wire or synthetic tape.
Thromboembolic disorders of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic possibilities and the development of diagnostic algorithms are now making it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies that have been investigated in clinical trials.
Based on the case history of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure and possibly eye involvement in children, is presented.
In areas exposed to light, numerous haemorrhagic blisters appear acutely at the beginning of the light-rich season and recur until adulthood, which heal rapidly.
In a field test, we gathered experience in the use of the MEDICUS tele-radiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and internal medicine, urology and gynaecology clinics.
The main type of imaging for x-ray diagnostics of oral, maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic image.
The reduction of dose requirements has also been made possible by advances in instrumentation technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or storage films.
Diagnostic weaknesses of conventional imaging methods make computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging necessary for many clinical problems in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although nuclear spin tomography is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now allows the imaging of cortical changes due to the reduction in measurement times.
For certain problems, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine methods provide imagery-assisted functional analysis.
It is now used in the hospital and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients with impaired body awareness, who have limited emotionality, or who are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy due to conflicts in their personalities.
The most common methods used today are given with brief examples and other methods are mentioned.
Among the factors cited are the link of affect to the vegetative and voluntary nervous system and the close connection between mental and physical processes, especially at the beginning of life, which is linked to the form of interaction experienced and has psycho-biological effects.
In further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and therapeutic importance.
The relationship between body-oriented methods and verbal psychotherapy, especially with psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Empirical research approaches are highlighted.
Psychotherapists live in a tension between family ideal and reality, which has been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although the activity of psychotherapy gives an individual wide scope for finding a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for female psychotherapists, to create a family model suitable for them and their partners.
Three models are presented and described in their effects.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic work on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
In their training and development, psychotherapists should give the same attention to their personal relationships as to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
The prevalence of advanced heart failure is increasing in the cardiovascular disease population with a prevalence of 0.1%.
The 6- to 12-month survival rate is significantly reduced at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice in medication refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and necessitates a more restrictive listing for heart transplants.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have been developed.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anti-congestive-acting beta-blockers.
Surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assisted hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction surgery, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These treatment options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium- to long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The selection of suitable patients for the treatment depends critically on the success of treatment.
This requires the compilation of risk scores based on national and international patient registers.
In the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopaedic University Hospital in Bochum, the incidence of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapeutic procedures over the period of one year.
By contrast, 122 manual therapeutic procedures were carried out on HWS, BWS and LWS by the respective doctors having completed further training.
While TLA focused on the main site of disease (pseudoradicular HWS and LWS syndromes), manual therapy focused on adverse events on other spinal days in patients with these diagnoses or who had a postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated mandible tooth from its implant to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report we present the case of the migration of a retinated lower premolar to the processus muscularis, documented over a period of 14 years.
Migration along the ascending mandibular artery to the muscle continuum was after the completion of root growth, after the age of 20 years.
There were no specific radiological or clinical reasons for such extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer and of cases curable by radical prostate cytoelectomy is increasing.
The detailed pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis and the further clinical treatment.
The absence of a standardized method for the processing of medicinal products internationally makes it difficult to compare different scientific studies.
The well-defined, rational assessment of the preparations we propose should address these problems and help to improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The rapid increase in the demand for documentation, performance recording, profitability and quality control require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
In the orthopaedic clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Gießen, a client-server-based OP planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992 and has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, special consideration has been given to the clinical and scientific requirements of the clinical practitioner.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, surgical scheduling (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinical communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
The simultaneous integration of the WEB server into MedXS allows content and functions to be simultaneously accessed from the intranet or the Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
The use of the application has facilitated clinical procedures and has created much better conditions for budgetary negotiations with the health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterised by nonspecific neurological symptoms and mainly facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leucodermias (piebaldism, partial albinism) is relatively typical and usually indicative.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a significant cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially in young patients.
The focus of therapy is on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prevention of sudden cardiac death.
In individual patients with severe and progressive ARVCM, there is manifest heart failure that is medically managed according to standard therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method to examine a tumour for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal level.
The issue of the need for a patella replacement in knee replacement is still very controversial.
In this context, there is a need to obtain more information on the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just comparing it with a prosthetic patella.
The fact that we have been providing patella replacements for almost 5 years only in special cases has given us a patient population available on which to study this issue.
Using 30 fully prosthetic knee joints followed for two years, we have carried out a targeted study of the patellar cartilage and the tendon first on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patella gyrus and correlated the results to the range of motion achieved after two years and to persistent pain symptoms.
An adaptation of the bony patella to the prosthetic placenta was regularly observed with compression of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous layer of placement;
7 patients were classified as a'residual problem group' based on their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/ extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases of postoperative shift greater than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases of postoperative tilt greater than 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, also significantly different from the no problem group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility were correlated with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the knee-joint (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After axial corrective replacement of the tibial components, this patient also recovered free from complaints and became highly mobile without surgical intervention on the patella and although considerable residual stiffness remained.
Thus it is concluded that a greater effort is justified for re­centering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm:
In addition to routine surgical procedures that help in reversing the development of the knee discs, high transposition of the quadriceps or medial refixation of the detached tuberosity may be required.
However, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, as the nonprosthetically supported patella demonstrates an amazing adaptability to the prosthetic smooth pad by remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative dislocation, in which no replacement had been performed because of the good peroperative bone quality, we had to tolerate more delayed problems even with the normal course of the kneecap.
Whether there is an extended indication for patella replacement in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance programme of the VDR and the quality assurance publications of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
By implementing a comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, quality has been measurably improved.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinical structures.
Until now, the emphasis has been on measures relating to patient needs and the development of internal treatment procedures.
In order to improve employee satisfaction and skills, rehabilitation-specific training courses have been carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives have been developed together with other partners.
Objective of the operation Avoid or remove compression on the nerve structures.
This paper provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results will be discussed.
It is known that there is an increased incidence of respiratory chain defects in the onocytic cells of the parathyroid gland and also of the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It is likely that oncocytic metaplasia is pathogenetically distinct from oncocytic neoplasia.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasia.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly found in the thyroid while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient on prolonged parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes in this patient are due to a zinc deficiency in the body.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
We compare 53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with eczema, and a skin-healthy sample of 52 subjects to their sexual behaviour.
The testing procedure used questionnaires on sexual behaviour according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership.
The dermatitis patients studied differ significantly from those with healthy skin in terms of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of affection is very significantly reduced in both sexes, and the ability to orgasm is very significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatic patients are more affected than those with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with eczema have never been consulted by their physician about their sex lives.
However, despite the difficulty of addressing this intimate area, the doctor who treats skin and venereal diseases should be a competent contact person for matters concerning skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
The conventional radiograph must still be regarded as the basic test for the clinical diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential covers not only bone inflammatory destructions but also allows the evaluation of their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image via collateral phenomena may indicate a clinical flare and may directly and indirectly illustrate the inflammatory increase in volume of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, particularly by means of the detailed presentation of cortical bone structures - complementary to MR, in some specific issues, particularly at the femoral skeleton and at individual large joints, provides highly specific information, partly for definitive diagnosis and partly for operative planning.
This includes the cruciate colon joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper HWS.
Treatment of open fractures of the lower leg grade II and III with simultaneous soft tissue damage involves today a wide range of surgical options of primary osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the unbored marking nail and on to primary bone shortening followed by callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of the soft covering.
Only by the successes associated with these techniques was it possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the high rate of amputations and infections.
Although these were first isolated cases, there was an increase in the incidence of soft tissue problems in the lower leg, ranging from recurrent swelling to ulcer.
A clinical study using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and comparing with 50 healthy subjects, showed that more than 50% of all patients suffered clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage is shown from a simple swelling to the ulcer of the crus, and is of increasing clinical relevance with increasing distance from the accident.
In order to avoid further damage, including iatrogenic damage, strict adherence to the surgical guidelines in primary care is necessary and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformity of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of limb shape and function.
Muzines are highly glycosylated glycoproteins containing a variety of carbohydrate and/ or peptide sequences of antigenic determinants.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry has provided extensive information on their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues have been described.
A number of recent findings also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumour biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
This paper provides, including its own findings, an overview of gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
The establishment of rheumatology centres in Germany has in recent years brought about a networking of out-patient and inpatient settings with their resident general practitioners, internal and orthopaedic rheumatologists, patient physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists, as well as acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatology focal points can, in the long term, help further improve cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of patients with rheumatism and to provide a continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic patients, in terms of quantitative and qualitative comprehensive rheumatological quality management.
Despite the increasing incidence of medical problems, there is little knowledge about the nature and frequency of treatment errors following thyroid surgery.
The analysis of a collective of 21 515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the Medical Associations of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the period under review.
In 36 cases (16%) the expert committees found errors in treatment.
The complaint concerned 95% of surgeons, 2% of anaesthetists, 3% of both disciplines and once an ENT doctor.
Of the complaints, 90% were related to complications following routine thyroid surgery.
Surgery-like complications such as recurrence spares (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postbleeding (3%) and late recurrence (1%), together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), residual nodules (4%), and scarring problems (5%) accounted for 37% of complaints but 70% of treatment failures.
Educational deficiencies were present in only 11% of the treatment errors identified.
Treatment error was found most commonly when reoperation was required (p < 0.001), when the objective of surgery was not achieved (p < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by a post-treatment error (p < 0.001).
The field of environment and health is characterised by its interdisciplinary nature and the resulting high level of communication.
To complicate matters, there are sometimes significant problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this field.
Recognised indications include bilateral renal tumours, renal tumours in patients with functional and anatomical individual kidneys and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis following tumour nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Improvements in surgical strategy - such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery can also prevent more than 95% of patients with multiple and advanced renal tumours from having a nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving renal tumour surgery in imperative indications, an increasing number of centres are recommending the extension of parenchymal sparing renal tumour surgery to a selected population with contralaterally healthy kidneys (selective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinoma of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears to be small.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrence is in most cases infaustous.
Carcinomas-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has been most commonly described in small cell bronchial carcinoma.
We report 3 female patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or cervical uterine carcinoid.
Background and question.
To develop rational treatment guidelines, pathogenicity and resistance status of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases were assessed.
Combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognised standard for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective, but it has very few side effects.
The following is a report of a patient who reported significant prolonged hyperpigmentation in the healed psoriatic lesions on this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
Different lithotriptors have been developed on largely the same technical principles.
The discussion focused on the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the likelihood of recurrence, which further make a corresponding metaphylaxis useful.
While side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in conjunction with other therapies are still pending.
Acute corneal calcification has been observed on an isolated clinical basis following treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior part of the eye with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).
The previously unknown pathomechanism led us to the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy following in vitro fertilisation (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case study, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
Various options are being discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
Using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and represented by silver staining on a polyacrylamide gel after restriction digestion.
The following allele frequencies were found in a southwestern German population:
Allele A is 0.2704, allele B is 0.0741 and allele 0 is 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 subjects (3.57%), the analysis method chosen here, which only considers the nucleotide positions 261 and 703 showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype because the differentiation between the A and 02-alleles is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic examination.
The need for exceptions is illustrated by the following case studies.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patella facette after a football game.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, bony, translocated haematoma, which easily adheres to a wood:
It appeared that at the football game, there had been a hematoma due to a bruise or a subluxation of the patella.
The boy was fine after the arthroscopy, the muscle atrophy returned rapidly.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and long-lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data suggesting a longer term effect (more than one year) are presented.
Recent studies clearly demonstrate a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammatory therapy from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these more recent studies also provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological processes of the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are loosely linked by the underlying causes of RA but develop to some extent independently of each other.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids might relate to different mechanisms presented elsewhere in this symposium.
Ejaculating sperm and spermatogenesis cells express the 1-, 3- and 4-integrins and their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show marked intra- and interindividual variation and different locations on the sperm surface.
The nested polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To date, it is unclear whether AMs are of functional relevance to the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells, or are simply 'biological redundancy' or the final insurance.
The marking of sperm MA was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a multifunctional hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors.
The secretion of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an evening rise and peak between 2 and 4 a. m.
In addition, independent of a receptor system, through its strong lipophily properties, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely across cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in extra- and intracellular space.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin disorders, such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, and malignant melanoma.
Another aspect is the effect of melatonin on hair growth.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There is some knowledge of the cutaneous penetration and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals which allow a focus of inflammation to be identified in a vague focus, given the possibility of whole body imaging and SPECT technology, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which enable for example evidence of leukocyte infiltration.
Both approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which involve an inflammatory sintigraphy if the finding is unclear.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treatment for infant capillary haemangiomas.
However, surprisingly, there are no detailed studies to support their efficacy in tumours that regularly undergo spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary mechanical brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial space requirements due to post-traumatic hemorrhage and ulcerations, and the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
In both isolated SHT and in post-multitrauma with and without brain injury, a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to mono- or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual components of injury and impairment are usually survivable, but in combination and cumulation they can be fatal.
Hypermetabolic states following an SHT are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of SHT on the rest of the body need to be contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries in a polytraumatized victim on brain function, whereby shock-induced perfusion disturbances can cause a prognosis-limited hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
Knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the organism as a whole and of the influence of current therapeutic interventions is still incomplete and needs further clarification.
Lastly, it is from this point of view that the choice of the appropriate time for secondary interventions, which are not directly life-saving and lead to an additional burden on the patient as a result of the trauma of the operation, must be reconsidered.
This paper attempts to summarise important aspects in this area.
In order to distinguish between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, as well as for the early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and more recently also human kalicrine 2 (hK2), have proven to be valuable decision aids.
Children with facial cleft have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart failure varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 adults and examined for notable personality traits.
They were also asked on a questionnaire their personal reasons for leaving.
Erythroceroatolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin, has been described as a hereditary dermatosis with partly cirrhotic scaly erythema, predominantly manifest in early childhood, particularly in families from the Oudtshoorn district of South Africa.
The seasonal attachment to the winter semester and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We're demonstrating clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings from a 4-year-old female patient that are well-matched to erythroceratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area were not available.
17 Studies on the efficacy of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondyloarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), and localised and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for both results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the work reviewed reveals clear deficiencies.
The aim of this study was to examine whether the visual acuity decreases with time of exposure and whether this regulation puts normal persons and nystagmus patients at a disadvantage in the driving test.
Sudeck syndrome is a condition that affects a limb after microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to injury or surgery of a limb.
His theory was not accepted, as most of the medical community believes that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted a number of clinical and experimental studies and also investigated the effects of antiphlogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
The study presents methods for the application of rapid, multilayer spiral CT for cardiac imaging by means of ECG synchronized spiral acquisition.
Computer tomography allows, in addition to the radiological techniques used in dentistry, a non-overlapping picture of the upper and lower jaws.
In addition to the established use of CT in malignancies, its application has proved its worth in other areas.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1,5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jaw bone and the damage caused by retinated teeth to permanent teeth can be assessed, enabling early treatment.
If the periodontal fissure of the retinated tooth can be delineated, orthodontic placement is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental disease, the horizontal and vertical bone loss should be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space requirements can be detected by CT.
Prior to an intended implantologic treatment, therapy may be optimized by careful consideration of the remaining bone matter and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants may be specified.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
Case examples describe the symptoms of SE.
Key symptom is a lapse of consciousness to coma.
The cranial CT scan is also usually normal and generalised brain edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the magnitude of which is correlated with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defence reactions of the organism to bacterial products and the bacteremia itself are important etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in the amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors, such as electrolyte changes, hyperthermia, hypoglycaemia, shock and ischemia, and liver and kidney failure may contribute to the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate therapy of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE is of special diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Endogenous endophthalitis in severe general disease and reduced general condition has a very poor prognosis, despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy.
Movies are stories.
What is particularly exciting here are the scenes in which people are faced with conflicting decisions.
Medical ethics conflicts appear not only in medical series or disease profiles, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
You know, comedies, westerns, romance, crime and gangster movies.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films can tap into moral values and also act as seismographs for the societal relevance of medical ethical issues.
However, in film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the presented conflict situations is similar to a case review in medical ethics and is a useful complement to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in residual rates compared to conventional PTCA has led to stent implantation becoming the most common initial intervention.
In-stent restenosis, therefore - particularly the long-term form - is a major clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty in these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the emergency services.
In addition to the initial treatment of the injured person, the initial care of the amputee in case of amputation often determines the success of the recovery measures.
The primary objective of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is the analysis of submucosal structures that are inaccessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
Consequently, it is a general rule to carry out diagnostic imaging of the larynx in the knowledge of the results of the endoscopic diagnosis.
The topographical and anatomical conditions of the skeleton, the internal structures and the environment of the larynx will be represented synoptically.
By a transpedicular stabilisation with a screw ring belt system the instability was removed with segmental function preservation.
In recent years, new knowledge has been gained about post-traumatic changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the related pathophysiological links.
In addition to corresponding changes in the management of neurotraumatology-intensive care medicine, this has led to the development of drugs designed to reduce the incidence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
This work considers the emerging findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the main possibilities of pharmacological intervention.
While some drugs are already in clinical use, others are at various stages of experimental and clinical trials.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with advanced disease are a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trophosphamide on the disease course of melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for pulmonary silicosis for over 3 years before developing asymptomatic black spots on his face.
The other patient developed gray-black patches on both lower legs due to folliculitis after only 6 months of taking minocycline.
A trial treatment with the rubin laser resulted in re-establishment of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed in the case studies.
Objective of operation Removal of the deformity of the digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have in recent years led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
A key factor is the recovery of neuronal capacity.
This study examined the sensitive regenerative capacity of N. alveolaris inferior following partial surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascularized N. thoracicus longus.
Sensation of pressure and pain could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration as early as 5 months, and thermal stimuli as early as 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly stimulated N. thoracicus longus is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the N. alveolaris inferior in tumour patients.
The use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) is the most common cause of intentional overdose in the United States and the United Kingdom, although only a relatively small number of serious complications result in a large number of overdoses.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient who has been given standard dose exceeding the minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a patient weighing 60 kg).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, a complete regimen of N-acetylcysteine should be administered to any patient whose degree or timing of overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be continued if liver function deteriorates.
Specialist advice should be sought at the first signs of severe hepatotoxicity to ensure optimal therapy or prompt referral in the event of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has considerably improved the lot of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between hospitals and specific liver disease facilities.
Background and question.
Itching is a difficult-to-treat side effect of many dermatoses and internal diseases.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
When applied topically, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated polymodal C and A nerve fibres after an initial stage of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic test sore represents a problematic urological condition both in terms of diagnosis and treatment.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40% respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for therapeutically refractory testicular algia.
12 patients were operated on by sperm cell neurolysis following adequate environmental diagnosis:
The M. cremastericus is dissected by means of bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of A. testicularis is removed under microsurgery under a pathway length of 2 - 3 cm.
At a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) were free of symptoms.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our operative method can only be maintained with the exact indication, so that it is essential to have accurate environmental diagnostics to exclude a specific genesis of the test algae.
Neurosurgery also faces a trend towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid major trepanations and minimise the preparatory trauma to the brain, spinal cord and nerves, and thereby to minimise the risk of neurological and psychological disorders.
Hospital stays and incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
The main "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
The brain, with its preformed cavities, ventricles, and subarachnoid space, provides excellent conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic intervention is closed hydrocephalus.
But also arachnoidal cysts, cystic tumors, and smaller intraventricular space requirements can be effectively treated endoscopically through a small drill hole.
By the use of special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes such as cavernous sinuses can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal disorders and carpal tunnel syndrome, and as an adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by means of diffusion weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body permastasis and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the tissue specific ADC, which corresponds to the intrinsic diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
A low ADC is to be expected in cell-rich tumour tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i. e. diffusion barriers) and a high ADC in lean or necrotic tissue.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanotic lung tumour, which completely occluded the left main bronchus and had its base in the bronchus of the left subclavian.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lung was performed.
Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumour was classified as malignant melanoma.
There was no history of prior removal of any skin, mucous membrane or eye changes.
The targeted examinations of the skin and eye also provided no evidence of a primary tumour localised there.
Hence, the new formation is considered as a primary respiratory malignant melanoma, of which 21 cases have been confirmed thus far.
The patient is tumour-free after a relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far there is no experience of twilight vision after LASIK.
So we looked at twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has become a standard method for noninvasive diagnosis of ischemia.
With ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging identical pharmacological stress protocols to those currently used in echocardiography can be performed.
HLA-DR antigen from the cornea are lost during organ culture storage.
The work examined whether this is downregulation of the HLA-DR antigen or loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans (LZ) cells.
DNA cytometry has become a routine diagnostic technique, preferably used in breast cancer to assess the plaidiology and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry because of its lower validity.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, firstly, the S-phase and the proliferation index, and secondly, the ploidy, are important factors in prognostication and treatment planning.
Precise knowledge of the method and of the possibility of error is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for the determination of proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information should be considered unclear at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric analyses and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
In the case of cervical syndromes, injection therapy is of major importance.
This article will cover the general requirements and the various practical procedures for injecting the injection.
Summary The coverage of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear and the question of coverage by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations concerning disease prevention (Section 20 of the SGB V), medical care (Section 23 of the SGB V) and the health examination (Section 25 of the SGB V) are not to be considered as a legal basis for the costs.
The PEP is treatment for ill health within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, due to the lack of appropriate recommendations by the Federal committees.
It would be desirable to adopt appropriate recommendations soon, in order to remove the legal uncertainty in this area.
The obligation to bear the costs may be possible under the principles of the legal form of the so-called new methods of investigation and treatment.
As such, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP need to be specified and cleared of ambiguities with regard to indication and mode of administration.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the Austrian and German recommendations, this will not be a treatment error as there is still too much uncertainty from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
The organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR positive Langerhans corneal cells.
The previous work examines the importance of prolonged corneal storage time for the success of a perforating keratoplasty.
Based on its own experience with 3D echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct transfontal ultrasonographic studies in three dimensions and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent adverse event in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin for Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old female patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive care followed by 72 days of respiration, developed heterotopic ossifications on five major joints, with nearly complete rigidity.
The reason for the intensive care was a double transplant in severe pulmonary hypertension.
The re-erection of the ossification in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow and both hip joints has restored mobility.
Heterotope ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatic, after spinal cord injury, after SHT, in intoxication and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, it is assumed that a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts, which then cause bone formation.
The diagnosis is made by means of imaging techniques.
Prophylactic drug treatment may be given using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), on whom we used argon laser for topical therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that were not or only slightly affected by established treatment strategies.
Following application of the argon laser, the area of the treated lesions was completely and permanently healed.
Histological and immunohistological evidence suggest that vascular mediated effects of the argon laser are relevant to the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
These case studies are the first to demonstrate the efficacy of the argon laser in the treatment of treatment-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common overall indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Re-infection with hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favourable prognosis compared to HBV re-infection.
Efficient prophylaxis of reinfection in hepatitis C has not yet been established and extensive studies are still needed.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for transplantation is more unfavourable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are very rare.
We discuss this entity on the basis of a case study and the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumours is surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiation therapy.
The exception is rhabdomyosarcoma, which also responds well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in preexcitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative potential.
Accidental conduction pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodrome or antidrome reentry tachycardia of varying incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in the tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitation conduction system and the detection of additional paraspecific fibres are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Anomalies of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and co-morbid heart conditions should be evaluated by echocardiography prior to intervention and, if appropriate, at the beginning of the intervention with contrast imaging.
In 300 patients with inherited variants of the preeccitation syndrome, independent outcomes of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a higher quality record of the occurrence of complications in orthopaedics and to have comparable statistics over many years, standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is required.
Since 1 January 1997, the Foundation Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg has kept a complete, consolidated register of all early complications of all hospitalised patients.
The complications are prospectively recorded in a complication programme by the medical profession according to a standardized classification and the data is checked, corrected and supplemented and classified by the clinic's quality management department.
The guide is intended to contribute to the discussion of a standard in the identification and evaluation of orthopaedic complications with the aim of reaching consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterised by the appearance of blisters in the acromion region at an advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
The pathophysiological basis would appear to be a disruption of dermoepidermal coherence in the course of treatment, manifested clinically by mechanical stress in the form of brittle blisters.
Acrobullous photodermatosis should be differentiated from phototoxic reactions due to excessive UVA irradiation or excessive concentration of psoralen.
Two cases illustrate the clinical, pathophysiological and differential diagnosis of this disease.
Apart from autopsy confirmed findings of fibrolipomatosis of the right ventricular myocardial replacement, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplastic cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994 criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological features, divided into main and secondary criteria.
The following study will assess the validity of the criteria using a group of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France.
Global or segmental right ventricular dilation as primary criteria was detected by angiography or echocardiography in 20 patients (83%).
4 patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of right ventricular segmental kinetic disorders.
In all patients, typical fibrolipomatosis of the right ventricular myocardium was detected histologically.
T inversions in right precordial derivatives were present as secondary criteria in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS spread of greater than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as primary endpoints.
Late potential analysis by means of signal-measuring ECG was available in only 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) for secondary criteria.
Left femoral block chamber tachycardia, which was classified as an adverse event, was detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died without evidence of arrhythmias due to progressive right heart failure.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family was used as a secondary endpoint in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The developed taskforce criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD resulted in the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, but the importance of assured histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without the inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was made in only 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favourable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria will make a purely clinical diagnosis more likely.
There is clear evidence that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycaemia on cerebral ischemia is controversial.
The contradictory results from clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained by looking at different types of stroke separately and taking into account the time course of blood glucose during the acute event.
Hyperglycaemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia when insufficient collateral supply is present.
In addition, the risk of haemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, an acute increase in glucose levels by improving substrate supply may protect nerve tissue from structural damage if there is only a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow.
This situation exists in the area of the penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative as well as the positive effects of acute hyperglycaemia are dependent on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epileptic surgical diagnosis following which resective epilepsy surgery was performed in 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy.
The localizing agreement of findings from non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intractal positron emission tomography (PET) and intractal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was the basis for the focusing.
78% (n=39) of the 50 patients were seizure-free or had very rare seizures.
Extraporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations when described MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, and especially temporal epilepsy, noninvasive EEG links in the preoperative diagnosis are sufficient to avoid the risk of invasive EEG studies.
Medical history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented to an outpatient clinic with a new onset of tachycardia absoluta.
Echocardiographically, there was suspicion of an intracardial space requirement, which should be further investigated by transesophageal echocardiography.
In the ECG absolute tachycardia was found with frequencies up to 146 / min, an intermittent sinus rhythm was also documented.
This was also confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large space requirement in projection on the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal edge over-arching laterally.
Due to the displacing growth of the cyst with the development of atrial rhythm disturbances and in order to safely rule out malignancy, the cyst was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then the patient has been in the sinus rhythm, complaining only of isolated "outliers", most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystole.
Primary harmless atrial dysrhythmias may also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or even intra-cardiac space requirements, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute meningitis can have a variety of causes.
A rare cause of paresis of one or more cranial nerves is dissection of A. carotis interna.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even in the case of atypical symptoms, is important as timely anticoagulation therapy may prevent stroke as a consequence of dissection-related embolism.
We report two patients with lesions of the pari-cavernous nerves (Raeder syndrome) and the caudal nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the A. carotis interna.
In addition to the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden loss of cerebrospinal nerve must be thought of as a carotid dissection.
Abnormality of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic until old age, but may manifest clinically in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of an asymptomatic 15-month-old child and the need for surgical correction.
The suspect diagnosis was made by chance in echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation involved the transplantation of the defective coronary artery without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures involving joints (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on the trauma management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical techniques for the management of articulatory fractures offers the possibility to achieve a good functional result from a small amount of soft tissue trauma caused by surgery.
The aim is to achieve at least exercise stability as compared with the standard methods.
In addition to the minor surgical soft tissue trauma, the accurate intraoperative assessment of joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intraarticular concomitant injuries are of particular advantage compared to conventional procedures.
Out of a total of 54 patients with tibial fractures, 34 patients underwent arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis at our clinic between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed good overall Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a select number of patients, we also consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be appropriate for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, following moderate traumatic brain injury, developed bilateral hypoglossal suppression without other neurological deficits that clinically completely resolved within 3 months.
Since CT scan detected no skull basal fracture in the region of the posterior cranial fossa, we discuss a bilateral rupture of the N. hypoglossus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency is a condition in which blood can no longer pump sufficiently from the veins of the legs under the conditions of daily life.
The residue propagates from the large veins, through the smallest venules, to the micro-circulatory area and ultimately affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features that can be secondarily confirmed by a simple objective measurement procedure are best used as a basis for classification principles.
Stewart's blue colour syndrome is defined as an angioedema that develops on the floor of arteriovenous short circuits.
Skin changes are usually unilateral in the lower extremities, and are similar to Kaposi' s sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain, and rarely hypertrophy of the affected limb.
The disease pattern is often rapidly progressive and results in ulcerative nodules prone to bleeding and infection.
The causal therapy is the removal of the arteriovenous shunts.
Because of the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas, surgery is rarely possible.
Superselective embolization is more appropriate, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
This is the report on the successful use of eight embolization procedures in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart' s blue-colored syndrome.
Up until now, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary skin histiocytosis was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granule) and freezing (CD1a) immunohistology in addition to clinical and histology on the H&E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffinic markers now allow a (also retrospective) treatment and accurate classification of these diseases on formalinfected material.
Antibodies to S-100 protein and the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) can be used to differentiate classic Langerhans cell histiocytocyte (LZH) cells from other histiocytic cell systems.
There were not up to date uniform electron optical and immunohistological characteristics of non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LZH).
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of major importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
The frequencies and distributions of the different monocyte/ macrophage and dendritic cells and their responses to the corresponding parafangic markers of immunohistochemistry may vary widely within different clinical entities.
Diagnostic significance as distinct from the Langerhans cell histiocytes appear to be antibodies to factor XIIIa (shown in the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in the juvenile Xanthogranulom).
Both markers show a positive pattern of reaction with the epithelial cells typical of the disease process.
Below, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of treatment with allopurinol and re-exposure to allopurinol.
A malignant bladder cancer (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner ulcer for 10 years.
To date, 7 case reports of non-bilharzia-associated recurrent bladder carcinoma have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of uremic bladder cancer as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of bladder cancer appears to be chronic bladder irritation.
After exhausting the conservative therapy options, the radical cystectomy and supravesical urethral drainage were performed.
'NoToX Histological Fixative' is offered as a replacement for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examination.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistological staining, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used.
In this research, which was carried out independently at three different sites, it was shown that tissue samples fixed with NoToX exhibit no differences from formalinfected tissue samples with regard to the reproducibility of conventional staining or the visibility of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
To describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and the open air axis dose are typically used.
The CTDI, and the MSAD derived from it, is a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the volume of the test, but a poor measure of the doses relevant from the point of view of the physician and patient, according to the sensitivity of the organs to radiation and the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose allowing an estimation of risk.
The indication of an upper limit for the Axis dose should take into account the dose requirements of the test area in order to ensure acceptable image quality and to avoid unnecessary risk.
As physical quantities, all three quantities are useful for characterization and differentiation of different study programmes and apparatus with respect to radiation exposure.
Following a report by the World Heart Federation/ International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle disease was broadened in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been included in this definition.
Therefore a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses, appear to be important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory cardiomyopathy and ventricular dilation.
It seems reasonable to put shame, as a universal human emotion, in a separate category from guilt.
In addition to its defensive nature, the "self-sustaining" function of shame should also be considered.
The appearance of shame always indicates the protection of self-esteem, even if it should not be detectable in the patient.
The signalling nature of shame is discussed and the question whether shame symptoms have a pathological value is considered.
The attention to psychogenesis and the unconscious dynamics of shame enlarges the view of potentially embarrassing situations in therapy.
This review gives an overview of the literature on the focus on treatment of acute psychosocial crises, which is highly heterogeneous both in terms of understanding of the crisis and therapeutic methods and in terms of professional competence.
In particular, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents over the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as relevant to crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune systems in its pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a decreased density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
is an increased programmed cell death (apoptosis).
Coronary artery dissection samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL for fragmented DNA) and electron microscopically.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.
In an in vivo study and in specially fixed cadavers, using techniques developed by Thiel in 1992, it was investigated the position of the transversal fascia in relation to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In TEP, the fascia may be used as reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as a backfill for fixing of the foreign material (net) to the side of the artery.
We are introducing two patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scales led to the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be excluded in both cases.
It is believed that the treatment of eczema for months by means of immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Haemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The efficacy of haemoglobin solutions for O2 transport, and in particular for the effective delivery of O2 to tissues, has been demonstrated in a wide range of situations such as extreme haemodilution and haemorrhagic shock.
Genetic and chemical modifications can stabilize the hemoglobin molecule.
This results in a clinically viable intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity and no nephrotoxicity.
A certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as a residual side effect of the haemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Nevertheless, haemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with very high gas solubility and are thus well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme haemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also during resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the emergency care of the injured.
A launch is expected in the next few years.
It is based strictly on clear physical laws and defined physiological regularities.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, in which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving therapy or an important, often decisive component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive care unit.
Among potential side effects, besides barotrauma of the lungs, the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication must be considered.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a focused and critical indication, and the ability and skills to safely manage emerging complications with intensive or emergency medical interventions.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation, with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive care character, should therefore be an additional area of interest for the anaesthetist.
Our interest is in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues in the context of oncological therapy.
In this work the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarised.
The preliminary results give cause for hope that ultrasound, because of its good depth-focusing properties, could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for sound-enabled tumours.
The experimentally observed ultrasonic induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasonic parameters.
New results show that nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for the online monitoring of ultrasonically induced high temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive CT temperature measurement may become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumours be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
The long-term effects of prematurity on ocular and ENT status should be demonstrated in a group of extremely small preterm infants.
At the University Orthopaedic Clinic Homburg/Saar, since 1993, a computer system has been used for surgical and outpatient documentation and to support the general clinical organization.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures as required by the GSG.
Since its introduction, the system has included data from 31,500 patients and 8,500 surgeries.
The flexibility of the software allows both medical and administrative requirements to be taken into account.
An additional clinical network at the University Hospital Homburg enables inter-departmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks and the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centres on the usual pre- and post-operative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to investigate whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
It also mentions non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with current compensation practices.
The purpose of the study in ovine animals was to determine whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and unsulfated glycosaminoglycans demonstrated a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthritic injury, whether a temporal allocation occurred and whether the results allowed a sustained use of GAGs as a prognostic criterion or as an arthrosis marker.
The 21 sheep are randomized into 3 groups of 7 animals:
The controls are the knee joints of the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological scores between the TD vs. ME and MV groups differed statistically significantly (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, HA is significantly higher in the ME and MV groups.
In CS there is a significantly elevated level (p < 0.01) for measurement 6 months postoperatively in the ME group and one year after partitioning.
Clinical effects:
The HA level allows a possible description of the degree of arthrosis, at least experimentally, to a certain extent.
Concentrations increase with longer postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
Blocker therapy is considered the standard of care for symptomatic patients.
In cases of therapy failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockade may be considered as an option.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
The article presents additions and use of an epidiascope which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ discs in the courses of general and special pathology, and saves costly video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older age and are of far-reaching importance.
These problems are referred here to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the point of view of the increasing discrepancy between the ego and the ego ideal in age.
Pathological exacerbations of the ageing process, often seen in elderly patients, are shown in three aspects.
Narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are then described and options and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The results of the Mitchel muscle energy technique for spinal disorders are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the muscle energy technique.
The therapy is highly successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is without risk to the patient.
It is an alternative to pulse chiropractic techniques.
We report on a 26-year-old female patient with herpetiform dermatitis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complained of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhoea and symptoms of sicca.
Clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of the duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in the diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjogren's syndrome.
In our view, a common occurrence of these various pathologies has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease may be considered as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological pathologies.
In developed countries, medical conditions are more likely to contribute to malnutrition than lack of food.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the elderly population, affecting 5-12% of those living independently, 30-61% of those hospitalized and 40-85% of those in long-term care centres.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic approach to clarify its causes.
Increased clinician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important for the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The light microscopy comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/ compound neoplasms showed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
These are: radial digitalis, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster plaster-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like peripheral zones and the so-called blue-in-pink areas
However, specific light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumour is based on several combined individual features suspected of malignancy.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy in cartilage regeneration.
Commonly used vector transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists is providing new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Initial clinical feasibility studies involving the transfer of such a gene (IRAP) are an important step towards the establishment of clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for the correction of hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experience with unidirectional and bidirectional distractants in both intra- and extra-oral administration in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic disease patterns.
The results were 1 boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia with Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Rodger syndrome and 1 rare case of midline defect with 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with bone gains of 6-28 mm achieved.
Older people interested in continuing education are increasingly recognising the diverse possibilities which the Internet offers in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further education and adult education institutions are required to facilitate the access of older people to the world of digital media, to support them in the acquisition of media skills and to develop attractive virtual learning experiences for them.
Based on the experience of the 'Senior Info Mobile' information campaign, it describes how to give people over 50 access to the new communication technologies.
The example of the European Learning in Later Life (LiLL) network and other projects further illustrates how spatially and temporally dissociated "inquiry learning" among older adults in the form of virtual working groups and networks could serve as an engine for a 'new learning culture' that includes those who do not live in close proximity to a university or further education establishment or cannot participate in on-site activities for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MRI has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, the invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MRI angiography.
The rapid technical development of MRI has in recent years also opened up the possibility of new functional examination techniques.
MRI of the heart is characterised by the combination of simultaneous detection of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive method without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, the Cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in a single test.
MR spectroscopy is the only technique that offers insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of cardiac MRI.
MRI is the only diagnostic procedure which allows a complete analysis of heart disease in a single examination, both as an initial and as a followup examination.
The rapid development will overcome limitations in the foreseeable future, notably in the field of MR coronary angiography.
An overview is given of 30 years of development of documentation and computers at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg.
Since its establishment in 1967, it has undergone four stages of development:
the initial medical initiatives, the establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic planning of information systems, the setting-up of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus management of the performance of services.
Planning and implementation were carried out in accordance with the general plans and concepts of the University Hospital of Baden-Württemberg.
We report the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac massage.
This is the first published case.
We're reporting bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation into an iliac artery with consequent septic embolism, ipsilateral knee empem and formation of an infected spurial aneurysm.
The cause must be assumed to be Staphylococcus aureus contamination of the stent.
The treatment was resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem of a six-year-old boy with a type II cleft foot with oligodactyly and clenodactyly of the second toe.
This review article looks at the current state of controversy surrounding the patella back flap replacement indication.
The present state of experimental and biomechanical knowledge is described, as are the technical features of the various types of implants and the special features of the patella preparation.
Moreover, the author goes over the major clinical studies on the subject of patellar surface replacement and attempts to give the reader criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for back area replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for patellar back area replacement could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes of the migration and loosening behaviour of hip joint prostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to altered rigidity and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is commonly seen after organ transplantation in adults as a consequence of treatment with the hypertensive medicinal products cyclosporine A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
There are few studies on the behaviour of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" refers to the absence of visible signs of fracture on conventional radiography carried out at the initial diagnosis, and yet fracture is still present.
Diagnosis can only be made in the course of or by means of further diagnosis.
However, the scintigraphy and CT scan carried out for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that allows both the early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and the diagnosis of any accompanying chondral and ligament injuries.
In this study, we report 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in five different anatomical regions, which can be diagnosed with MRI after a negative result on X-ray.
Athero-arterial embolism is an early phenomenon.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal carotid arteries gave rise to the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical picture and the need for invasive or post mortem diagnosis, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe aortic atherosclerosis.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, proximal aortic atherosclerosis is a cause of embolic complications in operations or catheterization of the aorta.
In patients with a particular form of atherosclerosis in the aorta, with stylized and mobile blood clots arising from circumscribed plaques, anticoagulants have been shown to be effective.
Embolic recurrence was prevented and a regression of thrombosis was observed.
A 62-year-old female patient with severe valgus deformity and right knee joint resistance as a result of a supracondicular hamstring fracture has been reported after osteo-synthetic intervention with dynamic condyle screw 2 years ago.
The indication was for varying and extending corrective osteotomy and retrograde femoral nail osteosynthesis.
The patient was able to exert a full load on the right lower extremity with axis alignment within the first postoperative week.
The principle of retrograde lock-up is a suitable method to achieve good and stable osteosynthesis even during correction operations.
Tear duct surgery at the University Eye Clinic of Münster in 296 children between 1987 and 1992 was studied.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectonic and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystalloid, luminal, basophilic mucus) are always suspected but are not themselves evidence of carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (core size, hyperchromatism, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) should always be evaluated in comparison with previously existing benign glands.
In any case the immunohistochemical finding with basal cell specific cytokeratin must be critically evaluated and may at best confirm or (if basal cell positive) safely exclude a cancer diagnosis.
This review summarises the various diagnostic criteria and evaluates their value for routine diagnosis.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 20 mg TNFR55-IgG1 IV for 14 days was compared with a monthly dose of 50 mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100 mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed rapid and significant improvement in all parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, an increase in the inflammatory parameters occurred despite continued administration of the test substance.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A case was reported of a 13 month old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal haemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
The healthy newborn also has the right to optimal care so that any disorders of postnatal adaptation can be detected in time.
The introduction of painless, simple and yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly facilitated the situation for all those responsible.
Background and question.
In view of the increasing reports of increases in resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in Gonococcus strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used in sports and rehabilitation for years, in which in deep water, supported by a lifting aid (vest or belt), jogging-like movements are performed.
In sports, aquajogging is used as regenerative training and "low-impact alternative training" in strength and endurance.
Aqua jogging is of particular value in rehabilitation for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for musculoskeletal disorders, and as endurance and light strength training for medical conditions.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular or prosthetic.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularisation surgery as the only causal therapy has its place in a selected patient sample.
The most important criteria are age below 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be corrected to around 53-55% against the initial short-term results of over 80%.
Venous surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic drop in long-term consequences (on average, less than 40%).
Penile prosthetic surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term survival of the implants and a patient satisfaction of 89%.
However, the irreversibility of the intervention often forces this treatment option to be placed last in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations can occur with 5-year survival rates of implants between 65-90%.
This cause can never be removed by a perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limb transplants, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our experience from the last three years with the method we have developed of homologous central limboplastics.
Pentosane polysulphate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly decreases nocturnal frequency, while the diurnal frequency remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also decreased nocturia frequency in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosane polysulphate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, including radiological applications.
Thousands of websites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, competing with commercial offerings.
Following initial experiences, the task today is to critically evaluate the opportunities and risks of using the Internet as a medium for the dissemination of radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
We follow from a psychiatric and forensic point of view two cases in which the mothers after SID responded with unusually serious depression, blaming themselves for the murder of their child.
In conclusion, some recommendations for the care of parents are given.
The review of the cases of 110 children admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, for Burkitt lymphoma over a period of 7 years, showed an excess of male versus female patients (1.9
1) and a maximum age of 5 years.
The first areas affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen, and lungs were less affected.
It is thought that a correlation between infections by malaria and Epstein-Barr virus and malnutrition might play a role in the etiology of the tumour.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this medicine with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing disease recurrence but is superior to the single active substance in preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up of the patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia, the Zwickau clinic has been a well-known surgical centre.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Brown's life's work.
Zwickau's surgery provided important impetus for general and local anaesthesia, hospital construction and clinic organization, and surgical teaching in word and image.
Following a brief review of the literature, the aim is to present the aspects of psychodynamics and treatment of trichotillomania that have previously been little described in an adolescent patient.
Given the background of previous fears of abandonment, the threat of being dropped occurs anew as part of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which has hitherto served to regulate diffuse inner tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematous squamous skin disease with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%.
The often difficult to treat skin lesions occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance that can however cause pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We are reporting the occurrence of pustular dermatitis following the incorrect administration of a 50-fold higher concentration of dietranol in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
The treatment of renovascular hypertension is of particular importance since, as a secondary form of hypertension, it can be treated successfully in many cases and in some cases cured by interventional radiological or surgical measures.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications following LASIK should be investigated.
There is a report of one andrologic patient in whom the first examination revealed high grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The elevated FSH levels and significantly below normal testicular size indicated marked testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculatory smear may be considered as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic-assisted therapy with doxycycline, followed by a 3-month recovery period with a combination of vitamin C and E and the trace element zinc, there was considerable improvement in sperm counts.
At another 2 months, a pregnancy was achieved by intrauterine insemination followed by the birth of a healthy daughter.
At that time, the patient had only mild teratozoospermia.
In a quality control study, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different established standard anaesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the context of central serous chorioretinopathy in the context of systemic corticosteroid therapy should be described.
Today, the x-ray of the pelvic floor is still used in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy.
The legs of the infant should be held in a central position.
Side turns and increased inclination of the basin shall be avoided.
Back to 150 years, including 50 years of personal experience of the development of septorhinoplasty, the latest development of which took place in the 19th century in the "open approach" with the folding of the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be used again in the era of minimally invasive surgery.
A sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatic surgery is recommended.
In the diagnostic imaging of thoracic pathologies in mature and, in particular, immature neonates, the thoracic x-ray is the primary means.
A thorough knowledge of the normal thorax image and possible physiological peripheral changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of neonatal thoracic imaging.
Paediatric disorders:
A multitude of congenital and acquired changes encountered by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in adult radiodiagnosis.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or may affect the quality of life in later life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the paediatrician is therefore essential.
This is an overview of the main pathologies that the radiologist may face in his daily work.
The primary tumours included mammalian carcinoma (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric carcinoma (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinoma (n = 6 each) and 14 other tumours.
Extrahepatic tumour (including synchronous primary tumours) was present in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, and 51% (n = 61) of the 120 initial resections were extrahepatic tumour.
Of the 120 primary resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
Median survival was 20 months after first resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/ 2 resections.
After second resection (n = 14), median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumour at the time of the first liver resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/ 2 resection.
The present results show that resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases shows a certain prognostic advantage.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrence may even benefit from secondary or tertiary liver resection.
In some cases, impressive long-term trends could be observed even with a more unfavourable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself was perplexed by the strange act, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffered a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large A. communicans anterior aneurysm.
For the assessment of culpability, this history, in the context of the behavioural defects attested shortly before the offense, thus allows the possibility of a mental disorder at the time of the offence to be taken into account.
This may have been an epileptic twilight condition as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself in the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated in the vitreous body.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is floated and can be replaced in the anterior segment of the eye where it can be re-fixed, e. g. in the ciliary sulcus.
The nature of the PFCL contact with the IOL is unclear.
Since PFCL is likely to be biotoxic if kept for a prolonged period in the eye, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
A rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of a chondrosarcoma has been reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year symptom-free postoperative interval.
During subsequent investigations no clinically apparent metastases were found.
In view of the cases described so far, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic origin of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas anulare) of the two systems.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas anulare can ultimately only be secured by a gait representation of the pancreas.
The congenital diseases are genetic defects involving other organ systems and for which extrapancreatic damage is usually at the forefront of the disease picture.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases result in a variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected by modern imaging methods.
Books often contain more than just the author's own material.
From the work of Bärensprung and Hebra, it is shown that, at a second glance, they reveal several other facts relevant to medical history.
Approximately 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-present congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel chord and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The efficacy of ultrasound in bacterial coxitis has been evaluated.
A total of 259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n=14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n=12), Perthes disease (n=92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n=21) were studied by ultrasound.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the hip scapulae and the periarticular structures can be evaluated at the standard cut levels of the DEGUM.
Intraarticular space requirements (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected as joint capsule distention by sonography.
This capsule removal has been demonstrated by ultrasound in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and early stages of Perth disease.
Since joint capsule distention is not significantly different among individual diseases, the sonogram does not allow differentiation between these diseases in the presence of capsule distention without bone changes.
Bacterial coxitis cannot therefore be distinguished sonographically from coxids of other genera;
the capsule dilation is considered to be a non-specific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, prompt diagnostic puncture, possibly under sonographic monitoring, is necessary.
Due to additional bone changes in addition to the capsule distention, the epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be distinguished sonographically from both bacterial coxitis and coxids of other origins.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made by a combination of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since both cases had unusually high levels of differentiation of tumour cells for gliomatosis cerebri, the diagnosis was complicated by atypical findings such as contrast media uptake in MRI and clinical signs of intracranial hypertension.
Clinical history, differential diagnosis and literature are briefly presented.
Different experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomised clinical trial are presented, explained and problems identified.
Key aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to arrive at causal statements in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements of clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical procedures, but that in this sense good clinical research depends above all on careful study planning.
The potential influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has been evaluated in different ways.
In particular, the anticoagulant Phenprocoumone, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost entirely disregarded in studies.
This retrospective study was conducted to investigate a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
From 1 April 1996 to 30 June 1998, 7 patients aged 61 to 85 years with symptomatic infrared aortic stenosis were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneous thrombo-endarterectomy of the A. iliaca externa with profundaplasty was performed in one case and angioplasty with stent implantation of the A. iliaca communis was performed in another case.
Technical and clinical success was achieved in all cases.
No occlusion or clinical restenosis occurred over a median observation period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a minimally invasive and safe procedure with good long-term outcomes.
Summary There is a report of a patient who underwent several years of infertility treatment and became pregnant although she did not want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has been classified in the past as being apathogenic to humans.
A case report is given of a 72-year-old patient who had a culture of Aspergillus flavus in the tracheal secretion following an aortic coronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit.
The serological tests carried out, indirect haemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
are "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibodies coated latex particles, were repeatedly negative.
A postmortem aspergillus test, using a more recent method known as enzyme immunoassay antigen detection, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiological findings.
Patient died before anti-fungal therapy, autopsy revealed disseminated mycosis of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay may facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
Due to the correct assessment of pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated in the event of a single tracheal culture of Aspergillus flavus.
Epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidence of appendicitis and appendicectomy in developed countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation, particularly in young women, and the high rate of perforations in young children and the elderly, suggest low diagnostic certainty.
The analysis of the epidemiological data does not allow any clear conclusion on the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
After refractive surgery on the cornea and after cataract surgery, eye errors (aberrations) may occur which cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal required visus is often not achieved despite optimum correction.
The detection of these errors under clinical conditions would be an important first step in documenting and correcting these aberrations by means of modern photorefractive techniques.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile tests had been carried out experimentally.
Ecke and Hofmann thus concluded that flexible fixations are able to achieve comparable stability to rigid methods and that ankylosis is preferable because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis for prophylaxis.
By means of a simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental test under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations were tested comparatively by means of DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire harnesses and PDS bandings.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilisation).
Neither the wire harness nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, these methods permitting symphysis mobility beyond the physiological limitations immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, instability was increased by the incision of the cercal and banding ligaments in the bone or fracture of the wire cercal ligaments in general, to complete failure.
In the DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, by contrast, the success of stabilization was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
With the primary overturning of the screws, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic load.
With the primary stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable throughout 55 500 load shifts with a load equal to half of the average body weight.
For clinical application, these results suggest that neither the bridge bracing with wire cervical spine nor the PDS banding provide adequate stabilization of the ruptured symphysis for early post-operative mobilization under partial load.
If the DC plate or the reconstruction plate can primarily achieve a safe stabilization of the ruptured symphysis by well anchoring the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured man with an "open-book injury" can be mobilised at a partial load corresponding to half of the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs) have been successfully implanted for many years.
Due to the light distribution into several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
Additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects due to capsular fibrosis may lead to early visual impairment.
In a 69-year-old female patient, a 5 cm, moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumor was initially misdiagnosed as a primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
It was only during a screening of anaemia 17 months later when a 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected by duodenopancreatectomy.
The re-assessment of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and classification of the thyroid tumour as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died six months later from apoplectic stroke.
The autopsy results confirmed the assessment of the tumour as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes oral and topical administration of drugs.
The only approved oral substance with proven efficacy is yohimbine, a centrally active alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with a focused target area are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine significantly more effective than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mode of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both the intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous route of administration are available for topical application.
As a substance used at present, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely supplanted other drugs.
Currently, several promising substances with different modes of action and different dosage forms are in development as therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.
A form of nonverbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient's state of consciousness, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow which is especially important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be reached sufficiently by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy have led to the development of a variety of different strategies, which are collectively known as immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are generally between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients achieve stabilisation for a limited period, in some cases for several years.
These are mostly results from uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are generally not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high rates of remission can only be achieved in select patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy patients over non-immune or chemotherapy patients.
Guaranteed is a survival advantage for patients with objective remissions.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival benefit, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of existing therapy protocols and their high cost must be taken into account.
Because of the lack of therapeutic alternatives, the expected improvement in the currently achievable remission rates, and the survival benefit for immunotherapists reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component of the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Use should normally be in the context of clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, 262 males (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years) and 239 females (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years) were calculated from the values of 12 clinical chemical parameters of the laboratory index and verified for correlations with biological age according to Ries.
In the calculation of the index, alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides are included.
Significant correlations between laboratory indicators and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters are also significantly correlated with premature ageing.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides, and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the distal sigmoid epiploic appendix, was detected as a random finding of a hysterectomy with adnexctomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous ovarian tumours and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive growths between the epiploic appendages and the left parietal peritoneum and cytologic atypia in the peritoneal washing fluid.
These findings are thought to be due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and locations of primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
In addition to optimized placement of the grafted teeth in the root canal, the procedure was initially hoped to bring advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique could not be proven.
15 endoscopic and 14 open surgery patients were examined preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
Lysholm and Tegner score systems, ligament stability (KT-1000), surgical duration and proprioception were obtained by using the angular reproduction test.
The energy dose of the spiral computed tomography as well as of the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the CT machine manufacturer for dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured computed tomography energy dose was 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin surface in beam direction) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm of scanning distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average measurement accuracy was 0.1 - 0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approximately 76% had no effect on the longitudinal accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average a factor of 10 higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridisation) into virological diagnosis.
The introduction of histological and, particularly, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium in patients with a clinical diagnosis of suspected dilated cardiomyopathy allows for a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the 1995 WHO classification (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response, which can be detected by histological and, in particular, immunohistological techniques.
It was only by means of the combination of histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques that a subgroup analysis was performed on the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared with patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to the bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/ postoperative), the bacterial endogenous (haematogenic) osteomyelitis and the more rare group of bacterial, primarily chronic sclerotic osteomyelitis, which, unlike the others, is manifested preferably in the clavicle, can be distinguished.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis we treated from 1978 to 1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case studies.
Despite its rarity, the primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered in the differential diagnosis as it is a domain of conservative drug therapy based on a biopsy diagnosis.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication following cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatments, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors is based on the four pillars of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The paper uses a literature analysis to examine the role of overall treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimisation of chemotherapy protocols in three important oncological disorders.
Tumor models and the resulting hypotheses as well as particularly well designed clinical trials, can allow for advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumour diseases.
Castleman' s disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease of the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative agent, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thus changing cellular mechanisms which ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
This paper presents the in vitro and in vivo results of our research on paclitaxel.
After comparison of 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was preferred for in vivo application.
Staining of the cytoskeleton and electron optics demonstrated the effect of paclitaxel in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
In rabbits, topically applied paclitaxel resulted in significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and vascular diameter enlargement compared to ballooned controls.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contractile strength was shown after administration of paclitaxel.
In addition to the age-related deposition of waste products between the cytoplasmic and the basal membranes of RPE cells (basal laminar deposits), various manifestations of early and late AMD such as glands, choriodal neovascularizations, and pigment epithelial ablation present a rupture of the membrane between the basal membrane of RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-related regression of the adhesion apparatus can be detected.
Recent research indicates that spinal cord dysplasia and spondylolysis are the result of impaired spinal growth.
The symptoms of rheumatic hand-flexor disease should be established depending on the location of the lesions and the type of visual disease in order to provide early surgical treatment with maintenance of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of the frequent dermatoses there are no suitable natural animal models.
The transgenic technology, which was established in the 1980s, fills this gap.
Initially it was a tool in the hands of purely basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also made its way into the clinically oriented specific basic dermatological research.
It was possible to mimic HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatosis in the mouse model and gain insight into their pathogenesis.
By targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, such mice can be used to study the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumours.
The availability of animal models of human dermatoses also allows the targeted research into experimental therapies such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in wearers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues, such as processes in the posterior cranial socket, spinal abscesses, and complaints within the knee, can be better investigated by MRI than by other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect wearers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in wearers of artificial heart valves appears to be insufficient.
Therefore, in 1998 a survey was carried out among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindications of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on unseen data, or blamed the doctor performing the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
A survey of our participants provides an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and requirements for MRI safety standards for wearers of artificial heart valves.
In an experimental study, 10 pigs with an average body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg were given intravenous CO2 or argon embolization with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml of bolus, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after 30 ml of bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5) none of the animals died or required resuscitation.
Low-soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old female patient with disseminated granuloma annulare in a known diabetic metabolic condition.
In addition, there was a kidney failure that prevented us from receiving oral photochemotherapy.
We have performed a balneophotochemotherapy with 8-Methoxypsoral-Total-body Bath using a foil method, which, after 30 treatments, has resulted in complete recovery of the lesions on the trunk and neck, and marked improvement in the skin finding on the extremities.
There were no side effects.
Through balneophotochemotherapy, not only epidermal processes but also dermal processes can be affected therapeutically.
Cat scratch disease (CCD) is an infectious disease little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was isolated.
The majority of cases have a typical disease profile, with skin lesions in the area of cat bite or scratch lesions and benign lymphadenopathy.
Other organ manifestations are less common.
We are reporting on a 47-year-old female patient who developed reactive spondyloarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbar ulcers following a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far only a few cases of joint participation in a KKK have been described.
However, because the infection rate of Bartonella henselae in cats is high in Europe, it may be a more common cause of joint complaints than previously thought.
The diagnosis of CKD has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarise the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Through continuous optimisation over the past few years, the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved dramatically.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a number of possible long-term complications which the treating physician needs to be aware of.
Due to the often prolonged symptoms of fatigue, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the quality of life of most young patients is impaired.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia following primary successful therapy is a significant problem.
Based on attachment styles as defined patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990) was to operationalize these patterns appropriately, in the sense of their original definition, i.e. as specific configurations of characteristics.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "confident", "avoidant", and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on the results of factor analysis, three scales were established:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters which can be interpreted as attachment styles:
'certain', two variants of 'uncertain-ambivalent' ('closed' and 'clinging') and two variants of 'uncertain-avoidant' ('closed' and 'cooperative').
The discrimination analysis of these clusters has produced discrimination functions which are similar to those of Collins and Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al. (1990).
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive inner-ear hearing loss, dizziness, and the simultaneous radiological evidence of an absorptive spatial demand of the inner auditory canal, strengthened the suspicion of the presence of acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a history of known Sharp Syndrome and the initial typical constellation of findings.
The present case study shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the angle of the cerebellum, which manifested itself by a peripheral brain-nerve failure in the CNS area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the absence of all peripheral brain nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial paresis occurring within a few weeks, and the typical occipital cephalgia with radiation into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings such as that described above, despite the presence of leading symptoms, must be challenging to obtain differential diagnostic clarification.
The occurrence of solitary lymphomas at the angle of the cerebellum is considered a rarity.
Further therapeutic options available to the gynecologist in the office, clinic and in rehabilitation, include balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or complementary treatment measures.
In gynaecology, balneogynekology as a natural treatment method has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures should be used as complementary measures in relation to the indication.
Only in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they suitable for pain relief and tissue benefit as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnosis currently takes an average of four weeks to produce a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent susceptibility testing.
Seven to eight weeks must elapse before a negative culture result is reported.
Faster results in individual diagnostic steps are possible by means of new techniques, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The alarming epidemiological situation worldwide as regards the risk of TB infections leaves no doubt about the need for further development of methods which will allow detecting, differentiating and testing mycobacterial bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity for susceptibility to antibiotics in the shortest possible time.
In a prospective randomised study, non-articular mounting of the small external fixator of the AO for the treatment of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 AO classification) is compared to the delivery of percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with casts.
The collection of donated milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of their favorable composition, the milk of donor mothers who themselves have premature babies is preferred for very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years a large number of day centres (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centres (KBSn) have emerged as complementary day care facilities in Germany.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the general lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and their methods of operation.
In the present study 100 visitors to TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Features of the social situation, psychopathological symptoms and views of the visitors were surveyed.
Almost all of the visitors had previously been admitted to a psychiatric ward.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably in medium to moderate severity.
Two thirds of the visitors were single, most living alone and with few or no friends.
The positive aspects of the facilities were the contact with other people and the structuring of the day.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
The TSn visitors were on average younger and had higher scores on the BPRS subscale energy.
As for the rest, the visitors to the two institutions differed little in the characteristics studied.
The results suggest that both institutions in fact care for the chronically mentally ill with poor social integration for whom they are designed to care.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Limits and consequences of the results are discussed.
Functional studies of the brain for a long time were possible only with nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of rapid imaging sequences, optimised contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods have made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1 and T2* weighted contrast-assisted imaging sequences may capture information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and blood-brain barrier permeability using specific, e.g. nuclear medicine based models.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in tissue can be represented by diffusion-weighted MRI, macrovasculature, time resolution, MRI angiography techniques.
MRI spectroscopy can be used to detect multidimensional metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissues and to observe metabolic processes as they occur.
The advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional presentation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The clinical functional methods are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value in comparison with nuclear medicine methods.
In tumour diagnostics, functional MRI techniques provide important additional information for therapy design, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are capable of sensitively detecting pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared aim of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to establish health care at the highest possible level of awareness in the countries of the European region, also in the light of constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors harmful to health are to be combated or prevented at international level, by means of specific actions.
A key requirement is agreement on international environmental and health standards, as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem solving strategies.
The need to ensure that governments and the public develop a common understanding of the major environmental health issues.
To ensure the most seamless flow of information and communication between environmental and health professionals, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health" at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997 with financial support from the German Federal Ministry of Health.
There is a report of a 30- year-old patient with right lateral amaurosis fugax with concomitant fronto-basal fracture following a fall.
CT and MR angiography indicated an enclosure of A. ophthalmica following dissection of A. carotis interna with ascending thrombosis as the cause.
No other neurological deficits were identified, as adequate blood supply to the cerebral arteries via the Circulus arteriosus cerebri was guaranteed.
In the aetiological variety of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be given appropriate aetiological, diagnostic and therapeutic consideration.
Suspicion of acute aortic dissection requires immediate evaluation with appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, or aortography.
In this case, an aortic dissection was suspected on echocardiography in an asymptomatic patient.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other imaging procedures to diagnose evidence of an aneurysmically enlarged thoracic aortic castration and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was hospitalized with acute chest pain, increasing dyspnoea and an image of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In further clarification by echocardiography, a ruptured sinus valve aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a left-right shunt into the right atrium was detected as a non-invasive cause.
The heart surgery went smoothly with the aortic valve intact.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right ventricle sections were normal width, and the color Doppler detected no shunt.
Acute heart failure can also occur in middle age as a result of congenital heart defects.
Non-invasive, precise diagnosis was achieved by the use of echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography.
Rodent syndrome is characterized by mandibular-facial and extremity malformations.
Hypoplasia of the lower jaw may cause airway obstruction by affecting the tongue at the back of the throat, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who, due to persistent dyspnoea, received nasal CPAP and sedation for five months.
After extension treatment of the soft tissues, mandibular distractive osteogenesis was performed for a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic results are good.
Respiratory obstruction and dyspnoea were not observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thoraco-arterioctomies (TEA) of A. carotis interna result in improved perfusion in the area of the stream of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about the cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors on the diagnostic and therapeutic approach in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (first ISDN links, later the use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in day-to-day clinical practice is largely defined, but the adequate remuneration for this independent medical service is still unclear.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
There is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
The following is a 38-year-old patient who has suffered for years from a progressive effluvium in psoriasis outbreaks in the capillaries.
Histologically imposed striatal fibrosis in place of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytes infiltrate into the upper dermis, incidentally attack the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and markers of scalp psoriasis.
Clinical history and lack of evidence of another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
The knowledge of this possible relationship is important in that consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent the effluvium and thus likely the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormone (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves several clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The decreased GH secretion is thought to be due to an increased somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent periods of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenal tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with the consequent reduction in GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behaviour (SVB).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of classic neuroleptics is questionable.
Risperidone, a serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist, was also effective in reducing SVV in the long term in open-label and controlled trials.
The aim of this study was to create an osteoporotic model by overectomy.
Osteodensitometry measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA before and after ovariectomy.
A significant reduction in bone density after ovarectomy was observed in both the upper and lower jaws.
Patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic haemarthrosis of the knee joint were evaluated and treated by arthroscopy.
The causes of the transfusions were varied:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from eroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
The surgical treatment, usually arthroscopic, had good results.
In Germany, venomous snakebite injuries in children are almost exclusively caused by vipers (Vipera berus).
The roundworm injects a toxin made up of various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Poison ivy bites in children can be asymptomatic, but can also cause severe symptoms of poisoning.
Furthermore, pathological findings in their environment can be represented on a large scale.
The transmission of the ultrasound result to the therapists not present at the examination and the control of a result, e.g. a tumour, during therapy, will thus be significantly improved.
Viruses have also become more mobile as a result of increased human mobility and activity around the world.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies means that more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in less and less time.
This study examines, on the basis of four case examples, the factors which may influence the early or late diagnosis of dementia.
We have indicated surgery in all our cases.
The perforation site was primarily sutured and thoroughly rinsed and drained.
In two cases the suture was additionally secured with fiber adhesive or with a plastic plaster.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Based on our own findings and on the analysis of the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified:
If early perforation is secured, definitive surgical intervention is indicated.
In case of delayed diagnosis of advanced mediastinitis, closure of the perforation site should also be attempted.
An additional protection is recommended in these cases.
Resection procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases, due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are being compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidneys, Wilms tumours are 2 to 8 times more common.
Wilms tumours are malignant mixed-tissue tumours that rarely have a large proportion of adipose tissue.
We are reporting on a 28-month-old girl with an uncommon Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney which, due to its large proportion of lipomatosis with internal calcification, could have been a teratoma by radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different section methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations were correlated in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumour.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare condition that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
We have a report of a 58-year-old patient with a six-month history of bloody, purulent expectoration and significant weight loss who was referred to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
Only by a diagnostic detour could the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis be made.
The trigger was an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
With antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of the disease rapidly decreased and the patient was eventually cured.
Bronchoscopy is also an important component in the differential diagnostics of thoracic space requirements, which include inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatic tumors, and germ cell tumors.
Arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare defect in the hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasis (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease).
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective treatment.
The case of a 53-year-old patient is described, in whom percutaneous embolization failed due to adverse vascular anatomy.
Instead, adjustable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After mini-laparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and adaptive throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The described technique is therefore an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies in the self examination material in 20 years.
Although the proportion of puerperal mastitis in relation to the number of births is estimated at around 1%, the various forms of non-puerperal mastitis have come to the forefront both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of mastitis cases currently diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small proportion are the expression of an irritant-related infectious or specific disease, such as sarcoidosis or paniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumour-like fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), in endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases where there is no evidence of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and suspected of irritation-related mastitis, bacteriological and microbiological examination of the fresh material should always be carried out.
Infectious colitis with the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile preferably occurs in patients with weakened immune systems or treated with antibiotics.
We report on boys aged 25 and 14, respectively, with Clostridium difficile colitis without the above-mentioned pre-existing conditions or underlying medical condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the application of the relevant protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily respiratory screening and spontaneous breathing tests are valuable aids that should be included in a withdrawal protocol.
Once the condition and ability of spontaneous respiration are documented, extubation in ventilated patients should be encouraged, as there is sufficient evidence that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated following an attempt at spontaneous breathing.
Escheat withdrawal of mechanical ventilation may be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous respiration has been unsuccessful.
Two randomised trials show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the rate and extent of withdrawal success and that SIMV is the least successful withdrawal technique.
Secondary septorrhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare baseline and surgical outcomes in 30 patients with single-sided LKG columns.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The softness analysis of the nose was performed by measuring standardised nasal scans and lateral radiograph.
Deviations from the ideal shape of the nasal symmetry, nasal width and the nose wing approach line were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the naso-phasic, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and Frankfurter Horizontalen, and the angle between the columella and Frankfurter Horizontalen.
For the evaluation of air permeability, anterior rhinomanometry was used.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined and the flow of the cleavage and non-cleavage side was compared.
The studies were carried out immediately before and 6 months after surgery.
In the frontal plane, there is a significant correction of nasal symmetry and alignment of the nasal wing.
Significant improvement in peak nasopharyngeal angle and the deep nasal wing was not achieved.
The intervention increased the total flow and achieved a correction of the flow quotient of the split and the non-slit sides.
The study methods used make it possible to objectivise the aesthetically and functionally relevant results and thus serve as quality control.
Studies and incident reports of manual therapy of the spine from the years 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no properly conducted prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with spinal manipulation found in the literature.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in assessing hip joint disease.
Conventional MRI can reliably show normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, however, the joint fluid necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments is often absent.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases since intra-articular CM application distends the joint space with improved distinctness of intra-articular structures.
This joint dilation with MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage assessment of osteochondritis dissecans as in cases of unstable lesions a KM flushing of the dissect can be demonstrated more readily.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free joint bodies which often require surgical treatment.
MRI, although invasive, provides important additional information in the investigation of the post-traumatic joint, as well as various joint disorders.
The therapeutic aim of resuscitation must be the social reintegration of the person after acute treatment, ideally in the state before the emergency.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a rural area.
Varicocele is the most important acute complication of a mainstream varicosis of the V. saphena magna and/ or parva type.
Ascension can cause migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the mouths of the trunk veins in the groin and the kneecap or via insufficient V. perforans, threatening the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicocele of the main veins without involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and / or parva and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient V. perforans into the deep veins.
In these cases, surgery should be performed after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The surgery includes crocectomy, extirpation of the stem veins through separate incisions, exhairesis of all varicose branches, and ligation of insufficient V. perforantes.
For type III, thrombectomy via the V.saphena magna and/ or parva duct has precedence over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, asymptomatic thickening of the lateral portions of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
The formal pathogenesis of the disease is caused by a benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of coercion seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic-uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms include irritability, restlessness, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological failure.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute neurologic psychosis with progressive loss of consciousness to coma.
Initial cranial CT showed a discrete, generalized brain swelling that regressed independent of clinical deterioration.
The cranial MRI was inconspicuous.
Generalised increases in flow velocity were found in transcranial Doppler sonography (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides and A. basilaris).
The causal relationship between river speed increases and altered consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of river speed increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV, and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
Continuous follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injury confirms the correctness of the patient adapted approach.
Although the gold standard for care of cruciate ligament injuries is replacement plastic, autologous reinforcement reintegration for adolescents is an excellent option.
We're reporting a rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
It was preceded by blunt chest trauma in a car accident.
A computed tomography (CT) scan could not diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with cranial rib fractures following blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be required, if possible, to rule out life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and differ significantly from them.
This brief presentation of American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a solid basis for his own practical work concerning many everyday, but by no means minor, problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma was treated with prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/ kg KGxmin over a 6-day incubation period.
Treatment resulted in improvements in inflammatory parameters, lung function, in particular diffusion capacity, and marked acral blood disorder.
The elbow joint is considered as the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view due to its central location.
Knee and ligament injuries in the proximal forearm area confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, together with chronic pain symptoms and restricted mobility, necessarily reduce the function of the entire arm.
There is little doubt today that in the majority of cases, a primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with precise reconstruction of the joint surface is as indispensable for a satisfactory outcome as is an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical particularities of the proximal forearm, a decisive change has taken place in the last decades in therapeutic principles, the current state of which is presented in this work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can be fatal.
Manipulation by the patient of portions of electrodes through the skin may result in damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode insertion and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This medicine is a further development of mycophenol acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
This review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of Mycophenolate mofetil and summarises the current experience with this product in dermatology.
With automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology now offers the possibility of precise tomographic analysis of structures in individual steps.
The electronic memory can be used to easily reconstruct image levels which cannot be represented by conventional techniques.
The surface and transparency modes also allow a visual representation of stored structures.
With these different imaging possibilities and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D ultrasound is setting new standards in the diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In one 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After transient paresthesias, the accidental infusion caused burning pain in the legs with motor and sensory innervation failure up to segment TH 11 accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as those described are usually due to errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
These measures include colour marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions and the use of syringe pumps with a larger medicine reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
Consideration of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology.
A first approach, to establish a baseline evaluation of the influence of jaw comb height and width, was the analysis of 95 toothless bony jaws from collections that had been standardised sawed, measured and classified.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implants were simulated at 269 cross sections and then differentiated by implant type, cross section position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was performed in 24 consecutive implant patients with toothless maxilla in the clinical phase.
Implantation at the jaw was possible in only 35% of the incisions, but could be expected with a sufficient jaw height in another 4.5%.
Implant length reductions were necessary in an additional 6%.
Dependencies were mainly on the atrophy class.
Anterior cross sections offered much more favourable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not demonstrated in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient altitude was noted in 22 cases, and a transverse too narrow alveolar ridge was detected at sufficient altitude in 2 cases only during surgery.
The results allow the quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimensions.
This importance is primarily in relation to the bone height, although even at a sufficient height, reductions in implant length are often necessary.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain on both the cadaver jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and on the patient (8%) for which the height measurement alone falsifies false proportions and a precisely planned surgery may have to be abolished.
The complexity and cost of implant rehabilitation and the impact of improper preoperative planning justify or even require, in principle, enhanced diagnostic imaging measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to investigate metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
As tumours show increased glycolysis, these can be detected using radio-labelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proved successful with different tumour entities.
In this study, PET was used in the lymph node staging of bladder cancer.
Preoperative PET imaging was performed in 64 patients on the pelvis following IV injection of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) to compare the PET reading with the histological reading of the surgical preparation by classical surgical lymph node staging.
During lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly identified in 14 patients;
This data gives a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and a hit rate of 80%.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than conventional imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect immune deficiency in 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis.
Only 9 patients had subnormal immunoglobulin serum levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It affects the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/ or immunoglobulin therapy is necessary.
If chronic sinus infections persist despite conservative treatment, mucosal-protective sinus surgery is indicated, but it alone cannot give the desired result in this disease.
An immune subclass deficiency should be considered as an indicator of an impaired immune system.
Transitions to severe immunodeficiency with development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old female patient with extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the torso and on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis which usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin led to a marked decrease in lesions.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - particularly the adult bladder cyst, first described in 1990 - are discussed.
Maintenance of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resections has increased since the widespread use of nerve-sparing preparations and complete excision of the mesorectum.
However, in the literature, there are post-operative rates of ED and urinary incontinence between 25% and 67%.
Materials and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were visualized on 10 cadavers and two formaldehyde-containing, isolated pelvic preparations.
Their relationship and possible sites of damage were imaged and photographed during the surgical mobilisation of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically defined structures with little interindividual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense fibre network around the stem of the A. mesenterica inferior (AMI) with a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral wall of the rectum and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonville fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2 - S5 shall not be isolated via standard surgical access.
The nomenclature of fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the pelvis are not clearly defined in the literature.
High levels of AMI cessation will inevitably lead to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3 The close relationship between the rectum and the autonomic nerve fibres makes a sharp preparation in direct vision essential.
Fasciæ and nerves may be used as guide structures in the preparation.
The selective preservation of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via standard surgical approach.
Early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is important for prognosis and pioneering in the treatment planning.
In a prospective study conducted from 1993 to 1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx and lip were panendoscopically staged to evaluate the ability to make the early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract using this approach.
Panendoscopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the nasal, oro- and hypopharynx.
The final examination was the micro-laryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspected areas.
The proportion of concurrent secondary carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precancers could also be diagnosed by panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Cancer Centre of Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary carcinomas in a primary patient in the head and neck area.
Given the good experience so far and the absence of complications, it is obvious that this study does not pose any additional risk to the patients, therefore panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging of head and neck cancers.
Diagnosis of Huntington' s disease can present significant problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, particularly in the early stages of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's chorea, who for over seven years has had the psychopathological changes as her primary symptom, and been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic.
Unusually, and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis, was the very early onset of the disease and the significant delay in onset in comparison with other affected family members.
However, the phenomenon of the early onset of disease is well documented in the literature for the case of transmission of the mutated gene from the father.
A major breakthrough in differential diagnosis was the observation of the subtle abnormalities in the patient's movement pattern, and the following detailed analysis of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focuses:
As climate therapy, as (balneo) phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain groups of patients benefit differently, indications for psychosomatic treatment are being developed:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological condition and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated in dermatoses of psychogenesis or with psychic involvement, if depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapeutic motivation are present.
In case of problems in the processing of disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant skin neoplasms, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
The following is intended to illustrate the importance of orthopaedic devices such as bandages and orthoses for disorders in the lateral ligament of the hip.
Thereafter the mechanisms of action of orthoses as described in the literature with respect to joint stabilisation, injury prevention and influence on athletic performance and proprioceptive skills are discussed.
The present work deals with long-term changes in Müller-type cemented polyethylene pans.
Cold flow and abrasion alter the shape of the polyethylene to varying degrees.
The amount of abrasion is measured by the displacement of the hip head in the pan.
Within the first few years postoperatively there is a relatively large annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
It is inclined to 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head) after about five years.
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavourable for prosthesis loosening.
In this study, for a total of 369 hip replacements, the center of the hip head in relation to the pan marking wire was determined and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average life of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
In the metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this value was achieved only in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The elastic polyethylene-ceramic pairing reduces the abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene-metal pairing.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated in patients who are not able to consent, the consent of the caregiver is required to perform the convalescence treatment.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had decided that there was a justified risk of long-term damage to health and had accepted the requirement for consent.
However, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapy in the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis, subject to contraindications.
The use of unilateral ECS reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive adverse events.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs very rarely and is negligible in view of the risks of the underlying disease.
An interim court authorization requirement under the Care Act is, in the opinion of the authors, to be rejected.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is induced, in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance, by volatile anaesthetics and succinylcholine, among other agents.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH Group is the "gold standard" in the diagnosis of phenotypic HD, due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%), and the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high association between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and HD disposition.
Once the C1840T (Arg614Cys) mutation on the RYR1 gene had been detected in an individual from a large family, the presence of this mutation in other family members and the correspondence with the IVKT was of interest.
The ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system disorders of the child are relatively uniform in sonography:
These changes usually include: swelling of the lymph node and organ, as well as a disruption of normal echo texture, usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
In the parenchymal organs, 4 main infiltration patterns are observed by sonography:
diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and the bulky type.
Success is shown on ultrasound by the normalization of lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ homogeneity, and the recovery of tumor- or inflammatory complications.
Differential diagnostic information is derived from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions and, with some reservations, from the echogenicity and dopplersonographically analysable estimates of blood circulation.
The primary diagnosis should always be confirmed histologically.
Background and question.
Transitional acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, typically presents clinically itchy, edema-like, or hyperkeratotic papules or papular vesicles predominantly on the trunk, that spontaneously heal after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
With a still unclear etiology, light, sweat and heat are discussed as provoking factors.
