The July issue is traditionally rented out during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: subtracting the stripes when the soul breaks for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell you about the Moscow International Film Festival next time (so far I will only complain that this year an inexplicable idea has finally strengthened in the minds of the organizers that the happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report for what we saw in Cannes and on Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man who, by the way, rebooted "Batman"...), the most - without fools - the expected film of the summer.
And this time we are also publishing the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is certainly not necessary to specifically advertise anything, and it is clear to the hedgehog that the author of "Suspicions" and "Ropes" - this is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurei, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina Londinku-Tsereushnitsa Evelyn Salt, despite the brilliant track record, they were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch it at all costs.
Cornered, she will repaint in her usual black and go looking for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie as a fatal boy-woman promises to further consolidate the actress's position in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and how to scatter strong men in the same strict suits.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a boring American-type block buster about the salvation of mankind, but the cutest living carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between Element... and Adele... I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this script and production fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." -Hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe opposite and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case it is sinful more than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises await you at every turn or cue.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hint that "Adele's Extraordinary Adventures" will begin as "Amelie," rush towards < Jurassic Park," continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy," and end with "Titanic."
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin appeared in only three films before Adele.
The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco," for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate special effects, scenery or tricks, but carries along with him, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a big journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows everything decisively, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying yourself cynicism and not being embarrassed by risk
DIRECTOR Luke Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgozne, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
PLOT: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster, which was awakened by an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much for the beast itself as for the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMING OUT JULY 22
"Adele..." - the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (he was bowed and ridiculed here), and finally with the same "Fifth Element."
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal stunts, acting clowning and plot balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is more organic and strong than ever).
A few words must be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.
In the cinema, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of duty macho or hair romance
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face the story
There is only a timid and comical sounder who only turns underfoot (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the society of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour Luke Besson showed unexpected creative dashing, recalling that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and high-minded regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing adventure cinema without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
The hermetic horror with a claim to psychologism and political context in 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was scolded by critics, but the audience liked it and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got to the factory, nodding new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to reshoot all the horror classics in the form of remakes and entrusted Libesman with the prequel "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Criticism grimaced again, but the public liked it again - Libesman worked in the spirit of "new scary," emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, you can observe how a whole genre rushes in convulsions, trying to invent new ways to influence the jaded public: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot resembles the Saw franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is the debut picture of Vincenzo Natalie "Cube." The film is already made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Libesman was forced to take a different path: stupid massacre or monotonous running away from the maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious blood, but with psychological play and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with test subjects.
And the three men in the locked room are trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or trying to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they pass the test, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, whom an experienced professor who is skilled in wild experiments tests for ruthlessness.
PLOT: For $250, four volunteers sign up for an uncomplicated test
They are put in an isolated room and given each pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A survival game begins, with government agents watching the glass closely.
Too thoughtful for a horror, but not enough for a frank arthouse
He can conduct a small talk, and go around the face with a fire extinguisher, but cannot miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is prudent and adamant in her sympathies.
In her father's courtly lifestyle, she is stung and openly spies on how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgels, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter is rebellious, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the difference between generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake."
Dad's growing daughter in the comedy genre convincingly portrayed Depardieu
The fractional plot winds around the love affairs of the heroes, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, according to a witty directorial find, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, a drunken athlete performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are only dotted.
Especially sorry for the line about the business of buying up football players, and remaining behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything, the football star selling agent is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate dad himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a rod."
What is the businessman's disappointment when Nastya chooses his peer and business partner in the struggle for independence and in defiance of his father.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got into the top nine: "Do not look for a problem where it does not exist." You can't say more precisely.
Their similarity simply cannot but amaze.
In both tapes there are detachments of stern guys, soldiers of good luck, forced to take revenge on those who set them up and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
Heroes jump through almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and there and there something explodes, stuffed with dollar bills, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the scenery.
Even villains dressed up in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (Patrick plays them in both cases - Jason Patrick is here, Patrick Wilson is there).
Zoe Saldan's previous role is Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot about dance battles - "Brotherhood of Dance."
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that was released in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - an 80s comedy series.
It's just amazing how they, without saying a word, led different material to an absolutely identical thundering denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films that evoke a lot of paintings with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you choose between these two tapes, then the "Losers" look a little prettier and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least here is Zoe Saldana, who is very bazooka
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA was framed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were presumed dead from that second.
But they are alive - and intend by all means to take revenge on the villain with a languid voice who set it all up.
All this is cute, but to be honest, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting is only worth it if you have no more interesting options at all.
Made from recyclables, conditionally edible militant
A simple story about a fugitive Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film screening.
In principle, having only this data on hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, moreover, tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
Also in the picture there will be many, many Romanian poverty (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who in the early 80s gave a lecture about Bresson
The film received the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on the play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave."
Cameraman Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All that has been said is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - get us right - is not at all abusive, but advisory in nature: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development, when the faith of its representatives in methods
its work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith can you withstand the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the talented Pisterean (whose story, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily
convert to exploitation a la 70s, with a cowboy who decided to walk from the prison, from where he will soon leave, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: Having chopped off his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
The affair with the social worker Anna further encourages the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What nonsense all this is!
If you want to watch, watch.
Not a bad debut, inspiring little hope that a decent direction will ever grow from the Romanian arthouse
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin (Sop) and his co-author Renault was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
"Despicable me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at the AO), especially if you like it when different objects now and then strive to jump out of the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single below-the-belt joke, because of which at the "Ice Ages" I had to bashfully squeeze into a chair and close the children's ears with hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia anyway.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of lonely fatherhood, quite tough black humor is responsible (which, I would like to think, we owe to the director Coffin).
In general, this is a very cute movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
One feels the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who have thought over every little thing so that all categories of citizens like the film.
Not that we wanted to see how the heroes of the children's cartoon would be eaten by cannibals or killed by an atomic explosion
PLOT: Nosy villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have transformed over the years into the idea of ​ ​ stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to fulfill a great plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In a certain advanced shelter, he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, comparable in lethal degree to only a cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, nosy and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Siegel.
In the final, Gru dances the part of Travolta
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of solid boobs come out.
Exactly.
The carriers of this gift themselves are not so essential.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately inform the good news - the whole film is sustained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of fun going on.
"Broker," "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, pour water (do not ask why), carry some kind of blizzard and periodically fight completely fiercely.
The creators believe that a swearing heifer with generous shapes, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and teeth shining with whiteness is cool.
"Bitchy things" are primarily focused on classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of Xena - Warrior Queens and The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules.
A similar-minded film at the Moscow box office is "Trunk for Jennifer."
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty spins eggs to a bandit, fucking punk fights in tandem with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are attached to this; and the intrigue is spun through endless flash-backs.
In general, for a fetishist movie, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this thrash parody, had fun from the heart, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If not for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia ringleader to the desert who has a substantial amount of diamonds hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to snatch, fight with each other and scumbags periodically arriving from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they introduced at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier.
Product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest picture, "Doomsday," a sprawling "Mad Max" for the have-nots, Marshall misfired badly
Bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shattered trust.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy about a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and fierce film aesthetics of category "B."
There is in the picture and hooligan courage "dogs-warriors," and the bestial cruelty of "descent."
The Marshall Plan to cleanse the peplum of adhering post-gladiatorial film dirt has generally worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are harsh men trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
The murder and piquant details of the departure of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now reference "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason I absolutely do not want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, Daveed Morrissey
PLOT: Lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, is ruthlessly defeated by a reconnaissance of the Picts.
Miraculously escaped, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other surviving Romans, try to sneak out of a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itain (Kurylenko).
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win back only ostentatious supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after Centurion the situation will change.
Peplum - - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator," only more modest and harsh
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her difficult relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's groupies held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald sorcerer boy, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The lord of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and tirelessly works in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the sleep of the object, it makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in the hope of defeating the evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will arrange bedlam in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
Bald as a billiard ball, the pussy has planned to take over the whole world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
Second series of fluffy family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs, led by a flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens open a sports hunt for them.
Bringing the iconic 80s character back to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-now-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a highly curious existential study of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and delving into human nature.
"The visionary artist of Corbijn's scale and the magnificent George Clooney is a movie union made in heaven," the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking as a basis the novel by Martin Booth "A Very Secretive Gentleman," Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the narrator-Englishman was taken by the title American, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while killer Jack is trying to deal with his last business and finally tie up with a profitable craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonachelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ryuten), in whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be the one he pretends to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, peppered with Clooney's ash hair (the film is like a long 02 clip), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe to star in film adaptation of Remarque's' On the Western Front'
Can I click you from the photo gun!?
Johnny Depp this season could be seen in two places at the same time.
Firstly, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with the heroine Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the site of the "Rum Diary," the film adaptation of the debut novel of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Whitnale and Me), whose last directorial work was the thriller Jennifer 8 in 1992.
Looking at the work of the posters of the domestic prison drama, one can not even doubt what inspired them.
But one cannot approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although alien, is not at all bald.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
On their account there are already four joint projects: "Lucky Gilmore," "Big Dad," "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding," "Do not joke with Gohan!."
In July, the fifth comedy, Odnoklassniki, is released, and the sixth, The Pretender Wife, with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in work.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill," where Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the viewer this year by the enchanting action movie Kick-Ass, will reboot the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class," the director first called James McAvoy, assigning him the role of a young professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will be reincarnated as the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the filming of the new series of Bondiana is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to miss.
On the list of his affairs is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of the novel by Isan McYouzn "On the Shore."
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the female lead.
Gary Oldman considers the role of practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of the series of novels by John Le Caret - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Spy, Get Out!."
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not easy (the novel has six parallel storylines), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already gone to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKelen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, filming of the international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went for their money to a real war in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell to star in comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
According to the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay with Hitler."
Nevertheless, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monstro"), Angelina Jolie ("Life Interrupted"), Jessica Lang ("Blue Sky," "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connely ("Mind Games"), Geena Davis ("Random Tourist") and "The first vice-miss SShA-86" Halle Berry ("Ball of Monsters") began as fashion models or starred for fashion magazines, as a result they received a well-deserved Oscar.
Succeeded in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, which is especially nice, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
They clearly have high awards at arm's length.
In short, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who earned a special mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and shot the scandalous television series "School," received the position of creative director on the MT channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, it is already planned to shoot its own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanica also began casting new presenters.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Freaks."
The main theme of the film remains the same - the provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hurries to Moscow to see his bride, but lingers to coach the football team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadia will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, the third will appear - the former groom of Nadia Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a mass of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of director.
The studios persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters fully into his own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only in case of urgent need.
David Eates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose Jackson-produced film District 9 received an Oscar nomination, are named as possible successors.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie to play Cleopatra
Sensed by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers at super speeds rushed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Pearl Hotel, in which press conferences and round tables were flowing, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of competitive films also behaved like themselves - in almost everyone someone ran somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Guest Worker" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Another Sky" were looking for a missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's picture "Live"
The same cops were happily circled around the finger by the hero of detective Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" - who, however, was remembered by the public rather by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
Heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergei Shnurov played a trucker taking a circus animal to slaughter, and Yevgeny Grishkovets speculated on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction," where business partners called each other to alkoduel because of the lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr bore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian art house, Sergei Tolstikov, chairman of the foundation for supporting Russian cinema, arranged a picturesque match with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he asked the audience menacingly.
"I write them," the president of ERVEZ replied in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that the extra Russian show was a hindrance to them.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - films of large festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, say, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, in the spring competing with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Azure Beret.
Nikita Sergeevich at "Kinotavr" visited the film of a former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
On the contrary, the chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - received a daughter
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked into monstrous actions without any visible purpose.
A precisely choreographed, cathartic experience film made by a math-educated misanthrope who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the viewer's joy lies in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture of "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star was born.
Impeccably dressed and tonsured programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman falls on the house, an unfair hand of punitive organs falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants," producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly said from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics considered otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull out the "internal debutant" from the coryphaeus of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema bison are moving after young people.
And not the other way around.
A documentary made in such a way that it blows its head clean than from a similar feature film.
The author is also interested in a screwdriver that examines an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted cream drifting along a cast-iron pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real oil dock.
The winner of the short meter competition Nikolai Sokolov tries on the black and white style of the French new wave on the world of sleeping areas.
Let Godarov's editing moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other - to play Bach backwards, look strange, but thanks for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft such as An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological cartridges with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" the clouds going to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and exactly where the impact on the cloud occurred."
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the sci-fi film, in which Michael Iork played the main role.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his schedule), famous for his commercials.
Previously, the names of Brian Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeague (V for vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski ("Throne: Legacy") were associated with the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez acquired the rights to the rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to make it a large-scale movie.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (m/f "The Lord of the Rings," 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Fracetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, the warrior Larne saves Princess Tigger and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to be attentive to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to remake Dario Argento's classic jallo picture.
The heroes will be returned to wide screens by none other than Michael Bay - the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Dead Men's Day" and filmed "Two Evil Looks" together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing a script for it.
Jennifer Garner, Nick Nolte join Russell Brand, Helen Mirren in 'Arthur' remake of comedy
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China," Chen says.
- Chinese women in our time run big business and win Olympic gold.
Gon Lee embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
Pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I represent two paintings here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi film market - EMRBE).
And in both I play a dream woman.
But... so the director saw me, so he introduced me, and many probably think that I am like that in life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find common ground? What is he like on the court?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought: "Yes... I won't just have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened literally a few minutes after we met.
We are great, I'm not afraid of this word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave this advice and this help to me.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this, because I was very afraid to lose this contact, to lose our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor in childhood I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, some kind of character, its charisma.
And this is the city you want to return to.
He has his provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always manages everywhere.
It turns out that it was easy for you to play in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm an unprofessional actor.
And I am very, by nature, a gullible person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then, in fact, I am entrusted to his hands and I want to be a test from which they will sculpt.
I perfectly understand what I see from the outside, and I, again, ask for tips and talk to the director, for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and very clearly and accurately explains what he needs.
And then in long many hours of rehearsals we come to the organic matter that you are talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I am so pleased to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here there was exactly such a situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, at least thunder, at least hail.
And if something did not work out, it was a disaster, and something urgently needs to be done in order for it to work out.
In this atmosphere of madness, it works very easily.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to painful fanaticism on what they do, it cannot fail, because too much energy is spent.
What scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you have to work?
I do not want nonsense, stupid dialogues, films that say nothing, do not carry anything.
I don't want to work in order to just appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals and plans now.
I am not the person who schedules.
The script came, it interested me, today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously going on in Moscow: American cinema - "Amphest," "2togo\," the other day "2-t-1" will begin, followed by the festival of British cinema.
And here's what is interesting: half of the acquaintances constantly discuss that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, sorry - very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying view of Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
Least of all I want to grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then you will be shown them.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Throne: Legacy" (continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), "Let me in. Saga" (an American remake of a fine Swedish film), "Unruly" (another Tony Scott approach to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how films about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were created.

SOCIAL NETWORK
Facebook Network History
David Fincher's new film is primarily a story about a paradox.
The picture tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire in recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is as great as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a whole host of reasons: partly because of a grudge against the world around him, partly because of sports interest and partly simply because IT is "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of the Social Network become apparent from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) without five minutes: the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are gaining strength here and do not soften until the very finale.
The same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, the actors played unlike each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
Simultaneously with Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara was cast as the lead in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
DIRECTOR David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn from the gate on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few companion friends begin to unravel and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays a role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark, remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate litigation.
Outside the stream of incessant discussion in the film, not so much happens: not a single death, not a single murder, and all Zuckerberg's judicial troubles are unlikely to pull at least an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous story details?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that the "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, only on a larger scale - with space egos and big things.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is stung that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stamping their feet: who said it that the rich, the beautiful and the athletic can't be smart either?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, the "social network" could well turn out a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of ​ ​ popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business - positive or negative?
And what social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a con man?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close a book if there is even the slightest hint of something similar in it.
But here it is not even required: in their version of the story it does not matter at all.
"How does it feel to feel beautiful?" - asked in the song Tre VeaNez "VaBu Uots'te A Vsp Map," preceding the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests an answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea of beauty and even less of feeling.
A tastefully made drama of characters about a high-profile trial of the Internet era
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the names of people of noble origin did not really begin to appear.
Dispensed with the naming "such and such, such and such a son."
That is, there were patronymics in use - nicknames for the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of repeated marriages of the father, they used a matronym - a nickname by the name of the mother.
Susanin - just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna."
Serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why is it when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century. all had surnames without exception.
In the XIX century. even small landowners did not keep the man on the ground, but let him go on a quitrent - let him earn a craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname was to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released for rent.
So, they already had surnames.
Metropolitan criminologists flew to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminologists of the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of a gas explosion in a house at 39 Linearaya, NGS reports.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and, on the contrary, inflated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linear, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the stoves.
So, in one of the apartments they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture occurred in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding thanks to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding due to bad weather in the city sharply increased in St. Petersburg.
Marine surge flooding was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva. Tudey.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold for the level of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by a gusty wind, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again sail along the Gulf of Finland.
Note that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents flooding that may follow increased winds.
In Turkey, 8 people arrested in the case of imperfections in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the discovered construction defects in the buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As reported by Armenpress, Habertürk reports this.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II bomb exploded on Friday, which sappers tried to neutralize.
A powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military bomb disposal personnel were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to defuse it.
Fortunately, the entire staff is intact.
Departments have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no killed or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shores of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before starting attempts to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective shaft of sand around it, and the cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was put up at a distance of 200 meters.
The explosives technicians at first, back on Thursday, were going to cut off the fuse from the bomb with the help of a robot, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, as the local press writes, to use the technique of "slow burning" of explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941 alone, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, Alesya Solovey, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences, told BelTA.
The share of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of ​ ​ scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only the technical sciences are dominated by men, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
Among the teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most women are among senior teachers and teachers - over 60%.
The share of women among associate professors in the departments is also high (55.2%).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, most Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the possibilities of women in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype "science is a male field of activity."
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender ideas about the research competence of women contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovey.
On February 11, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually.

The probability of an increase in the key rate in the future is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following a meeting of his Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently taken place.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing, but budget spending is growing.
At the same time, proinflationary risks generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of raising the rate exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," E. Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of budget policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, the rapid unwinding of consumption in the context of elevated inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, the increasing shortage of workers and the lag of labor productivity growth from wage growth.
And also there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the increase in proinflationary factors noted earlier, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate were increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate increases may be needed so that in 2024 inflation will meet the target near 4%," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (UIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be removed from the existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow you to start managing the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment units.
If there are more than 10% of blocked securities in a retail mutual fund, then the management company must separate them into a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to closed.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to separate the blocked assets into a separate closed-end mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special UIF.
In the future, if such securities are sold, management companies are obliged to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment units on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia the passenger turnover of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines. and capitalize on Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far) in 2023, according to our estimates, passenger traffic will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child died
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
Later it turned out that this is a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified by law enforcement agencies as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is tightening control on the border with Hungary again after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain at the border in cars waiting for it to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the procedure for obtaining asylum in Hungary.
Based on the existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those wishing to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna follows a promise by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the borders of the commonwealth.
According to Frontex, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures for 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 automatic resupply ship successfully docked at the International Space Station at 3.45 GMT on Saturday, ending a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred 269 statute miles above the South Pacific.
The docking was broadcast by NASA Mission Control in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
Cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina greeted the cargo ship from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
Also, the MCC reported that nothing threatens the ISS crew: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, good health."
"Cases of maternity tourism have increased."
How pregnant Russians are stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of having arrived for the purpose of "maternity tourism."
On February 11, they were nevertheless allowed into Argentina by court order.
More details - in the material "Gazeta.Ru."
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit (residence permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
This was told to the TV channel by the C5N director of the service Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permit of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country), "she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russians were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to the refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polina, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were specifically ordered not to enter the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for preventing them from entering the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by a court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation into the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including the EU states, Great Britain and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about the "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russians who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number may grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
It fell in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become 25% more expensive throughout the country, the Patrol of St. Petersburg reports with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
Odnushka cost 25,000 rubles a month, studio - 22,000 rubles a month, two-room - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not let six pregnant Russians into the country, since the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them admitted that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she also cannot clearly tell about where she will go to rest, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions."
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation Alexander Filippenko said that the decision of the Mossovet theater not to renew the contract with him was planned, in addition, everyone agreed in advance with the management.
He told about this in an interview with Interfax.
In the productions in which he took part, invite artists from the second composition.
People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that back in 2022 his contract ended.
All details have long been agreed with representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenko noted that the authorities went to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that "he did not let anyone down."
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor in the Moscow theater works as a guest actor.
According to the publication, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such performances as "Shakespeargamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew," "Uncle Vanya," as well as "Three Sisters."
On Friday, February 10, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from the territories of the private sector in the Kalinin Autonomous Okrug.
This information was shared at the city hall.
At the moment, in the Kalininsky district there are more than four hundred streets of the private sector, from which it is necessary to remove snow by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on February fifteenth, and the second will be held from March first to April fifteenth.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleaning.
Authorities reported that contractors are faced with bringing snow onto the roadway by residents of houses.
Kirkorov won the trial against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man declared the illegality of the artist's construction, but did not appear at the meeting.
The fisherman was suing the music performer Philip Kirkorov because of the allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Channel Five writes about this.
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As the head of the law office, Alexander Dobrovinsky, clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was filed on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from that place there is an opportunity to spin further.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about food and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "ragged," which means that they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop drinking caffeine-containing foods 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of the excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties arise with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages contribute to relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy food in bulk portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to comply with the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you should not abuse heavy food before going to bed, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activity, so it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's rival in the upcoming presidential election: In the world: Politics: INFOX.ru
According to the agency, the main competitor of the ex-president in the upcoming elections will be Florida Governor Ron Desantis.
Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to enter the fight for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, the Desantis team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential election and conducting preliminary polls.
In support of this, Bloomberg reports on a retreat scheduled for late February for Republican Party leaders and government officials.
The agency says the Florida governor's team is seeking support among fellow Republicans from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts named Desantis as Donald Trump's main potential competitor.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well known enough so that he does not have to start an election campaign right now, and in addition, they note his ability to raise money.
Ron Desantis advocated the nomination of Donald Trump for the presidency in 2017, and in the upcoming presidential elections in November 2024, he could compete with him.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again..." during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
The incumbent President Joe Biden, despite the assurances of his team about his intention to take part in the 60s presidential elections, said there was no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media reported.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters last Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization," the trade unions hope this time to bring more protesters to the streets, taking into account those citizens who did not have the opportunity to participate in the demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect in the country from 600 thousand to 800 thousand demonstrators, including in Paris - from 90 thousand to 120 thousand, the media write.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in actions against pension reform, according to the French Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The largest trade union association - the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) - announced 2 million demonstrators.
Also, according to the CGT, 400 thousand protesters took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000.
On the previous day of protests on January 31, the number of protesters was 1.27 million, according to the police, and 2.8 million according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are scheduled for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elizabeth Born presented a draft pension reform developed by the government, which provides for an increase in the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is assumed that the established retirement age threshold will gradually shift from 62 years to 64 to three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will be applied, starting with generations of French born in September 1961 or after.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced during the election campaign in 2022 that he was determined to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential mandate.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's pension reform project.

The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further ISS flight program.
The situation was commented on by the executive director of Roscosmos for manned space programs Sergei Krikalev.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a coolant leak from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to the ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS note) in mid-December, "he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with Soyuz came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to make sure there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to do a deep analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to such structures at future launches.
This is the most important task that will be facing us now," he said.
According to the executive director, an analysis is to be carried out in terms of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic mistake," Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that a commission began work on Saturday, which will analyze all possible reasons.
"The ship was supposed to be undocked and de-orbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - TASS note), therefore, serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew... From this point of view, this will not affect the program," Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, he docked at the small research module "Search" of the ISS Russian segment.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.

NASA believes that all the coolant is completely gone.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the coolant leak stopped," said a representative of the American MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, due to depressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the astronauts.
"Progress MS-22" docked to the ISS today, February 11, will take it out of orbit, according to the plan, February 18.

Deputy Director General of Russian Railways proposed to the Governor of the Irkutsk Region to master new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales areas, except for the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by the Deputy Director General of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reports on February 10, 2023.

The Governor noted the importance of stability of product shipment, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resources of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of traffic.

It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often the issue of stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already the basis for turning off the power supply.
Therefore, now network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - emphasized Konstantin Zaitsev.

Crossing on Armenian-Turkish border opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alidjan border checkpoint on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the earthquake.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same transition was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating 1988 earthquake, the Turkish Anadolu agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative at the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kılıç said.
He expressed gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the region affected by the earthquake," Kylych wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish agency Anadolu cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alidjan border checkpoint was last used to supply humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
Then the aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and 29 more rescuers to Syria in the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that happened on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that it is already known from 21,848 deaths in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are overshadowed mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country citizens as soon as possible.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a vessel that had previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The maritime command of Tarragona of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the Maersk Magellan from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan, because the cargo it carries comes from the Cameroon-flagged Nobel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was adopted in accordance with the legislation of the European Union, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022 or changed the flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the check was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.

Problems with pregnant Russians entering Argentina explained
According to the specialist, against the background of the influx of people wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russians into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
It is reported by "Лента.ру" with reference to the professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Kheifets, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America."
According to him, no country supports such practices.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point, and not into a final one.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will remain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to provide an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina provides citizenship under the "right of the soil," that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free visits to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to recall the residence permit of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false data on the motives for the trip.
Russia predicts the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, the interest of citizens in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mainly small-format ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, in an interview with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of ​ ​ more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts give other figures.
According to Kontur.Fokus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity "work of a fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but back in 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators.
A license was taken away from the management company from Kirov
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region canceled the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings, issued by the management company "Care."
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the Zabota management company was canceled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it entered into legal force only in February 2023.
Arbitration deprived the "management" license for the fact that the organization several times ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were under the management of "Care" are excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They turned to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Anti-monopoly officers allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for by the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to write off money from remote cards without notifying the client if payment from others does not go through for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that settlements with buyers are carried out with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although a water cooler would not hurt to get more.
Came 2 times, everything is fine!
I wish all employees peace, kindness, good luck and a decent salary, at this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply incomparable!!!)
Highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A nice cashier asked me to make me a coffee, 200 or 300 ml, with me or in the hall.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted in ceramics, therefore "in the hall."
I was made with myself.
I ask why in a glass, not a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they do not have 300 ml cups.
This is how it fits in a person's head?
Ask with yourself or in the hall, i.e. for yourself to determine the technology: pour coffee into a cup or in a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the scope.
Hear that 300 ml.
Put a person before the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Circle in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Cafeteria Green Okolitsa and Green Okolitsa - the sides of the same medal or organization are not connected with each other in any way?
If not related, understanding appears.
If related - why did the food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality descend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazan station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, is happening to me for the third time.
I do not exclude what is happening not only with me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she acts on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to enter the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with children, nephews.
You like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location is very convenient.
From almost any point, the arena is visible and the backs in front of those sitting do not interfere with you.
The circus is very chamber, family!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
Many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, they invited me to see the complex, when there were not even walls, so that you could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and not a single developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort in Russia!
The most high is the gentle sparse forests uh, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short for me.
The longest on sector e, there are even less.
But overall great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Great Peri master!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cabin is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the appendix and wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today in business such a service is unacceptable!
The response of the "care" service is we try.
At the checkout even without apology, just - we are not to blame, this is a program.
Neither call to warn, you have not found any other technical possibilities for communication with regular previously loyal customers.
Impotents are trying, and business must work.
Thank you all, we all disperse.
We will not order more from you, and even more so.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies to the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to get the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but the fact turned out to be 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary dishes.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the shortcomings, there is only too little space in the bathroom, a terribly small shower.
Places for storing snowboards or skis are not provided, and there is nowhere to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and cram it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so, in general, a good option in a calm place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those wishing to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Great place with very polite staff, will definitely come again.
Facilities include parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, prices are low, and quality is at the level!
Very responsive staff, will tell and answer all questions)
I recommend this store for everyone to visit! ❤ ️
Location as convenient for anyone.
For me personally, normal.
Serve quickly if any of the visitors are not stupid.
The recording is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will tell you, they will guide you, they will advise you even if you did not come on reception days.
In principle, normal.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was quickly done, prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was for release, and they did everything to me so clever.
Many thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8th.
After 6 hours, they brought flowers in packaging, as if stolen (barely enough pieces of paper to wrap flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
Compared with a photo on the site and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there are an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in Votsap for my indignation about the color and number of colors answered "apparently confused the color."
The next day I wrote again and was offered a refund of 15%.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that they refused to give me a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, for dyeing and hair cutting.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always happy with her work.
She will always listen carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I safely recommend this master to all family and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!"
Huge Savbo to Master Samira ★ ★
I was welcomed in this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if we take the "usual gameplay," then the computers do not pull well: (
Therefore, a score of 4 → →
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to study in his group, and his mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
Administrators are super attentive, coaches are professional.
Arrange thematic holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and simulators.
It's nice to walk and study.

Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blon with keratin!
And your hair will tell you THANK YOU ★ ★ ★ ★
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she clearly explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all possible assistance.
And also gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out efficiently.
The only thing that was embarrassing when recording for maintenance was insufficiently correct information on the work regulations; when attending maintenance, the regulations were more clearly clarified.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the employees of the Administration.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate deal, the employees very kindly met and helped to draw up this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not their responsibility.
Thanks a lot!
Very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, did not regret that she came to this particular hairdresser! ⠀ ⠀
Master Nahida did impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone
I liked it very much in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
By the 800th anniversary, everything is restored, inside everything is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly wonderful lecture
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, they saw how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged people, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/taken away by zoo taxi.
And also bring clean and tasty)
generally a fairy tale ★ ★
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude to our pets ❤ ️ ❤ ️
Restaurant Fed Elk is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
Prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book places in advance, especially on Fridays!
Cute manicured zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were an adult 300 ″ on weekdays, a student 170.
There were few people, they walked with pleasure, looked at the animals.
Anteater impressed)
in Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean free, they also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend ❤ ️
Salon at the highest level!!!
I am very pleased with the services of the cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.

Satisfied 100%.
Master of his craft ★ ★
Everything tells in detail about the peculiarities of the skin, selected cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfect.
I walk now satisfied and beautiful!!!
Thanks Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, pool, sauna, hamam and great coaches!
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It seems that they come to the club as in a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I put the top three and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I can be wrong.
He designed everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything is intelligible, the son also decided to issue a card, and alas, consultants are busy with their business, clients are waiting, a consultant approached his son in the end, to whom everything is up to a light bulb, several times returned to the meeting room, discussing something cheerfully, as a result, the son left without registering anything, the consultant said for forgiveness, well, whatever you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
The new office, in a new format, is all comfortable and this attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of pellets), the staff knows their assortment, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slender and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are not far from the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend!
Was in September, celebrated his birthday.
In principle, I liked everything in terms of service and quality of food: prices are low, portions are medium in size, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
It was lucky that there were free places and managed to accommodate us.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
Recommend!
Went to the purge on a recent weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff that was as sensitive as possible to many of my questions, suggested how and what is best to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I sincerely recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat up for money in my memory.
Nice mall.
There is everything!
A large assortment of goods.
Variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
not a foot more into this shop.
we bought a washing machine, they told us what kind of city we were, so we'll take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to drive up to the warehouse, to the question "immersed"? said yes.))
in the warehouse carried out without a box, when asked why? answered that so everything is loaded.
when I began to insist, they stuck two strips of foam, like and so it will come down!
they refused to load into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
when she said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said "yes, whatever you want, we don't care," in the end one still went down to go down the ramp and help his father push the car into the trailer.
this is the first time I come across such boorish service.
Nice shopping mall Clean neat. large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" entertainment children's center "Nevidalia."
On the lower floor is a large Lenta hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and homewares.
Varied assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
Good place to spend the evening.
Staff very nice, nice place.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in choosing. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go super.
I advise you to visit)
We express our gratitude to Sentinel Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on call, she took upon herself the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed how things were going.
Thanks to her, we saw off a loved one with dignity.
Everything was decorated, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the condition of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and just humanly sympathized with us.
This is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
Flattered by the many good reviews, I turned to RemStirMash and was appointed master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for services.
Everyone discussed and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a difficult application (how is it? and where is "completely free?") And, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander he can come, but in 2 hours.
What are these tricks?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all planned cases to the side!
In short, the intelligent master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which thanks to him.
So don't get fooled by empty promises and waste your time.
Evening observations did not meet expectations at all.
At first there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then they looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to watch several times, the adults crowded and could not let others see.
The objects that we looked through the telescope were the size of a regular star, and without a telescope you can see for free.
The girl did not answer the questions very easily, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
The stunning location, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit, eating 2-3 dishes for two (porky very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 p
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequilla, for example, Macho Boracho highly recommend trying.
Price 420 p per 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself has a very tasty cuisine, I don't know how to others, but I really liked it, I will advise my friends to go there)
An excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, from the very opening.
Good quality goods.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they made global repairs in the apartment, everything they needed was taken here.
Great dressing!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is also a guard of the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I refuel 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eagles on the card and for cash, on the litter do not deceive.
Shop, liked it!
You can choose any model, at an affordable price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always ready to help in choosing.
I took a laptop to my daughter for study, because her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! ​ ​
A sommelier works.
he helped with the choice of wine, because it is difficult to figure out such a large menu yourself.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - magically, respect to the cook.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, she's here FIRE!
Adults appreciated with truffle, and children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - this is a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
Staff are nice, all smiling, friendly.
We loved it.

Solid 5.
Wonderful puppetry.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the Play "The Frog Princess."
At the moment, of the children's performances, this is the best.
It was very interesting, a lot of dolls, special effects.
Even the son is 14 years old, he just went for the company, and said that he was a very good performance.
We rested with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
Rest was a success on "5," I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, clarified what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850p), arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us behind the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, decorated quickly, minutes a 15-20.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The 2-seater room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two armchairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
Building 5 has a lot of green plants.
Everything is clean, changing towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, you still change for the 4th day, good quality linen.
The territory is well-groomed, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus drives to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
Public transport stop 5 min.
There are friendly guys in the dining room, they always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, everything suits us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and minced collops or the like, vegetables for a side dish every day, pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, that's just cheese and sausage not very.
The medical staff are very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 ° C, the sun.
I liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the training complex.
Thanks to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to Flight since August.
Docha turned 4 in September.
She really likes everything, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I could never have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering along the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising institution - and we did not lose!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, even the crust does not remain.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend:)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarov hospital with pressure and a high heartbeat.
And she was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is deetic but great!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, they all put on intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While there is a dropper, they will come in and ask about their well-being...
Previously, it was possible to make an ultrasound of the heart, but so that for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; picked up the dosage and drugs, from which both pressure and heartbeat returned to normal, which previously could not be achieved after contacting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, and sanitizers, and repetitions!
When visiting the client service, the impression remained good.
In the hall met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists quickly and patiently help clients on all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various trifles.
Works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool when the city has a place to ride from the mountains.
Lifts yoke and on weekends of course the queue is going 40 seconds down and 5-10 minutes queue.
But overall cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positive and winter, even if there is dirt and dampness on the roads.
I turned to the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and a battery replacement was required.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price frames.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done with high quality.
The masters are very pleasant to communicate, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was hit, focus lost.
Immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was fixed as soon as possible, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are acceptable.
If you need repair again, I will definitely contact you!
Mashtabno, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the state requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Excellent railway
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a good, cozy resting place in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
Slaughter and varied in terms of food court.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
No crowding.
Well, we visited, tried...
The interior has nothing to do with the Italian cozy cafe...
There are very few places, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... well, who has not tasted better, he will like it to me it seemed like some kind of faceless.
I did not really like the fact that the waiter always stands behind your back and your interlocutor opposite almost always looks into the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We will not come here again and will not recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best master I have ever cut and painted.
He does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The cabin atmosphere is amazing.
Thanks a bunch!
Nizhny and I broke down on the way, kind people from KatResurs quickly reacted and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there would be more such good people!
And in the service there is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year for the planned concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff are nice and helpful!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ‍
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, one dust remains.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which unfortunately is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, understandable layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at Perekrestok.
The staff are welcoming.
I didn't get bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I am glad that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Were at the bar twice, liked everything, polite staff, tasty food and most importantly - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only, second time disappoints the soloist of the group "Hands Up Band."
Not only does not really sing softly, but also reads the text of most songs from the phone, it was especially striking when these were songs of the Hands Up group.
Somehow it is illogical (speaking in the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band).
We rested in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room overlooking the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and changing towels.
Breakfasts just fell off their heads.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant to the room, pay 20% from above for service.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced.
To taste for three plus.
The water park was included in the price of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help to open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on to keep the brand.
Great place to get together with friends to steam.
Large and comfortable steam room, there is billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
Workshop on the level!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
All right.
Quality of work at height.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Great basketball school!
The son walks for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great store location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
Good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often happen - everything suits!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically about the "frog," Our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hairdryers!
I love cupcake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always on point.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish and just left.
Last time I had a long black hair in my coffee, replaced.
Please be more careful, as in no way I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows this way!
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all fluff well, and eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected by type and hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts for a long time.
Better not to make eyebrows!
Thank you so much for the organized move of my mother!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top notch.
For a long time we have been treating teeth with the whole family in Novodent.
Recently, my son's teeth were treated for 8 years, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues. reception by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something harmful only here and only here.
Tasty, fresh meat is a lot of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows with me.
Often, when you finish eating shawarma, you can't eat the bottom anymore, since there is a bunch of water sauce, well, in short..., but not here.
Therefore guys you are the best ❤ ️
Good teaching staff.
The dining room is always fed fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice shop, polite staff, good assortment.
However, a big disadvantage is that the goods that are brought in are apparently destroyed right in the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is looked after with reverence.
I got double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the house of culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really an outing.
Looking for a clutch kit on his MB Sprinter.
I accidentally got into this online auto parts store.
I called, indicated the wincode, they said wait)
In minutes 10 called back, offered several options.
Since the car personally did not save money and asked to order a good set of LUK clutch.
After another 5 minutes they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + squeeze, but take the LUK kit basket + disk and separately squeeze LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Taking the clutch went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it turned out that a flywheel was still needed and the faster the better.
I already knew where I was going), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on a call (for the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was on hand.
The car is pleased with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly that we went to the meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out they put me at a 4-seater table.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just strange that they didn't warn.
Kitchen for four, fish failed at all.
Leading with contests made at the top of the school level, to be honest, not very.
BUT everything is perfect about music.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like quibbles.
Thank you for the event
I leave my feedback with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB department and in the maternity department, and in the department after childbirth.
But I express special gratitude to E.Yu. Kotlyarova, this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and N.V. Yarantseva, this is a midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Lovely shop.
A large assortment of balls, always quick order formation and delivery.
Professional employees.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the institution on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, a little cheeky waiters, but we were in a great lineup with the kids and celebrating an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery presentation of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for a good kitchen.
