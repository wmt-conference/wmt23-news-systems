Diego Cocca is the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post. He only took over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht is blooming" also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering islands are to be created on which insects can find food at all times. "If the weather is good, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He has his own beehives on the property.
So that the undertaking does not just remain an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also extends widely into private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed next to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started
Shrubs such as winter honeysuckle and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone are more recent. They have been in the pots on Bergedorer Strasse for a year now, are just showing the first tender blossoms in white and pink and have recently been given additional signs. "The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad-bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there under further information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not just the bedding plants that are showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started. It blooms particularly profusely on the Richtweg uphill, on Gutenbergstrasse, Wilhelm-Holert-Strasse, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich – dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her when he looks down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the "Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap tapping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked together with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
At 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the Ostbahnhof dance studio. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome with us".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, eat healthy and don't drink alcohol".
Analogue in dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, some people's desire for analog is growing again
The speed with which our everyday life became digital gave us hardly any time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to them, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a phone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic handset and the click of the small change coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do this. Previously, Recean was one of the President's advisors.
Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned after only a year and a half in office. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hostile to pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023 there will be a proper celebration in Veitshöchheim. Season 5 is in full swing and the celebrities didn't need to be asked twice.
Country father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder in Bavaria. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Environment and Consumer Protection Minister, Thorsten Faithr, chose the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely aloof: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
State President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Minister of Finance Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, District Administrator of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-boss Ludwig Hartmann as a Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD faction leader's desire: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he will certainly speak more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side Mrs. Andrea.
If politics doesn't work anymore, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermine.
On the move as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig at the climate activists by Franconian crime scene inspector Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be missing either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is catching up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even the sometimes heavy fog did not prevent the long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay was enough to successfully defend the title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the chase race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to make up for mistakes in shooting with frightening ease to a certain extent.
At Doll, meanwhile, nothing went together again. After the veteran lost all chances of a medal with a penalty loop in the mixed relay and only finished sixth, things didn't go any better three days later. Three penalties in prone and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest of the German team, who celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago he surprisingly won in Hochfilzen with a lead of 0.7 seconds before Bö. It was one of just three career successes Dolls has had on the podium this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "We have to stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is all about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
Left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump broke into Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much attention to international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and night," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Quick note to the press - Friday
Anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? On it you could see the members of the Red Army Faction who had been released for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was raised against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because in this world, which includes Asia, Africa and Latin America, there are perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's: Ms. Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this sheet. If so, now is the time. We have reached the known level, where nothing is below.
And by now, good dialectic, Frau Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all people who are not yet completely stupid, ie peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have split up. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There it says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership through his family lawyer with the competent court. I will not comment on the details".
Glööckler and his partner Schroth have been together for 35 years, and there have been rumors of separation for about a year. After participating in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have moved to Berlin from the common house in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacres in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which remain. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for German-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here the residents find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorbikes roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup every day - and some of them straight back again.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "The inflationary risks are still great. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and announced a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the March 16 meeting. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher interest rates on loans can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are far more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although inflation slowed again in January, consumer prices in the currency area, which now has 20 countries, were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a key driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation stays high, private consumption will "slump sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it, and it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end there will be a set of rules that does not necessarily have to go as quickly as with the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year - but not as slowly as before.
After ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened in mid-December. The aim was to close the gap in the gas supply due to a lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new “Germany pace” on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of the approval process for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters most. But that shouldn't automatically mean that from now on we'll always act categorically and put a wind turbine in the garden of our neighbors against their will." said Harting. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, the classic set of rules was tried and failed. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was really correct. Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for us".
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Union warns of breaking up the Bayer group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of boss at Bayer. "From the employee's point of view, Bayer is in the right position with its three pillars for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, member of the board of the union and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health area with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The 2018 takeover of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes into the house about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer stock has been falling for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It has long been known that Baumann is not looking to extend his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had exerted the pressure. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for aggressive action. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions countered a government plan with massed protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
Hundreds of thousands of people are again expected across the country on Saturday in France who want to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. A turbulent debate has been going on in parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France are already working beyond the age of 62 if they have not paid long enough to earn a full pension when they reach retirement age. In many strenuous occupations, people could hardly work longer, say opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health on the job.
Macron: Looming pension fund deficit
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations and say the state must find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government doesn't just want to tighten the retirement age. The increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. A number of presidents before Macron had tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were certain.
With Macron's camp no longer enjoying an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the MPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be even greater than the fear of a tight vote at the moment. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to ensure that they passed calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does that mean plenty of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
Calm high-pressure weather is expected in Germany at least until the middle of the week. "When you look at the weather maps, you immediately see a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Ubel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Ubel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands days of dreary foggy grayness, while there is pure sun in the highlands of the low mountain ranges".
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens over the course of the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it will remain cloudy or overcast like high fog. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, nibbles at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected on the Lower Rhine, while only 3 degrees are expected in the permanent gray in the south-east. In addition, there is a weak wind blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday in some lowlands there may again only be a sluggish dissipation of fog or high fog. Otherwise the weather will be clear after the fog has cleared. According to the forecasts, the sun will shine all day at high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps. Depending on the sunshine, the temperatures climb to between 5 and 11 degrees.
Dominator quarrels: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Meribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," said the Italian on ZDF after merging a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent what could have been a serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait a little longer for a World Championship medal in her flagship discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they aren't."
Missing girl in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information on their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in finding a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the premises of her school at around 12.30 p.m. on February 10, 2023 together with other children in the direction of the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local area.

Zelenskyy and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint conference call, they agreed to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of Great Britain. British Sport Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it was a very productive meeting. "And I have made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on the matter."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and cannot be carried.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelenskyj called on the officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which "unfortunately has lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it wanted to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes Athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior when asked by dpa.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for athletes from both countries to return to the international sports stage under neutral flags, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently declared that an exclusion “because of a passport or place of birth” violates the ban on discrimination.
Chalk it up where it happens
"Hey, hot butt!", whistling at the fool in a tight, sexy costume and shouting suggestive remarks: all of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term hides nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's armored stock severely depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? The US sees Moscow's tank inventory severely depleted
The Pentagon understands that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the Russian army's main stock of tanks" was "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event held by the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks confiscated and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is set to receive main battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks in March. In a coalition with other countries, Germany plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, your delivery will most likely take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging for planes, missiles and tanks abroad," said Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment, including modern tanks."
A law has been in force in Russia since last summer that enables the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Eddy about occupation of posts in the army
Because the post that the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
According to the minister, an advertisement is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously vacant position. She did not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been eliminated.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current security policy issues.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The "appearance of Postenschacher" is responsible for the decision, says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos urge Tanner to rescind the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in a swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel at the expense
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone made up about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, probably East Germany's largest again, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were canceled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors are not found or the previous ones contribute even more, reserves would have to be tapped - "that doesn't work every year". The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: Some confectionery prices have increased by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnachtszug support association. Due to luck in disguise, too many were ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will be more expensive. Twice as many staff are needed for security than in 2020.
Those who stand by the wayside on the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train passengers don't have as much with them. Camels or not, the rush of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain cats and dogs that day, then we can definitely expect an increased rush of people," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Shrove Monday procession for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the procession."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on the costs in detail. The train is generally "deficit", that's no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
It's not for nothing that the Ukrainians are hard-drinking. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely available. Here they burn it mainly in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But that's only true if it goes into mass sale. Then there will probably also be a mess.
FC Hansa Rostock rewarded for great effort: "Match luck on our side"
to eat and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work, you will find great places in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorites win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals in the Oberhof World Cup sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a grin, referring to the wafts of fog that kept drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed visiting the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Fascinated since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race me the biathlon", he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have lent a hand here since the World Cup was awarded". When it comes to sustainability, the location is now "a step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again surpassed the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and with it his second world title in Oberhof. Behind him, his clean-shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty loop/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after one miss and a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed game on Wednesday, the Black Forester missed five targets this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö started the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However: With his last two standing shots he had the luck of the capable; they landed on the edges of the disks and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will continue to dominate Sunday's pursuit. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There's only full throttle and attack to defend number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling said about his "locomotive". The organizers are expecting an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on dropped ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors on the part of the players who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We decided that we don't want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. We'll pay more attention to that again - and will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson saw the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow and red. "Coaching behavior also falls under the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has increased in this area as well, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that the coaches and referees worked well together. "Overall, the relationship is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with that. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotionality during the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into personal disparagement, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a general rethinking process were to start that such behavior is simply not appropriate," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro WINS in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country race, the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes are not at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are training in Oberstdorf to prepare for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21st to March 5th in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after a rear-end collision on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police report, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage in the Marl Sculpture Museum
They brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
An unusual exhibition ends on Sunday, February 12th in the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wall-bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transition quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-mounted art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to 1970s.
dr Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and did her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting in the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in architecture in NRW. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It's about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants had been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the building.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly arrested at Istanbul Airport. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
A 7.7 magnitude tremor shook the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 magnitude tremor at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing faction in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party is losing "an important personality," said parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers - for around 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Up until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of establishing German unity was a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically". German unity was accomplished too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and it was condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
what happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
KIEV - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's power grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants had been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region looks particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was throttled at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian rocket attacks continued into Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, the air alarm was triggered for the fifth time late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," said the military administration of the Kiev region. Iranian-made combat drones were also sighted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company was agreed, which, however, should in future be oriented towards the common good. This means that it does not need to generate or pay off any profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the train is currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely overhauling entire railway corridors. The investments that are necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof 2023 – gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
The external circumstances apparently did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, was "totally excited" and her pulse hadn't slowed down as soon as she walked in. "Such a race", and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe it in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy the biathlon", that's what she had planned
The pressure was particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old started as the biggest, if not the only German hope for a medal outside of the relays in the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She is currently fifth in the overall World Cup. And even if the power density is significantly higher among the women at the top than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians are currently dominating, you had other people on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the 2018 protests. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the years that followed, often for fear of reprisals or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been canceled, and the same is threatening other projects, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to allocate concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says the Federal Government in response to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, there is less money available for specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining amount is falling.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit in the direction of Heilbronn. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, the police said. The two vehicles collided when the BMW driver made a turn.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no objections. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars suffered material damage totaling around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarter commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. De sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with one another. The congregation also asked for support and strength "to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers of supplication were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of the Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already been raised in the fundraising campaign of the German Islam Association, the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in kind over a period of several days in Glockenstrasse, which are to be trucked to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older people know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, the good old digestive walk experienced an unexpected renaissance during the pandemic years. Because those who, thanks to the home office, are not in the middle of a stone desert, but rather only a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, can now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort.
One reason could, of course, also be that people in modern times can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of making optimal use of their time slot. After all, why not learn news about the settlement from a neighbor you haven't seen for a long time on a short hike through nature? Or meet that girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Work and private life can also be combined in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do excellently is the acquisition of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to a small cash register on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. It's only stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken the appropriate precautions. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg left the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "Too bad, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you also let the likeable chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You certainly have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly puts on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with a piece of meat and on this short midday excursion you have not only gained a saddle of lamb, but also an extremely practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and badly injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for reasons that have not yet been clarified, left the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a delineator, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled that the tax authorities must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the USA
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the ministry's decision said on Friday.
Contrary to political practice in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a release up to the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information leaks out of Parliament from time to time.
House Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a national security issue, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as President," Pelosi said.

British criminal caught in Thailand after long escape
LONDON - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug criminal has been arrested in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's Most Wanted list.
The leader of a criminal group fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth £8million, authorities said.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the qualified physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, takes a stand for science in his cabaret programmes. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing scientific skepticism here at home. In any case, his sense of humor suits Vienna very well.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian for a year in 2019. But now he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do and, above all, what it can't do. Of course there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, calm and very ironic. And so we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the point of view of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and blocks of rock that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles that become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction procedure, the game initiation procedure, the game procedure, the initial entry for maximum scores, and the self-test procedure. The latter operating mode represents a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
Game play is initiated when the START button is pressed. The LED switch stays lit and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left corner of the hint display of his cockpit. A hint can read, for example: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. Additionally, a dot will appear on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, representing the enemy position.
The top cone on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. At the same time, ENEMY IN THE FIRE AREA is shown in the upper left information display.
At times, UFO's will appear on screen flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that monitor the battle and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are awarded: for a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A Super Tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for one game. Furthermore, a bonus tank can be released after a given number of points has been reached and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the gameplay selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial entry for top scores
If a player exceeds the minimum score on the high score table, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials on the table after the game has ended. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or an interruption in mains power will clear the maximum results table. Upon RESET, the ten (10) highest scores are preserved with their initials and written back onto the screen to challenge other players. Any score greater than 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by the computer. The device then switches back to the attraction gameplay. BODY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you are already familiar with Atari video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shifter. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer shells, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper operation of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back to the center position. The microswitches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuitry has been expanded to two (2) interconnected circuit boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and Auxiliary Boards. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and smooth picture. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to handle the increased power supply given the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. There is also a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players in order to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all the other main components of this device, are shown in figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Still, you should do some verification to round out the quality control. In order to be certain that the device was delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect the exterior of the case for damage. B. Open the unit service hatch and check the components inside the unit as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for proper and tight connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never use force to connect plugs. The plugs are forced-guided so that a correct connection is established. A connector twisted 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm seating. (3) Note the serial number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped serial numbers match those on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Controller/Audio II PC Board and TV Monitor. An illustration showing the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be quoted when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control panel and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's sight glass, check that the radar screen is also in the fairing's bright orange circled opening. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selection plug on the mains unit 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you resolve most issues related to the latest DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the box. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you are unsure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please do the following to launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Type "dxdiag" in the text box. The DirectX Diagnostics program's interface will now appear. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check whether the graphics and sound are working properly, by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound Note: Unless you have advanced computer skills, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostics program Before starting the game
Other programs may be hogging the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many start automatically when the system boots. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. That's why we recommend you to close such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close" or similar). - Once you have disabled antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also kill common background applications as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the How to Quit All Unnecessary Background Applications section. Clean up the system
Before you install any software, you need to make sure your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup to keep things running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run largely problem-free on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and other applications that you use run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows help files for information about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and choose Help (or Help and Support) to open Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the appropriate keyword, e.g. B. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a guide explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing CTRL, ALT and DEL the Windows Security window does not appear, but the Windows Task Manager appears immediately Windows XP Home
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard, and then press DEL. The Windows Task Manager will now appear. 2. To end a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click on the corresponding entry in the task list and then click on the "End task" button. Before calling the hotline
If you want to make a call, you should sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see the “Checking the system configuration” section). Please also prepare notes. - PC brand and model - processor type - operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - information about graphics and sound cards and drivers
INTRODUCTION TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities and seemed like a new means of expression to push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: while I was struggling with the still immature technology, I was also aware that there was still everything to be discovered - in particular a new language, the had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years didn't satiate my hunger. I had a vague feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and ignoring a fundamental element of human experience: sensation. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid advances. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, sensuous medium of expression. While this could of course have been done in a very different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just about battling hideous monsters in dark corridors and banging on crates to get ammo, but about far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and provide game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you're skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your mindset. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. For the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has provided the entire Quantic Dream team with an unforgettable human and intellectual adventure, one that has repeatedly forced us to question many of the principles we once believed to be unbreakable . I would be lucky if Fahrenheit - like books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - doesn't entirely pass by without a trace. David Cage
THE README FILE

SERVICE MANUAL QIX
gameplay
By pressing the appropriate start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. Trying to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The course of the game is set in such a way that a minimum required area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In the event of an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER SPARX and more aggressive. If while trying to draw your area your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed as you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and don't complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, providing data and demonstrating that circuits and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally. The 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program screen. insert programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the start of the game can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" button. The factory or basic setting can be reached by pressing the "Sub-Test" button several times, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" button". The values are reset, the pointer ( so called the lines that appear green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to set the High Score points transmit the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits needed for a player to enter their own initials (names) and hit points on the screen. The "Max of Credit" sets a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the limit is exceeded - if coin lock is present - coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that inserting a coin will not cause the credits to become zero when adding over 99. A free spins mode can be selected by setting "Max Credits" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": Level of the percentage that must be reached in order to switch to the next run
"Time Limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Degree of difficulty of the gameplay
"Pull-on tone": at "0" no tone during stationary operation
with "1" sound also in stationary mode (animated sound) "table model": with "0" stationary device
with "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "Slot Programming" screen. High score program display (high hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the 10 nearest scores. The values are used to set the high score chosen on the previous display (set from "back"). By pressing the "Up" button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" button The switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of credits paid The total is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over The total can only appear as 0 , when the battery or connector W1 is removed, with the device switched off Left-side coins: number of coins inserted - in the left coin slot - Middle coins: (none) Right-side coins: number of coins inserted - in the right coin slot. Credits Paid: Number of credits given for inserted (converted coins). Credits Granted: Number of credits granted by the device. % Free Spins: Credits Granted (Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Minutes Won: Number of minutes when the game was extended or won. % Free Time: Minutes Gained/Minutes Played per 100. Average Game Time in Sec: Minutes Played/Credits Paid + Granted
High Score: Number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. The values are set to 0 by pressing the "Up" switch. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. Using this display, a default coin setting can be selected by the operator, or a different setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons will select programming while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is accepted. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is required, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that you can set your own. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the adjustment is made, any new variable to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If you press it unintentionally, the standard setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" buttons. The process is ended by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted - through an assigned slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM where all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in RAM are restored to factory defaults. This condition probably indicates battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the 'Sub-Test' button or the 'Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display , by pressing the "Test” button the next program is displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test starts in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is powered off When the message "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1-2 must be inserted. If connector J 19 is removed, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be carried out Hardware tests: These tests are carried out as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM contains errors, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the integrity of the memory shared by two processors by storing a predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error can be caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To localize the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are written to another part of memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test passes, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the circuits connected to them or the decoding.
Test video board color RAM by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original template. Any discrepancy will halt the program and the LED's will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test is starting (data hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must exist and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for Star #1. The 2nd for the correct jacket arriving with no apparent seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I based myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to be so tight and I didn't want to fight my bust size into an S or M... In the end it would have fit in terms of length and hips... I could swim the rest of the way. In addition, the lining material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she absolutely loves it. She usually wears the 158 and in this case the 36 fits her quite well and will definitely be worn again next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that's not ideal. Unfortunately, I took my measurements and the edition doesn't quite fit. But what is my fault. Then I changed it a bit to make it fit. The pad is very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again right away.
Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months we have picked him out again and he can use him. Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with the few teeth he already has. And when he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Insufficient quality / unfortunately has to be returned
I guess I was fooled by some of the raving reviews here. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing gear) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that (as written in many reviews) it can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at far higher prices.... folks, that's just not true! I really hoped that would be the case, but there's really no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and don't offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more flimsy. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly of high quality either. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to pay for a decent backpack. Apparently, quality has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like it was a difficult decision for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far I've enjoyed EL Todd's Electrics series best, but this book has changed my mind. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. That part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I felt it was unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then every time he fights, he's like a little kid and rips off?! At the same time there were also discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he heard it myself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last installment in the series and I think this installment is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would add more excitement to the story.
People destroy everything, don't appreciate anything and don't learn! First of all: The film isn't that bad as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed and designed according to the same pattern over and over again. If you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: people destroy everything and don't appreciate anything and don't learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often did I just think about the film (even though I know that it's just a film and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes . So Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that the man just doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and us too. Out of greed and greed, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living things: none. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always based on the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film isn't a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't intend to be one. This film is primarily "French" - it's also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90's, because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. A packet every morning for 5 days: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has increased by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite stopping immediately, the diarrhea has been there for a week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger full 5? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blond hair a chocolate brown in October with an intensive tint, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I have used the product twice. The first time I noticed it smelled terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfactory. This time it was a complete waste of time! It didn't make a difference, my hair looked like it did the first time. Worst of all, it still stunk weeks after using it.. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended
I've been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an additional, longer illness. I wanted to give my immune system a little boost not only with a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets for. Highly Recommended.
Not working properly!!! After using the battery case for 3 months, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) Over time, the case has problems "connecting" to the cell phone. This means that it is no longer loaded even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and putting it back in solves the problem in 70% of cases, but creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the cell phone in the case, the cover has become so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. These aren't many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the price of €30, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially since I've only had it for 3 months use.
Far too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get from any optician in a slightly smaller form as a gift. The cleaning effect is as good as that of a kitchen towel and no better. I expected a lot more from these towels, it's also really, really thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far exaggerated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker I received as a giveaway broke unfortunately. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I dropped it in the shower), plays bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come loose... it can play sound very loud... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As said, bass is rendered as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. While my old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, the frequencies were presented fairly naturally at volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to deduct a star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint also came off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both dressers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did everything for us and gave us the money back. Kudos to Amazon
Rather spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. Individual parts are supplied which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a plain envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I didn't fault it as I needed this product badly. The supplied adhesive hardly sticks, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that everything does not stick together. The templates are partially punched out incomplete. Okay for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and get a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, although the instructions aren't that clear. + Magnetic clasps + Nice look + Stable when assembled + Shelf board can be positioned anywhere
- Doors slam through magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- the dowels supplied are much too small and wobble (didn't have any other ones and since there wasn't a trophy in the house, they were glued on with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and compensated) Conclusion: if it doesn't would look so good and have such good measurements I would give less stars as you have to make everything fit to be really happy. Also, I think it's a bit overpriced for that.
I like the coffee...but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packed, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
I'm getting on my nerves
The alarm came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural noises sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I fell out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned to face the alarm clock, thinking it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also found it good that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. But returned for the reasons stated.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these bulbs. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board smiles at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have sorted it out quickly and accommodatingly, but I only found that out after the return deadline. So I see it as my fault and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for the hallway, study, workroom, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I would personally use warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and I may also get intact specimens there according to the order. If my rating is of any help, I would be happy to receive a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. yes positive I thought long and hard about ordering this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle for hanging ** The soft silicone won't scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially handy to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440℉. **They also do not transmit heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it
B-Ware sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the water tap and checked all the parts. Here we found that the part had already been installed. We noticed significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The hose fittings/connectors were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratches / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably been shipped and returned before. We keep this faucet and put it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we can get decent goods. Just find it sad that customers are so fooled!!!
The product itself is great, but unfortunately the outdoor sensor broke after just 6 months
In principle I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy and the radio range is also very good, with no problems with transmission from the inside to the outside. I also like the design of the device. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity are always displayed. That's a shame, since the device was attached to a protected spot on the outside and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with a weak grass collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery as of today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and the result is a nice sectional view. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a big shortcoming. For one thing, it's only hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down for just a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. Worse, however, is that the level indicator, which is actually practical, shows red when the grass catcher is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket when it is only half full on a large lawn cannot be the solution. So I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for surveillance
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only shown once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery power. I only give 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again with great difficulty. - One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately I haven't managed to level the hotbed properly yet. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw falls out, as it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars holding the cart are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what to do there, because it's impossible to print something like that. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to re-lay them several times, which is very tiring. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't gotten an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. I was expecting a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be found. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
Bought the bracelet and haven't worn it for the time being because it has a disgusting smell. This smell hasn't gone away to this day, even though it's been "ventilated" all the time. After it was no longer possible to return it, I threw it away. Discontinue purchase
OK for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so that it looks quite massive. The larger balls can be moved freely, which I find really nice. However, the chain is processed very simply overall, so that I have already torn open the clasp twice. So far I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will last long. But you can't really expect anything of high quality for the low price.
Very nice piece of jewellery
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't unravel, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that the goods were used. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some gimmicking.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and put it back in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three channels was also very different! All in all, useless for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against buying it, it will only bring trouble!
transport damage
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft rusted after 3.5 years. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections for the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a manufacturing defect and that the current pump will serve a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump was damaged in transit, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
Could have thought better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws had to be tightened again and again. It's nice that you can do that with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that didn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now for the most annoying part: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths thanks to the different parts, but once you've screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to get the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the third time I installed it, the screw in the thread broke off, making the whole thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all, you only need all the necessary keys once and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Doesn't quite match the dimensions given
Smooth-running zippers, the material seems robust and all of it featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, for example for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the case - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags. Not of high quality, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now when I wanted to use it again, it wouldn't. Battery? exchanged. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money straight into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked the fact that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
nice dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Value for money is right here, especially since I also bought it on a lightning sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so low and the sleeves could do with a little more fabric (unless your upper arms are as narrow as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously didn't expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at most. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 1990s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will work, or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a vile extension I certainly wouldn't have bought this bulky lump with gold connectors. But apart from the optics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is limited :-).
Small but great! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it's also safe and has contact from there... All in all, a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and made stable in one aluminum piece. Price-performance fits.
Loads of power
Top device. Has been running for months with no problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it performs well. I think the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) is a bit too cool and I am therefore always on level 2. Has fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a good impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can recommend them unreservedly.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, which is not disturbing. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He currently lasts about 1.5 hours a day. A solution that would take 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, the battery would not have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. One should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
Garbage after a few weeks
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too. However, the lifespan decreases more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole broke after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair also didn't last very long in normal use, but I figured it would do for class. Unfortunately, it was not like that. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance there doesn't seem to be any difference either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely won't last five years like my previous ones. I am excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance that I was lucky. The scope of delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope it doesn't appear again. A lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It's easy to lie on and goes great with the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but it is pure luxury for days at the event. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Before that, we removed the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). As my friend is handy, he was able to fix it and put it back together the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall I am very pleased with the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope it doesn't lose any air and lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test I can definitely recommend it. If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open over several doors right on day 1 due to the silly processing. On the 21st door, there were no more doors on it and I more or less had to mine my Son allow him to take out the rest of the parts as well since they came falling towards him.The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to take the car apart again to put the parts on.After the car is completely put back together parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the front screen. This is also very difficult to put back on.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they design the calendar have for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I'm excited about the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies it. Indoors, it flies very well and the 5-minute flight time is usually quite sufficient. I didn’t expect hair to get caught in it and the drone to break very quickly given the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. Contact us if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Didn't see when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD, just a code to download the game. That's fine so far, but you're forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is rude. Since then the computer hangs up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails because of the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The service worked well... and yet I send it back. The big snags are the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just left on the cupboard overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already dead by noon / early afternoon and then you can no longer even read the time. Therefore not useful for me. Too bad.
Noble cover with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I recently liked cases that you can also put your credit card in. This is what the case offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid will be a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and appears to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only the connections have cut-outs. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. It doesn't even work on the QI leather charging station from TORRO. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be opened easily. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall a good buy.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells across the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism could trigger SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like reaction.
Autologous blood sampling prior to elective surgical interventions helps to reduce the perioperative risk, but can itself cause side effects.
Are there special patient characteristics that influence the frequency and severity of adverse events?
Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initially systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease only begins in adulthood, and it is then referred to as Still's disease with onset in adulthood ("adult onset Still's disease").
The diagnostic criteria include a characteristic rash, joint symptoms, fever attacks and leukocytosis as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlarged lymph nodes or spleen and missing titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who had been ill for a long time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The exanthema of Still's disease is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply demarcated macules that are very fleeting.
Slight friction can trigger erythematous Koebner phenomena in the exanthema flare, which, as we are describing here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthema.

The assessment of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria are required for the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma or a melanocytic nevus that is a differential diagnosis.
In the case of malignant melanoma, the prognostically relevant tumor parameters that are important for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and uniformly in the histopathological report.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnostics in malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children pose a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Infections with a large number of pathogens are possible causative factors, in the foreground, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens, are Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegalovirus (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses.
In 25-30% of cases, however, the respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
Anamnesis, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often of little help in making the diagnosis.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
The flexible bronchoscopy with the implementation of a bronchoalveolar lavage results in a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%, the remaining cases must - with the corresponding clinical signs - be diagnosed by a mostly open lung biopsy.
Younger to middle-aged women are predominantly affected.

We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical picture of IMDE (type I).

Using the pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to examine the efficiency of direct reduction of stenosing trailing edge fragments performed under intraoperative sonographic control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction in ASP:
The spinal canal is wider below L1 than between Th11 and L1 and thus tolerates a greater narrowing.
In the case of fractures without neurological deficits, fragment reduction promises to avoid late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there are indications of ultrasound analgesia depending on the prescribed power density (LD) in patients with non-radicular back pain with serial application.
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated mandibular fractures that are difficult to reduce have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly displaced fractures in the distal part of the mandible can also be treated successfully using monocortical mini-plate osteosynthesis.
The collection of preoperative and intraoperative parameters that describe the character of a mandibular fracture and add up to a rank value for the classification of a trauma seems to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between both therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - such as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations to describe a mandibular trauma that all studies conducted to date with their small number of cases can at best allow a rough differential indication.
As long as there is no prospective multicenter study available that could help in the choice of the osteosynthesis method, preference should be given to the functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid area between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representations of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, software was developed that enables the location and type of changes to be recorded objectively.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH cumulative karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of cumulative karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures created from a patient's tomography data.
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance with the intraoperative implementation of what was previously planned and with spatial orientation in the surgical site.
After the successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the miniaturization of laboratory analyzes are increasingly leading to renewed decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is carried out close to the patient outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample volumes.
While these benefits are often emphasized, they are not accompanied by a clear clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analytical devices by untrained ward staff, insufficient or no calibration and/or quality control, costs due to the provision of multiple devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between the POCT results and the routine laboratory results, are also evident.
In the authors' opinion, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure that the analyzes are meaningful and of a high quality.
Taking into account the local situation (24-hour central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes should be:
Hemoglobin or Hematocrit, Activated Whole Blood Clotting Time, Blood Gases, Sodium, Potassium, Ionized Calcium, Glucose, Ammonia and Lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures using MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects are prerequisites.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents, and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still in its infancy.
It is possible that MR tomography can gain considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Characteristic skeletal changes occur in patients with chronic renal failure.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the changes in bone mass of the spine from C2 - L5 during long-term hemodialysis.
Spinal columns were completely examined from 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years.
With a newly developed preparation technique, a combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed immediately in addition to the histological image.
Vertebral body height (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular connection (TBPf) were quantitatively evaluated.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution over the spine known from the skeletal healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve progressing from the cervical to the lumbar spine is 5% lower for the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with longer hemodialysis show higher BV/TV values independent of age and sex.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological cross-linking of the cancellous bone and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP compared to the controls reveals a much greater restructuring of the architecture than can be deduced from the 2-D slice planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré first described a form of inguinal hernia that did not correspond to what was previously known due to the course of the disease and the autopsy findings made by Littré himself.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall rupture in a scientific paper on "Fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
The historical processing of this type of hernia is based on a case report.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the decades that followed.
It was not until the 1980s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disruption is unclear.
A patient is presented with the typical features of Asperger's syndrome, who also had epilepsy and internal abnormalities.
Possible comorbidities of Asperger's Syndrome, such as epilepsy, are discussed along with the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic approach.
Yersinia infections usually manifest in childhood as febrile gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
A child is reported in whom Yersinia infection manifested as long-lasting tumorous lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root.
The diagnosis was made by repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer Yersinia membrane proteins.
All clinical findings normalized only after therapy with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated in 23 prehospital resuscitation cases.
Questions were investigated as to which conclusions the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation allow and which consequences result from these findings.
The investigation shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
A wealth of scientific data was presented at this workshop, which revealed the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy, followed later by septic shock.
In addition, Staphylococcus epidermidis was detected in this autologous blood reserve, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned goods was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous hemotherapy also harbors a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and that the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an uncommon manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.
We describe a term neonate with VACTERL association who, following candida sepsis, developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis resulting in hydronephrosis with onset of postrenal renal failure.
Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine and direct lavage with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy normalized the excretory function.
With increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, the possibility of bezoar formation should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to be able to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method of treating acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy, or respond only insufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the following parameters:
Skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, peripheral blood eosinophils.
On the other hand, it was found that the non-responders had a significantly increased atopy score and increased titers of total IgE and specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, a high bacterial colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestine with Candida albicans was found comparatively more frequently in the non-responders.
These findings indicate that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopy syndrome and on the other hand by complicating superinfections.
The latter finding suggests that these patients may benefit from combining high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
The association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is shown on the basis of two typical case studies.
Clinically, there are subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates, which can lead to ulcerations and scarring retractions.
Histologically there is a lobular panniculitis.
A positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components on the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels is also considered a further diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology are of particular importance, since deep lupus erythematosus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has existed for more than 45 years.
The patient died with clinical signs of a cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of a vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy, which was confirmed by autopsy and by toxicological analyses.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of development of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapy methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
In this review, the results of experimental and clinical studies related to the development of optimal lead configurations and shock waveforms for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion are summarized.
As a result of scientific advances in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, who are old, with a restricted cardiac pump function, who have had previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires risk stratification, with which the surgical risk can be divided into "low", "medium" and "high".
A distinction can be made between preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patient, structural and treatment-related factors.
On the basis of this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra- and postoperative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary organized management.
The patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucous membrane tumors, especially spinalioma and basalioma.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, one spinalioma, and one lymph node metastasis from a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complementation analysis, which resulted in an allocation to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies on the breast, thoracic wall and/or abdominal wall that have not been treated for years and have in the meantime developed ulcers present the plastic surgeon with the need to cover large defects after tumor resection has been carried out.
By using silver-containing activated carbon fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer pads (Allevyn), infection could be avoided after flank replacement with an omentumplasty in the context of the resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable trunk wall even without the use of plastic mesh.
The health care reform of 2000 in Germany changes little in the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The monopolies of the hospitals for inpatient care and the registered contract doctors for outpatient care are not touched.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be specified for outpatient operations that may not be performed on an inpatient basis.
The quality assurance obligation is specified and tightened.
A new DRG-based price system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure represents a complex immunological process which is affected by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, is system-wide and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces synthesis of mRNA encoding many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8 and the inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli induce parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, inhibiting activation of NF-B and minimizing the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control cellular immunoreactivity, both locally and systemically.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may ultimately help to better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are mostly non-specific.
X-rays are often only brightening in the bone, sometimes isolated or diffuse radiopacities.
Root tip resorptions can be another important finding.
After a short historical outline, based on the currently valid WHO classification, a brief report is given on the current state of knowledge for each individual type.
The therapy concept that is valid today is then developed from this, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
Malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
Generalized cheerfulness disorder (GHDS) is a mental illness that is often recognized late and is characterized by a uniformity of mental experience in the face of circumstances that normally prompt depressed mood, despair, great anxiety, self-blame, or aggression directed toward others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of those affected and prevent long-term adverse individual and social consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis and immediate therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapy regimen that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of the inflammation is able to minimize subsequent neurological damage and save the patient's life.
In this article, the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy is presented with special consideration of molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/denta scan) is the method of choice for the radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly useful in delineating bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
Using this technique allows for accurate characterization of pathologies including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
Without knowing the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), a causal treatment is currently not possible.
Most of the currently available studies on oral IC therapy were neither randomized, double-blind nor placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, there is therefore no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign lesions and clinically resemble Darier follicular dyskeratosis, seborrheic keratoses, or planar warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective cornification.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be differentiated from severe congenital keratinization disorders that show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic substances are often used in cardiac anesthesia in interventions with extracorporeal circulation (EKZ).
However, at the same time there are concerns about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
In this study, therefore, the effectiveness of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during heart surgery under ECC should be compared.
The imaging diagnostics of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
Involvement of the manubriosteran joint (sternal synchondrosis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
Between January 1994 and June 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy at the University Eye Clinic in Leipzig because of endophthalmitis.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the "Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study".
In this retrospective work, the functional results of the surgical treatment should be examined.
In his childhood, Heinrich Heine experienced an episode of a pseudologia phantastica.
The causative factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this work.
The effectiveness and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis and the therapeutic effect as a function of the HLA B27 feature are to be tested.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms since the age of 14 is presented.
It is not an independent obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
During therapy with clozapine for the schizophrenic symptoms, which became exacerbated in the 31st year of life, neither psychotic symptoms nor any noteworthy obsessive-compulsive symptoms were found in the one-year follow-up.
While the literature increasingly points to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, here - as far as the author is aware - the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved by clozapine in schizophrenia is described.
The importance of the differential diagnosis of the compulsive phenomena for an adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of the individual case.
A disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli is referred to as an isomorphic irritation effect (Koebner phenomenon).
The induction of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing with intensities above 0.055 J/cm2 is reported.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis foci developed in the viral efflorescences after a varicella infection.
Since the person concerned was planning to stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed anamnesis, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was made to rule out an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to ask about genetic risk factors for developing one, and to ask whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a reaction to vaccination;
First experiences and results are reported with 13 one-stage reconstructions of large complex head and neck defects with 8 microvascular anastomoses forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major island flaps.
There was no complete flap loss in any case.
Better functional and esthetic results were obtained with the free forearm graft, but the operative times required for the reconstruction were relatively long.
The main disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are poor modeling and a limited radius of rotation.
It was used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically leads to an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While up to now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has primarily been regarded as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there have recently been indications that exogenous factors can put endothelial cells into a state ready for inflammation even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in the metal ion concentration or the oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are not only subject to the control of tissue-specific mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, represent an indication for the local administration of rTPA.
We report our results.
A case of a benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node, which was first described 5 years ago and has not yet been documented in German-language literature, is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of myofibroblastic cells (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) arranged in sections in a palisade-like manner, their diagnostic criteria include haemorrhage zones accentuated towards the periphery and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
The increased strength of 2 parallel inner splints reduced obstruction and kinking and reversed congestion in the proximal lumen system.
In addition to the flow of urine within the splints, this technique also enables an increased flow between the splints, which is regarded as a decisive mechanism for the passage of urine in the case of lying ureteral splints.
In cases of extrinsic compression of the ureter, in which the insertion of a single inner splint cannot adequately reverse the ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral inner double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapeutic alternative in be considered, which may save some patients the need for a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive procedures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis) available for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations, the intradiscal application of chymopapain represents the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables an efficient, low-risk, minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
In a prospective study, the value of diuretic sonography in comparison to the diuretic senephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorders should be examined.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic method in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.
The method has been further developed and modified over the past 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three methods have the same goal:
Radical removal of the tumor while protecting the non-affected surrounding tissue.
However, they differ significantly with regard to the technique of tumor excision, the attachment of the histological sections and the histological evaluation of the specimen.
A methodical inventory is made and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The "Marjolin Ulcus" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior compared to other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with a lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after a correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedicled radial artery flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with the epidural application of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is presented, also in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient-controlled analgesia").
The intrathecal mode of application is said to have various advantages over the epidural mode.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It seems that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
With regard to the quality of the analgesia, the serious side effects, the amount of the administered opioid or the postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of a thoracic over a lumbar injection.
There are indications that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with a high preoperative risk and is also cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized patch tests at the centers involved are recorded centrally in Germany.
For the present study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of Peru and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists for defined patient groups (according to sex, age, eczema localization, geographic region, occupation, sensitization) and special questions were also drawn up.
In percentage terms, the positive reactions for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of Peru were significantly less in men than in women.
Younger patients reacted more frequently to thiomersal, older to external medicines.
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found to an increased extent in hand eczema.
Higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens were found in people allergic to nickel and mixed fragrances compared to the total population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not recognizable.
Differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve quality in the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
About 95% of all people who are infected (have come into contact) with M. leprae do not develop the disease openly.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
In this review article, current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy are considered.
Recently, a large number of studies on the quantitative investigation of the Tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (HF) using laser tyndallometry have been presented.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison to the Tyndall intensity in the KW in uveitis of different localization, it should be investigated to what extent the increase in Tyndall is actually caused by a BKS disorder.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units that are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal experimental test results do not stand up to clinical examination, since in animal experiments inferior regeneration performance can occur despite an impeded regeneration path.
Morbidity from acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term effects is the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections and one third developed cervical dysplasia.
A quarter developed chronic symptoms and long-term effects of ascending genital infections.
Although the increased incidence of cervical carcinoma (up to 5%) was included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhoea (17%) or hypermenorrhoea were increasingly observed.
Premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, preterm birth are the main complications of pregnancy.
Maternal HIV infection progression through pregnancy was not observed.
Risks for peripartum transmission of infection to the fetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with delivery such as prematurity, preterm labor, amniotic infection, duration of membrane rupture and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of an increased maternofetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be mitigated by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low-contamination caesarean section delivery (4-6%) and most successfully by primary caesarean section and simultaneous prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%) avoid.
Dendritic cells play a central role in the initialization of the immune response because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
First clinical studies on patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized in vitro with tumor antigen can be used successfully in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in the tumor tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinoma of the The supraglottis and the glottis were examined immunohistologically.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, are primarily detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with the clinical parameters, the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) showed the shortest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This indicates that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma represents a favorable prognostic factor for the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered to be an essential factor in the increased incidence of arteriosclerosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
In the present study, not only homocysteine but also the metabolites of its two degradation pathways, transulfurization (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were determined in patients with renal insufficiency.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the medical history and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to get an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in a university polyclinic or a dermatologist's practice in the years 1984-94 was carried out using patient files and partly also through follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean disease duration 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of the patients had atopy, 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were only positive in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, mostly with only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracycline 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), 13 patients had a complete remission and 8 had a remission improvement achieved.
A spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) over a follow-up period of 6.5 years.
The surprisingly good treatment successes using antibiotic therapy underline the need for further elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old patient who presented primarily with low back pain is reported.
The laboratory, radiological and histopathological findings primarily indicated the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, a dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
The histological picture of a non-specific inflammation was found in the repeatedly obtained sample excisions.
A highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could only be histologically demonstrated during the biopsy performed during the implant removal.
Chemotherapy was carried out according to the CHOP scheme and radiation therapy was given.
Lymphomas of the spine should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially if they are progressive.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or frontobase fractures in over 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures run through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa in up to 70% of cases.
There are different concepts for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
Between 1990 and 1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoid orbital fractures were treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without involvement of the skull base, reduction and treatment were performed using a subcranial approach.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extracranial and transcranial treatment of fractures of the ethmoid bone involving the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
however, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intraoperatively and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V. a. Phlebothrombosis should be treated surgically for a femoral neck fracture.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and cardiac arrest.
Resuscitation measures with cardiac massage and intravenous application of adrenaline and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under conditions of resuscitation, the intervention was ended with a provisional wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
At V. a. fulminant pulmonary embolism, a systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was carried out with continued cardiac massage.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the beginning of the lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics could be achieved with continuous, highest doses of catecholamines and volume substitution.
A massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis "pulmonary embolism" was made on the basis of the clinic, the capnometry, the blood gas analysis and the ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, no further diagnostic procedures were carried out.
During anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount administered is metabolised.
The magnitude of the resulting peak serum levels of inorganic fluoride are primarily determined by the rate of hepatic defluoridation, the total amount of anesthetic administered and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood gas partition coefficient.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in animal experiments, nor in clinical routine use or with protracted anesthesia duration, nor when used in patients with renal insufficiency, was an increased renal risk potential for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane demonstrated.
The recently demonstrated low level of intrarenal metabolization of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol/l used in the literature was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those found following anesthesia with sevoflurane, can therefore be classified as clinically harmless.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease.
The best results are obtained by laminating the cardiac ventricles parallel to the base after the fixation and laminating the coronary arteries, which may have been additionally decalcified, transversely, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can precede it.
With this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference and transmural extent of infarcts, their age and subsequent conditions can be better recorded and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than with the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood flow.
In the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed just as intact as the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in acute cardiac death and only briefly survived territorial ischemia.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be detected in correlation to the coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
However, more recent prospective randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection does not bring any additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus as well as for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, the esophagogastric junction and the stomach are not conclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, no convincing prognosis gain could be shown in several phase III studies through preoperative radiation, chemotherapy or combined radio-/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach can only be expected if the patient responds to the previous treatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio-/chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out in the context of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual for children, is usually only associated with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or "hysterical" symptom formation can be understood as processing of traumatic childhood and youth experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Memories of trauma that cannot be assimilated have a retraumatizing effect and must be warded off, for example through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior or social "acting".
Against this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements the experiences of hypnotherapy and katathymic-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact to inner helpers is created in the imagination in a resource-oriented manner.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stable confrontation, but as little as possible re-traumatizing introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner consolation and leaving oneself behind.
In the final phase, it is again about the resource-oriented approach to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the past 20 years with regard to diagnoses and the proportion of people with multiple disabilities.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor cerebri"), a venous outflow obstruction is a possible cause.
It was investigated to what extent visual acuity remains stable in the long-term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy and which causes and risk factors for deterioration of visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by most disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the portal of entry.
After inoculation, HIV replication can start within 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can be used to detect the budding HIV infection within four to twelve weeks; the antibody response is weakened under therapy;
with nucleic acid tests, detection succeeds from about the eleventh day.
In almost 100 years of development, countless endogenous, exogenous and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central third of the patellar tendon, a quadruple tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis), and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical importance.
With some limitations, the use of cadaveric transplants is also justified.
The individual transplants have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the transplants mentioned could not be verified.
When selecting a transplant, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account.
When treating complex ligament injuries and in cases of revision, careful, preoperative planning with, if necessary, a modified choice of transplant is necessary.
The rare course of development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
In the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed twice in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological work-up showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological features are discussed with reference to the literature.
Coronary calcium is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very precisely with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance differs depending on whether calcium screening is performed in patients with known coronary artery disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically important aspect of coronary artery disease.
In this work, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects with regard to ergometry are presented, as well as information on prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice.
We report on 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred in the context of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we observed no case of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
In patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, other diseases from the type II autoimmune polyendocrinopathy should therefore be ruled out.
Securing the airway after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
Care must therefore be taken to ensure safe reintubation if necessary.
Two patients are reported who, because of a recurring papillary thyroid carcinoma or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma, had significant intubation difficulties and thus high risk factors for intubation and, if necessary, reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiber optic placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- and preoperative reintubation aid.
Both the CT and the MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor spread pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for staging and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive studies for detecting neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis, and cartilage.
With both methods, however, the specificity is not as high as initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate the extent of the tumor.
The very high negative predictive value of the two cross-sectional imaging methods is important from a clinical point of view, since it makes it possible to rule out neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable information on a possible etiology, the extent of submucosal growth, and the appropriate biopsy site.
Cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implantation reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with terminal renal failure show an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.
There are only a small number of cases of myocardial revascularization using PTCA in patients with chronic dialysis, which suggest a high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We examined the restenosis rate in 23 patients with end-stage renal disease (17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primarily successful PTCA, coronary angiography was performed in all patients within 6-12 months.
Before angiographic control, 12 patients complained about the recurrence of anginal symptoms.
Laboratory tests showed that the patients had hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in the fibrinogen concentration ( 481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old woman is described, in whom complete instability of the pelvis developed within a year as a result of increasing stress fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.
A minor trauma to the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed to be the triggering event.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignant event was the main focus when making the differential diagnosis.
A wide range of different clinical pictures can be considered as the cause of hip pain in childhood.
The non-traumatic causes are included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, anamnesis, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed in order to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Some common, but also rarer clinical pictures are demonstrated by exemplary examples.
The iatrogenic termination of the greater trochanter in the prosthetic treatment of a femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "posterior approach" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated traumatic trochanteric detachment used here for comparison, even in the case of significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still discussed controversially.
The present work presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
Based on the ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment results, further patient utilization behavior and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
This shows that the connection between treatment results and satisfaction is not particularly large.
Dissatisfied and satisfied patients differ in further utilization behavior.
The connection between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are very large in relative terms, but in absolute terms these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in male aging resemble changes in younger, hypogonadal males.
Although testosterone levels fall on average with age, correlations between middle-aged and older symptoms and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to the methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone values with age, unclear reference values for older men and a variety of influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone values.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea that had existed for five days underwent sonography before the planned lysis therapy after nuclear medicine indicated a stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
A right atrial, floating thrombus was found.
If there was an acute threat to life, an ultra-high-dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the leg thrombosis had largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with a mean age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
A single fracture was identified in 50% of the patients, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or multiple trauma.
The average length of hospitalization was 17 days and the average use of crutches was 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid healing process.
In the majority (85%) the treatment was without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) of patients with open fractures and in only 2 (0.4%) of patients with closed fractures, which is within usual norms.
Based on our results and experience, we are of the opinion that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics in head and neck cancer is still a matter of controversy.
In the present retrospective study, the course of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract was used to examine which factors influence the frequency and localization of distant metastases.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastases correlated positively with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001) and with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a second tumor outside the ENT area (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumor location' and 'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, had no independent predictive value, but essentially reflected different frequencies of the tumor stages.
At the time of the initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in tumors of the categories T1-3 N0 can be limited to a chest x-ray.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumors, for recurrences and for secondary tumors outside the ENT area.
However, one should always ask oneself the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article provides a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the late 19th century to the present day.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small group of early psychoanalysts who, with great enthusiasm and "productive orthodoxy", strove for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and of the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in Germany in 1927.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of the most diverse historical divisions in professional societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "Psychotherapeutic Medicine".
Nevertheless, emphasizing Simmel should not mean that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish descent are no longer duly remembered.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, non-unions, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computer tomographic/sonographic analysis of the leg geometry is of central importance.
With the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was the meta-analysis of all available randomized, controlled studies in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur as part of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term with systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to one-sided compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs on the compression side in more than 80% of cases, a causal connection can be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the event of a herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for malignant changes in the area of the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and associated with high perioperative morbidity and mortality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be carried out in the patient in a blood-saving manner and with almost no complications.
With a median follow-up time of 3 years, 6 of 7 patients were symptom-free. In one patient who underwent surgery for a gastrinoma, increased gastrin levels were found late postoperatively.
Compared to the preoperative function test, it was shown that the endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly impaired by the operation.
If the indication is strict, benign tumors in the area of the pancreas head can be treated adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications and without permanent restriction of the exocrine and endocrine functions by means of a duodenum-preserving pancreas head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardia cardiac arrhythmias.
Approximately every sixth patient dies of sudden cardiac death in the period following pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly attributable to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart can harbor the risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.
Especially with advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and sensory defects, eg during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable, but above all even safer to do for the patient.
Staging, ie determining the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with a curative objective, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are treated with alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy). become.
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including the liver and adrenal glands), sonography of the upper abdomen, and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial carcinoma.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to CT for specific questions, eg after chest wall infiltration, and for patients with a contrast agent allergy.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) positron emission tomography for assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111-octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and Thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical value is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also being used more and more frequently for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor receptors, could play an important role in the staging of bronchial carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdomen, the retroperitoneum and the small pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs can occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, the prevention of such side effects in tumor therapy is of particular importance.
Impaired erection or ejaculation disorders can occur after surgical, radiotherapeutic or drug therapy of various tumors.
With a thorough understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, a high percentage of these disorders are now preventable.
If damage to the corresponding nerve tracts cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunctions are a significant reduction in the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated in almost all cases using a number of therapy modalities.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the neck vessels at different cannulation locations.
It is reported about a truck driver after crush trauma to both legs, who developed an atypical hepar-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under drug thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
In addition to a thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with positive antibody detection against heparin:
At our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also split surgically on the left lower leg.
After excluding possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) could be detected 2 days later.
Immediately after rinsing an intravenous access with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction, which could be stopped immediately by cortisone administration.
We postulate that the thrombocytopenia otherwise considered characteristic of HIT is only one of the possible forms of the allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of the thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of the thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal for a new classification of the different forms of heparin allergy type I-IV is made.
Types I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without platelet drop and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
In 1991, basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the second edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) "Histological Typing of Salivary Gland Tumors".
The first description goes back to Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
Eq. parotis is the site of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are only described as casuistries;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
Therapy consists of surgical tumor extirpation with a sufficient safety margin and histologically controllable tumor freedom of all resection margins.
According to current knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma has a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal experimental model of kidney xenotransplantation was developed, in which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs into Wistar rats as recipient animals, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta or vena cava and ureteral drainage by splinting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on kidney xenografts.
A total of 24 xenotransplantations were performed and treated randomly with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
A significant reduction in complement activity in the sCR1 group was found serologically, which can be attributed to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, the control group showed masses of thrombocyte aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates histologically.
In contrast, the kidney transplants treated with sCR1 showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and less interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study revealed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the therapy group.
To date, 52 laparoscopic interventions on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and hernia have been performed in our facility using the robotic arm for optical guidance, which is controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is determined directly by commands from the operator.
In all interventions, the control of the robotic arm was precise, the speech recognition accurate and without any technical problems.
29 interventions could be carried out by one surgeon alone as "solo surgery".
In a further 20 interventions, only one assistant was employed in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications using DSA in kidney and pancreas transplants requires an invasive intervention in vessels that have mostly been damaged by diabetes, and the use of iodinated contrast media can have nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated using a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation with the trauma surgery department and the medical department of the Minden Clinic.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy of operative endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapy result and a discussion of the literature, the procedure presented is successful, both in terms of local sanitation of the infection and the functional result.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods to safely and effectively treat these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intense investigation.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor disruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They appear as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
Case studies report on the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus as a result of a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation.
Type I diabetes mellitus is one of the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patients of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the pediatric clinic of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction is reported after the use of absorbable interference screws for the fixation of a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgery, which led to a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Primary plasmacytomas of the kidneys are extremely rare.
To date, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in whom an operated kidney tumor proved histologically to be a plasmacytoma.
Based on this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with kidney involvement, nephrectomy is only indicated for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary kidney involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
In the course of a multicentre, prospective, clinical study from 17 German hospitals, a treatment indication corresponding to the type of fracture or a suitable therapy method was selected for 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by establishing a practice-related score.
Numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases that follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines are known to date.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired striated, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without a previous inflammatory stage and without subsequent sclerotherapy or other anomalies.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be carried out safely as home training.
In group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge of anatomy, the development of arthrosis and knee-friendly and relieving behavior are conveyed.
The efficiency of "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was proven in a prospective, randomized study.
Correct orientation and size of the implants is of paramount importance for a successful and durable total knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are shown.
As part of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has proven to be suitable for separating confirmed patients from confirmed controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital primary care of 274 acutely injured (58%) or ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 was examined with regard to the timing of the operations, compliance with the assistance deadline, age and gender distribution , the degree of severity, the causes of trauma and injury patterns, the type of acute pediatric illness, the pre-hospital emergency diagnostics and therapy as well as the means of transport and the destination hospital based on the emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the orthopedic university clinic in Mainz has been examining which clinical pictures can be treated with low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with increasing age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations for diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and sex-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow were analyzed in test persons in the present study.
Therapy control is currently not possible in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the condition after cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation.
For this reason, patients without an actual tendency to recurrence are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A mandatory prerequisite for P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must occur, and the P-wave must be filtered bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
A standardization of the method is urgently desired.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P-wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol, as a class III antiarrhythmic, does not affect P-wave duration, but spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In summary, after optimization of the method, signal averaging of the P wave allows identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
A prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is knowledge of the origin of pain.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are conducted via an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to chronic pain of this kind.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, coanalgesics and opioid analgesics are of particular importance in chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapy standards must be observed.
Blockades with local anesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations can be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockades are of particular importance in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate carcinoma is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In the case of T3/4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of the para-aortic lymphatic drainage tract compared to the sole irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies with outdated radiation technology.
Radiation therapy of the lymph drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate carcinoma is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be carried out as part of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
Due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, however, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively treated with a thin-calibre drainage.
In contrast, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated for a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinical features, eg in mechanical ventilation patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnostics.
A hemothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with a Bülau drainage and, if necessary, surgically treated because of the risk of severe blood loss.
A spontaneous hemothorax also requires drainage and internist clarification.
The doctor in an internal intensive care unit must be able to diagnose and treat pneumothorax and hemothorax.
The question of this prospective single case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology and radiology.
The mortality rate, the overall severity of the injuries, the probability of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, ie pelvic injuries with accompanying peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions is the focus of the interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabular fractures present a special challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation shows the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term result deteriorates.
The primary accidental cartilage damage seems to have a major impact on the long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
An isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused symptoms typical of aortic isthmus stenosis in a 56-year-old patient.
What is remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of the calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the chest suggested a differential diagnosis of a calcified aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection, or past aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of the photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of these receptor types in the RPE were investigated.
With reference to the change in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as proof of academic qualification has recently been questioned.
In the discourse on the use and development of reproductive technologies, the aspects of experience of those affected recede into the background.
Many people only ask for help outside of medical treatment when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is one of the most common sites for metastases in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy methods depends on the histology, the evidence of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
Hormone therapy is the therapy of first choice for receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast cancer, after hormone therapy has failed, or if liver metastases are detected.
Chemotherapy should always be carried out for small cell bronchial carcinomas.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastasizing non-small cell bronchial carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, systemic therapy is indicated with caution and is limited primarily to younger patients and patients in a sufficiently good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging a response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for determining bone breakdown products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve stretch pain should be investigated.
Subjectively, the risk of becoming infected with HIV at work is often considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure are vaccinations, there are z. B. a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In the case of injuries with material containing HBV, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-exposure.
There is no drug-based post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon when HCV RNA is detected appears to have a high success rate.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed in a 26-year-old woman from a lung biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years previously, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as an angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical investigations with actin antibodies showed strong positive reactions both in the muscular differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal brain with a diameter of up to 5 cm.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal, predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidneys, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international debate on questions of euthanasia as well as developments in Australia and Oregon indicate a growing tendency to give preference to assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Dutch Supreme Court on a psychiatrist's assisted suicide prompted us to examine this issue from a psychiatric perspective.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) were investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
A differentiated nitrine innervation of the prostatic glands, the stroma and the vessels could be demonstrated both by means of the NADPH diaphorase (d) reaction and by immunohistochemistry.
In the specimens with obstructive hyperplasia, there seems to be a pronounced reduction in nitrine innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out due to the small number of specimens.
In the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of NOS depending on the vascular section could also be demonstrated by means of the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemistry.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional blood flow and secretion in normal and hyperplastic prostates.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse causes of ileus, the indication for surgery and the choice of surgical procedure for small bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.
A uniform procedure for the intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of an intestinal splint) and the closure of the abdominal wall (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small bowel plication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with the Noble operation having been largely replaced by the Child-Phillips plication and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no reliable indications or contraindications for plications, long tubes or other surgical measures.
Given the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of small bowel ileus, changing this remains an important task for the future.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can increase their social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment and at the same time prevent misunderstandings.
Such an analysis is also a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the couples concerned.
Gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength in depressed individuals have often been described in the clinical literature, but have hardly been empirically investigated to date.
We assessed various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework essentially based on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressed persons were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyzes that record step length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed and 3-minute walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy test persons.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy could be demonstrated in knee and elbow extension and also in all gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the context of the present pilot study are suitable for the reliable and less stressful investigation of relationships between depression and motor functions and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can lead to an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or there can be chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely result in pressure regulation.
We report the results after cataract surgery for subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
The influence of autogenic training (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptides was investigated in 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS).
Compared to healthy controls (N), the scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/L, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/L).
The VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences to the normal values (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/L, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/L).
We describe 2 unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years, both showed progressive neurological deterioration, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex and storage phenomena in lymphocytes.
The -L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (<3% of the normal value).
So far, the mutation G401X has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who came to the hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased liquor protein were detected in the liquor.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this test, which is carried out routinely, strongly positive results for ketones were obtained in the autopsy of three persons who had clearly died as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without the glucose in the urine being increased at the same time.
Excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L were found in all three urine samples using headspace gas chromatography.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 with a normal glucose result in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study of 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide information for the therapeutic procedure.
The infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
An 8-year-old girl developed eruptive symmetrical papules and papulovesicles on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, while serology for hepatitis B virus was negative.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are primarily based on the anatomical position relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as luxation, subluxation and disc luxation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations have been described as a complication of a number of neurological disorders.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Port-wine stains can lead to considerable psychosocial stress.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, the quality of life and the body image of patients with port-wine stains and b) the effects of the pulsed dye laser therapy on the psychosocial parameters.
A psychological test on the areas of coping with the disease, quality of life and physical experience was carried out on 70 patients with port-wine stains as part of therapy with the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser.
The clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the port-wine stain during the course of therapy.
In terms of social anxiety, patients with port-wine stains showed a similarly high level of stress as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the birthmark.
With regard to helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients with port-wine stains were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and physical experience.
The experience of the body is influenced differently by the way the disease is coped with.
Since the brightening in the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stress, flash lamp pulsed dye laser therapy for port wine stains can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents an independent clinical picture since the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in finding and staging PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological presentations and a wide range of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and the therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had had a nevus sebaceus in the area of the right temple since birth.
The histopathological examination revealed 2 adnexal neoplasias associated with the lesion:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined appearance of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q waves, new left bundle branch block) and elevated values of the "classic heart enzymes" creatine kinase ( CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementia.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in an over 80-year-old patient.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia in the presence of hypothyroidism and dementia secondary to hypothyroidism, but rather the course of therapy.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, an aneurysm near the outlet of the left subclavian artery was successfully eliminated by implanting a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graft.
The follow-up over a year showed a very good long-term result with a freely perfused stent lumen and a completely eliminated aneurysm.
A control computed tomography revealed a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described as an independent entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.
Nevertheless, as early as the first half of the 19th century, there are illustrations in an atlas by Marie Nicolas Devergie that almost necessarily indicate pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains not only casuistries of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin, but also individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy customary at the time.
The rapidly expanding ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as a side effect of this excessive therapy with mercury, since they healed spontaneously after it was discontinued.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of pyoderma gangrenosum can be found more than 100 years before it was first named.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not yet been sufficiently clarified.
The theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangrenosum persisted in several publications well into the 1960s.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study addresses the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions after TIVA with remifentanil/propofol (P/R) is faster than after balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Uniform estradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment in order to achieve effective, but highly variable drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal troughs.
The high doses of estrogen when given orally are necessary because the passage through the liver leads to a pronounced metabolism of estrogen.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and psychomotor retardation, and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The aim of the present study was to measure the physical resilience of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-dependent changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions and tumors of the urinary bladder was to do better justice to the biology of the various lesions and to make a clearer distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinical practice in everyday life, taking current immunohistochemical findings into account, is viewed critically.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignancy, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to show relationships between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation in patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention in the sympathetic nervous system.
One speaks then of a sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causal pain), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and acute herpes zoster.
For people with chronic sleep and back problems, there is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality.
Routine diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes multiphasic abdominal spiral CT and chest X-ray.
Contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative if the spiral CT finding is unclear when it comes to intravenous tumor extension.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindications for non-ionic X-ray contrast media, patients in the stage of compensated renal insufficiency (not yet requiring dialysis) and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multiline) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common pediatric eye injuries are chemical burns, burns, lid trauma, corneal erosion, corneal foreign bodies, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, penetrating eye injury, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants/year.
They represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Known risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (<5 years), gender (male > female), and parental care.
The prognosis with regard to visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced not only by rapid and adequate therapy but also by psychosocial factors (compliance when using visual aids or masking the eyes to prevent amblyopia).
Deficits and imbalances in the muscles that stabilize the spine are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back problems.
Therefore, maintaining and restoring the full performance capability of the muscles that stabilize the spine must be a goal of prevention and rehabilitation, in addition to training coordinative skills and learning how to behave in a way that is appropriate for the spine.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including procedures on a neurophysiological basis, physical-balneological measures and supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
Various therapy goals are presented in their phase structure, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the course of rehabilitation.
Indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
Depending on the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, the therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation with physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The indication for surgery for slipped vertebrae is pain, progressive slippage and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity remains and in the case of spondyloptoses, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass with further progression of sliding can occur.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now also possible to reduce difficult sliding processes and restore a normal shape of the spine and trunk with an acceptable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at anatomical repositioning of the gliding vertebra.
Depending on the extent of slippage, reduction and stabilization should be performed in 1, 2, or 3 surgical steps.
A sole dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
Combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended for grade II and above.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this article, is to assess the effects of a geriatric psychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and advice for the elderly) on the process of change from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical-outpatient, mainly home-based) regional care structures demanded and extensively justified by the Federal Government's expert commission, for the first time towards an empirical examination undergo.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, a comparison of the care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ) reveals changes in the regional care substructures of geriatric psychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and Elderly care (subsystem C) analyzed.
With regard to subsystem A, the investigation shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intramural to extramural care, without selecting its clients according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the system of care for the elderly (subsystem C) is possibly expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh supply region the admission rate after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive restricted mobility in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to edema of the skin and fatty tissue, sonography and computer tomography also revealed extensive accumulations of fluid around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitium and - to a lesser extent - in the shoulder joint.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, the skin lesions healed quickly and mobility in the shoulder joint was restored over time.
In the case described, involvement of structures close to the joint in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated for the first time using modern imaging methods.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide enables breast-conserving treatment for larger tumors that are primarily unsuitable for breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be followed with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
Good reproducibility and availability speak in favor of mammography.
Tumors that cannot be delineated by mammography can usually be visualized by sonography.
In the MRI, the extent of the tumor is independent of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It also allows the acquisition of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopically small invasive and especially non-invasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even if the invasive tumor regresses and typically indicate intraductal, non-invasive tumor residues.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents itself clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the ICU.
This report uses the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, to discuss the treatment of pronounced GBS in the intensive care unit.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be able to create an emerging dissection immediately and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical therapy methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-pronged functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - Lesional as well as restorative and stimulative procedures are currently used in the clinic.
The previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and neurophysiological target localization.
The former technique is used to treat rigidity, hypokinesia, and drug-induced dyskinesia, while the latter method has proven effective in the treatment of tremor.
New sprouting of dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine release has only been documented in the transplantation of fetal cells;
however, the method raises ethical and immunological problems.
The high-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is stimulation of thalamic nuclei to treat tremor;
The animal experimental approach includes xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol-related disease, along with more common disorders such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal spasms, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic, side-emphasized, steep EEG potentials have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal seizures on the right side of the body with the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
The laboratory tests showed increased values for gamma GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI revealed microangiopathy and cerebral atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and triple anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and a deterioration in the general condition were still observed.
Several EEG examinations revealed periodic steep left parieto-occipital waves.
The patient died of pneumonia three months after the onset of symptoms.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of the SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinomas in childhood and adolescence without association with a basal cell nevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (86 cases in the world literature to date).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of the BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage in these patients are not yet available.
A 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical examination gave any indication of a genetic predisposition to the development of basal cellulitis.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on iliac crest biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in order to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Using the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes including their progenitor cells and the fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already observed in about 28% of the patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+-nucleated erythropoietic progenitor cells, which may be related to the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, hemoglobin synthesis, and the degradation of expelled normoblastic nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells could be detected in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrillation with clinical parameters such as the hemoglobin level, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in the peripheral blood and the size of the spleen could be calculated.
These variables apparently characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification into three different histological subgroups was made:
Corresponding hematological data were to be assigned to this simplified histological classification.
Sequential biopsies from 173 patients receiving IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) monotherapy revealed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN in contrast to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment were best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the associated time differences.
Thus, in patients with a complete haematological remission after IFN administration, the regeneration of erythropoiesis together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages including their activated subpopulation could be identified.
The histological subgroups revealed a transition from a (non-fibrillated) granulocytic as well as a megakaryocytic subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of the patients.
This phenomenon was in contrast to a numerical reduction of the myelofibrotic type mainly in patients receiving HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
In summary, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 consecutive patients admitted to a medical-geriatric unit were to be diagnosed with a naturalistic design in terms of mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination and the values in the mini mental state examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as not being able to be examined.
The remaining 74 patients were evaluated clinically and using screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Developments in dementia were, if necessary, verified or ruled out by neuropsychological tests.
Mental disorders of clinical significance (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found in 41 patients, and in more than half of them the disorder was relevant to the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
It remains open, however, how the therapy of the mental disorder, which is necessary according to this result for every 5th to 6th patient, can be guaranteed in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, particularly in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages because the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are the dependence on the examiner, the lack of standardization to date and the relatively high costs.
Therefore, the "Working Group for Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatism Center Berlin", which is made up of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has drawn up an overview of imaging diagnostics for sacroiliitis, in which technical details are given in addition to the clinical background and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Job's syndrome, Buckley's syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Significantly increased IgE concentrations in the serum with the simultaneous absence of indications of allergic and parasitic diseases are diagnostically indicative.
Treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be extremely well tolerated and effective.
More than a year after the one-off therapy, the symptoms have improved steadily.
The current state of knowledge and the available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, a therapy attempt with IVIG should be an option of first choice.
The present work presents the results after laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after the operation.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
Over 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo another antireflux operation if necessary.
Persistent side effects of the operation that did not impair the quality of life were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required renewed drug antireflux therapy.
A laparoscopic refundoplication was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease using laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplication can be documented and proven over the long term not only by objective findings, but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by measuring quality of life data.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are groundbreaking, proving the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycemia in the starvation test.
The standard operation is enucleation of the tumor or, depending on the size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appears to be superior to selective tumor removal.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable according to § 216 StGB;
From a medical point of view, too, it cannot be ethically justified.
This is not changed by the diverse tendencies to make "killing on demand" exempt from punishment under certain conditions, as in the Netherlands.
Nutrient proportions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally distinguished from immunologically active cells of the intestinal-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine becomes particularly clear in the seriously ill.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are important for the eutrophy of immune-competent intestinal cells, especially as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially fermented in the lower intestine to mainly produce the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
Among other things, these exert a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the non-food substances, it is primarily the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental well-being.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual assessments of situational influencing factors in nursing and stress-promoting factors in the nursing process.
The results show both large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their effects on physical and mental well-being.
Process fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis in acute and chronic ankle pain.
The early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term result.
Computed tomography (CT) is essential for a definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be taken.
Displaced fractures, when treated conservatively, lead to pain and restriction of movement and, in the long term, to arthritic remodeling of the subtalar joint, as reported in the literature and according to our own experience.
However, when it comes to the indication for a surgical procedure, the scarce literature shows that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to enable healing without consequences.
Comminuted fractures and small displaced fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be assessed due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unclear, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
An increase in dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in the serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to demonstrate activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in indolent mastocytosis in adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to popular belief, acute urticaria is rarely caused by IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies to food (73%) and more rarely chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-lasting remissions if the trigger is avoided (diet) or eliminated.
On the other hand, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly secondary and not disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a life-threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to show the variability of the possible injuries together with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which can usually only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are presented in the chronological sequence of polytrauma management and the differentiated options for care are pointed out.
Reports from previous working groups within the framework of multi-centre studies with only a small collective of patients show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus to define it as a standard. The currently valid guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to management together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly life-threatening patients.
The prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed in a retrospective study.
The postoperative course of 2 months to 35.2 years is known for 74 of these 78 patients (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found in higher T stages, and there were more synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In the statistical analysis, the e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/> 20%), a synchronous distant metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1) and the radicality of the intervention (R0/R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant.
Our data support the prognostic importance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a danger for adults due to the shift in the peak age.
The MMR combination vaccination is an effective method of preventing this disease and its consequences.
The 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and congenital rubella disease can be made a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and content aging in both middle and old age.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and agreeableness.
A regional comparison revealed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness as well as in subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region were found for openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement and physician judgment.
In more than 80% of cases, intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and mostly occur after abdominal surgery.
Anatomically, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral, and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Sonographically or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective procedure with few complications and a success rate of approx. 80% if the indication is defined.
Liver abscesses are mostly treated interventionally, while pancreatic, spleen and Crohn's abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities.
Since the mid to late 1980s, various research groups have been trying to improve the prediction of premature birth in the case of preterm birth through immunological diagnostics - in particular through the detection of cytokines.
A disadvantage, however, is that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been convincing from the amniotic fluid, ie by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high range of fluctuation of the individual biomediators.
Attempts were therefore made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
The detection of cytokines from the cervix of pregnant women using PCR technology may be a viable option for the future.
Internal fixator loading for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant loading changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured when sitting than when standing.
So there is little reason not to allow patients whose spine has been mono- or bi-segmentally stabilized to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
The additional ventral stabilization with bone chips often significantly changed the loading of the bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often significantly higher after ventral stabilization than before.
A corset or bodice did not reduce implant loading.
It is therefore not necessary to fit patients with a corset after mono- or bi-segmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adults.
The so-called atypical meningioma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to describe meningiomas with an increased tendency to recur compared to normal meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for the anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be subject to certain uncertainties.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined Ki-67 (MIB1) index related to the core area, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 grades (N=160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the "recurrence"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a poorly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large, prominent nucleoli.
Optionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, showed a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of the cases.
We were able to show histochemically that in meningiomas the tissue-unspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is located on 1p, can be used as a marker enzyme associated with progression and recurrence (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas ).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and can give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose the term meningiomas of the intermediate type for this group of tumors, which are located between the usual and the anaplastic meningiomas, and are relatively at risk of recurrence.
Due to the special anatomical situation, articular process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
Surgical treatment is indicated for severely displaced or dislocated fractures.
The preauricular, submandibular, perimandibular, retromandibular and oral approaches are established surgical approaches.
Only functionally stable methods such as the miniplate or lag screw should be used to fix the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT in comparison to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with Va focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing liquor Fowleri (Fowler's);
a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as an additional finding.
background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely inadequately represented in the basic health services established there.
To study the long-term impact of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system on the prevalence of skin diseases.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside of a single primary care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL enables a large selection of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of the wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasia, nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, to identify risk factors with regard to occurrence and to assess the benefit of early therapy for this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in the acute phase.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often difficult to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report on 2 cases of acute exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which could hardly be controlled even with the administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
In addition to the immunosuppression performed, both cases were treated with IgM-enriched, high-dose, intravenously administered immunoglobulins.
In both cases, the immunosuppressive drugs (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine), which were originally used in high doses, could be tapered down to minimal maintenance therapy.
After each 9 cycles of therapy, the patients remained symptom-free in the follow-up period of 1 year on minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurring abdominal pain, which is one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is primarily used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with a typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood's light has been used by adding fluorescent markers in the application control of topicals.
Endocardial mapping is possible if hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced as part of programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circuit excitation through stimulation maneuvers ("entrainment mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In the case of clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of the inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases by high-frequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is significantly lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a recurrence must be expected.
In the case of incessant ("incessant") ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardias is currently a complementary therapeutic procedure to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is to be expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively examined in 386 patients with rectal carcinoma in UICC stage I-III after conventional surgical interventions and R0 resection of the tumor .
In univariate analysis, we found a significant association between the number of dissected and involved lymph nodes, and concomitantly a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
In the total patient population and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of more precise tumor staging.
This points to the influence of other surgically influenced factors, in particular the total mesorectal excision for the development of a locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, uniform standards for the documentation of findings have so far been lacking.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the demands on quality assurance in echocardiography are satisfied.
Declining incidences of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
However, tuberculosis remains the most common fatal infectious disease worldwide.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration, increasing poverty and the increase in immunocompromised patients, particularly as a result of the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests in the skin and mucosa.
Eye involvement occurs in about 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been recognized in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has been previously described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
As with other diseases, endocarditis is known to have an asymptomatic course (18, 19, 20, 21), but clinically asymptomatic abscess formation has not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since it was first described is increasingly affecting areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is enough knowledge that IL-7 appears to be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in combating melanoma.
The authors are currently initiating a first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to be able to significantly influence the presence and growth of normal T cells and lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
In this overview, molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as prospects for possible uses of IL-7 in dermatology are outlined.
It was investigated whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
This thesis wants to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research streams relevant to everyday competence are outlined in the first part:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlocks aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental investigations and randomized clinical studies show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment could therefore potentially lead to major advances in radiation oncology.
The possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed in a brief overview.
Inhibiting the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during radiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only currently secured method is to carry out radiotherapy in the shortest possible overall treatment time, e.g. B. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned interruptions in treatment.
The acute inflammatory reaction probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and assessment of the prognosis of the acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour after admission and at intervals of 4-24 hours with regard to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or recurrent acute coronary syndrome.Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with CRP positive and TnT 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression with regard to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24 h), age, gender and diagnosis showed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1 µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of AMI were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24h course.Conclusions:
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are not very helpful for acute infarction diagnostics.
However, the assessment of the patient's prognosis through TnT is significantly and independently supplemented by means of CRP 4-24 h after admission and thus significantly improved.
A 51/2 year old girl with an optic nerve glioma resulting in internal hydrocephalus developed progressive ascites 7 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation.
A high protein content was found in the liquor and in the ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disruption of the blood-CSF barrier was found to be the cause of the increased CSF protein using CSF protein electrophoresis.
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
In the case of liver damage with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding requiring transfusion is increased.
While the diagnosis is simple, different treatment options are available.
The source of the bleeding is usually in varicose veins in the stoma, so that local sclerotherapy with 3% ethoxysklerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel is an option.
Resection of the varicose vein-bearing portion of the conduit is an option when bleeding is life-threatening or when the source of the bleeding cannot be localized.
In the case of frequently recurring bleeding, removing the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of every bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the best genetically characterized solid tumors:
A number of species-specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known that are associated with clinical parameters such as the tendency for meningiomas to recur or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression that is particularly typical of gliomas, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity, can be attributed to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also influenced iatrogenically by radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with progressive dyspnea due to thrombosis of a prosthetic mitral cap.
The patient had had a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) 6 years previously for mitral stenosis III.
Valve thrombosis occurred 3 years later, requiring valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
In the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been better understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial structure through loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix through proteolysis and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenetic factors that can lead to degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, exit from the vasculature, and induction of angiogenesis are other important steps in the metastatic process.
Furthermore, once a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will only survive if it evades immunological defence.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11.
This gene is believed to be one of the tumor suppressor genes whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasia.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but mostly have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 manifests itself most frequently between the ages of 20 and 35, primarily as a result of hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have dealt with the reduction of endothelial cell density after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods of the donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, since very variable follow-up examination intervals were summarized despite the long-known dynamic cell loss.
The aim of this investigation was to carry out a long-term endothelial assessment at the same dates, taking into account two different preservation techniques.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have different levels of perioperative thromboembolic risk, which requires continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In the case of elective interventions, the administration of coumarin is discontinued 2-3 days before the operation; in the case of emergency interventions, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution is necessary.
Operations on patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less of a problem, since the heparin effect wears off within a few hours when the heparin is discontinued.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
Applying the prevalence rates from more recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany results in estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems in patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded through a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of an opportunity to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent combination of the results of the survey of the individual groups of doctors resulted in a number of around 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is within the range of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "MS in question" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
In order to achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which then produce more growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be seen as a new, promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, the clinical application of which can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by their general practitioner.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of crucial importance for diagnosis and therapy.
While in the 1970s the doctor's conversational style was viewed as a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversations suggest understanding the doctor's conversational behavior as an interactive process in which both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior.
Training programs to improve general practitioners' basic psychosomatic competence often show little success because they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the center of the Düsseldorf training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
The advanced training concept and experiences with it are finally presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure are based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All of these sources can only be transferred to everyday clinical practice to a limited extent.
Programming the speech processor of a cochlear implant (CI) in young children, specifically determining the level of stimulation that corresponds to the Maximum Acceptable Loudness (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation must be avoided at all costs, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered via the CI and the MAL and hearing threshold values determined during the postoperative speech processor setting in 27 patients with three different implant types.
It was examined whether the ESR threshold is an applicable, objective instrument for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants paced in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as percentiles of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds sometimes showed large deviations from the thresholds actually determined by behavioral audiometry.
It was therefore not possible to reliably and easily calculate the MAL and the hearing threshold based on the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative function check, can contribute to a mathematical limitation of the area to be checked.
However, the determination of the exact MAL will have to be done in a different way, provisionally using behavioral audiometry.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swellings in the red portions of a multicolored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, there was a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction, which could be differentiated from a true lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological investigations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be the result of dermal allergic inflammation in the nongranulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic options in the kidney area using fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old female patient, a supernumerary mammary gland the size of a hen's egg and protruding the skin and without buds or areolas had developed in the left anterior axillary line over a period of 8 years.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
Arterial vessels adjacent to the joint can be damaged in connection with endoprosthetic operations.
Both highly acute and masked possible complications as well as the applied therapy are described on the basis of 4 case studies.
Before and after endoprosthetic operations, a vascular status of the extremities should be determined.
Delusions are understood as intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency towards subjective certainty which, as the object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on a mental disorder, lose their alienating character.
Imaginations from which delusion arises are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to actualize, which weighs heavily on the imagination and is increased in psychotic states, is a prerequisite for delusion.
Added to this must be the failure of de-actualization brought about by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by a casuistry, which proceed from the initial stages of the schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor that was first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive obstruction of nasal breathing due to thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was found in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed based on an overview of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the present study, we therefore present possibilities for examining finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers using color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that the display was possible for all subjects examined (n=10).
Furthermore, it is shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this size can be detected with the method - with the appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The objective of this retrospective study is to evaluate the need for cardioverter/defibrillator-generator (ICD) re-implantation in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical episode of arrhythmia during the lifetime of the initially implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems enables operations on the mitral valve to be carried out via a limited right anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
They are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a causal role.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the parts of the extremities close to the trunk.
By combining different imaging methods, the number of differential diagnoses can be limited to a few, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor.
Whereas in earlier years surgical resection had a monopoly position, adjuvant therapeutic measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are becoming increasingly important.
Mutilating interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are only justified if repeated, uncontrollable recurrences occur.
The treatment concept for atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-oriented anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic drugs are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant cases.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used in microbial superinfections.
An exacerbation can often be counteracted successfully with phototherapy, especially with UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or only represents a therapeutic alternative in a few exceptional cases.
The present case report describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented to the ENT department of the BwK Ulm for clarification with a watery nasal discharge, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-sided nasal breathing impairment.
Clinical examination and CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that completely filled the left nasal cavity and apparently originated from the middle meatus.
The tumor was resected in toto by midfacial degloving.
The histological work-up revealed the diagnosis of a neurinoma.
Based on this case report and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor is presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse, but they sometimes lead to significant impairments.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhage and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account when determining the indication for chemonucleolysis and when informing the patient.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is therapy-resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and non-invasive treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapeutic alternative to systemic treatment with dapsone.
Based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counseling/liaison services, the effectiveness of psychosomatic-dermatological counseling was examined more closely in the present study for the first time.
The extent of compliance after the treatment recommendation was recorded and its connection with possible influencing factors such as frequency of interview contacts, preference and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was examined.
Two years after the consultation, follow-up questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
In a random sample of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action, the compliance rate was 78.3%, based on the subgroup with a recommendation for psychotherapy a rate of 69%.
There was no significant correlation with clinical or demographic characteristics, and the frequency of conversations had no influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was held.
A positive attitude towards consultation and a pleasant conversation experience promoted compliance.
All in all, a high level of effectiveness could be achieved with relatively little expenditure of time and effort.
A 29-year-old woman with an unusual pigmented lesion on her face is reported.
From a clinical point of view, the pigment lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus, the histological diagnostics confirmed the existence of multiple blue nevi, and there was also a slightly pronounced lentiginous component and a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change turns out to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often require far more fluids intraoperatively than can be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid losses and ventilation.
Changes in the Starling forces - in particular the vascular permeability - possibly play a role here, without having been examined in detail up to now.
The discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, in particular about surgery-related complications, e.g. B. the so-called. Postdiskotomy syndrome, has led in the past to less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, were sought and used.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as B. discography, retroperitoneal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed to clinical maturity since the 1970s.
The results in patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results depending on the author and study.
What is striking here is that the prospective randomized studies that have comparison groups - whether patient groups treated conservatively or surgically - are very rare.
Here, the results of the intradiscal treatment methods are more often assessed critically and with lower success rates than e.g. T. retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers, but cannot stand up well to the hard scientific criteria of the study design.
Overall, it can be stated that the percutaneous nucleotomy procedure can only treat a part of the lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for a successful therapy.
At this point in time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures tend to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With more than 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This review article compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their importance when used after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
The hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8 h, 4-7 h and 2-6 h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems was able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is essentially based on the removal of the sheath immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial occlusion systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula of the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, for some time we have also been stripping the internal limiting membrane (MLI) from the retina in the vicinity of the foramen.
The clinical results and the ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and primary dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, nondiagnostic first electrocardiogram, before-hospital time >= 12 h, or unknown before-hospital time.
In order to describe these patient groups and to compare the effect of lysis and primary dilatation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individually Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died in a hepatic coma of fulminant viral hepatitis 5 days after the first symptoms appeared.
The serological diagnosis showed healed hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis only detected postmortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (over several days) in the pulmonary circulation with subsequent extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
The tau protein in the liquor cerebrospinalis was determined in 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementia of other causes and 36 cognitively normal controls.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total score on the mini mental state test 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these compared to the controls.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In the Alzheimer's patients, no quantitative correlation was found between the increase in tau and the severity of the dementia or the cerebral perfusion deficit determined by SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau could also be elevated in the pre-demented stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustular dermatitis, especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustulations were evident.
The present work describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem after vascular reconstructive surgery.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Decreased programmed cell death (apoptosis) may also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival of intimal cells, leading to cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy specimens from 25 primary and 14 restenotic lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were analyzed using the TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with Re than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As a key finding of this study, restenotic hypercellular tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimal plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In contrast, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two types of plaque (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Our data thus point to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying form of cell death, with differences between both lesion types and significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia commonly seen in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
A detailed description of the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas follows with regard to cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been rising continuously for years.
The prognosis depends to a large extent on rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and the initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the clinical examination, which is usually diagnostic.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the termination of an inappropriately started antibiotic therapy and a review of the blood culture techniques used, or the use of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with a potentiating toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so that they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the cheapest antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg/ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolisms do not constitute a contraindication to heart-lung machine surgery if primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and the operation is performed early (< 72 hours) before a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder develops.
A significant improvement in the prognosis through early surgical intervention has also been proven for disease progressions caused by myocardial insufficiency (particularly as a result of acute valve insufficiency), the occurrence of acute renal failure, a contact infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet or a more than 48-hour despite antibiotic therapy are complicated by persistent sepsis.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, since the large, "cystic" cerebral ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology not only describes the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain areas in which one finds either an increased or decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act put the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new basis.
Both certain clinical pictures in the event of suspicion, illness or death must be reported (essentially by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates which information must be provided by the reporting party with the report.
It also determines which information may be transmitted by the health department.
Especially in the case of suspicious activity reports or the reporting of pathogen evidence, not all of the information that is required to be transmitted is always available from the report, so the health department must carry out investigations itself in these cases in order to be able to transmit the relevant information.
The health authorities also have the task of merging incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
Case definitions were developed for this. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information that is required to be transmitted.
The transmission to the RKI then takes place via the competent state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to information from the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer patients usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions, which lead to a significant loss of quality of life if there is insufficient or no treatment.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his family.
Various organizations have therapy concepts for adequate pain therapy, but these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as the site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases lead to laboratory analysis of reduced values of the hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of an increased turnover of plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the hemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxae, clinically, bleeding usually occurs with more or less constellation of findings similar to consumption coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis and only exceptionally thromboembolism.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after sutureless corneal cataract surgery.
In the context of fall prevention, among other things, a routine review of medication is required.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over the age of 75, it was examined how often drugs are prescribed that can increase the risk of falls by possibly causing dizziness.
The amount of bleeding from the same mediastinal drainage after cardiac surgery in adults differs between individual cardiac centers by up to 8 times.
Excessive postoperative bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, use of autologous blood, and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol reduce the use of allogeneic transfusions.
Perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical guidelines of the European Union.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with persistent commitment and great effort.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to their work, maxillofacial surgery is now, at the end of the 20th century, recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with around 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, spreading fungi into the middle ear can have serious complications.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to clean up the external auditory canal, especially preoperatively.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparison solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for iv infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical interventions on the eye, were examined with regard to their possible influence checked for the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
Mean age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
60% had coronary artery disease and 31% dilated cardiomyopathy as underlying cardiac disease.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and 43% survived resuscitation due to ventricular fibrillation.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
A subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted in 25 patients and an epicardial patch system in 2 patients, the implantation site was abdominal in 92 patients and pectoral in 248.
A total of 34 lead-related complications occurred in 33 patients (9.7%).
Eighteen of the patients with a lead-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral device, the rate of lead-related complications was 12% for the dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators, three times that of the 4% for the single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators (p=0.05).
In more than half of the patients (55%) the diagnosis was made primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, in a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain) and in a fifth (21%) on the basis of the electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of the radiosynoviorthesis in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was examined.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not have an X-ray tube that rotates mechanically around the patient. Instead, an electron beam is directed onto targets arranged semi-circularly around the patient, where the actual X-ray radiation is then produced.
With this ultra-fast technology, it has become possible to generate axial slice images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely image all the structures of the heart with a spatial resolution of <0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cross-sectional images (slice thickness 2-3 mm) during a short period of apnea enables the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcifications with EBT must be regarded as the currently most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method can be seen in respiratory and movement artifacts, overlapping of the coronary arteries with veins and pronounced coronary calcifications, assuming a stable sinus rhythm.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive representations of coronary arteries have already become possible with EBT, which can possibly be optimized through further technical advances.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established procedure of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging procedure for examining this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, the results of the examination were consistent with those of the angiography in a large proportion of the patients.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle is dominated by a high systolic component, there is a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial flow bed in the form of an increased diastolic flow component.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography when assessing the result of revascularization postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male, hypertensive patients over 60 years of age, who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are extremely rare.
Young patients with or without a direct trauma history predominate here.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the middle cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The contribution shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old people's and nursing homes.
The adjustment should strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and force the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, rather it is the task of the management bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions, taking into account the respective framework conditions.
A phenotypically female newborn of 37 weeks' gestation is reported, which died on the 14th day of life with symptoms of renal insufficiency.
The child had a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and unusually severe, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been among the most common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in western industrialized nations.
While accidents involving older children and adolescents mostly occur on the road and are consistently recorded and documented, there is no up-to-date epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infants and small children, which tend to occur during activities at home.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and small children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
Two cases (female, 37 and 47 years old) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts are reported, which had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint.
In both cases there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate the passage of the blood enriched with contrast agent through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of the myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method has been delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation and on the other hand by the fact that only one slice per heartbeat can be imaged with conventional techniques.
New developments in both magnetic resonance tomographs and strategies for accelerated image acquisition make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echo planar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is reinforced by the variety of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood flow conditions in ligament ruptures are an essential parameter, especially with regard to the chances of success of surgical treatment, the vascularization of the knee medial ligament should be presented in the present work.
The special perfusion situation was examined by means of microangiography on 21 cadaver preparations.
A supply from proximal through 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which preferably ran in the ventral parts of the ligament, was found.
Vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal parts of the ligament, we would recommend ligament reconstruction using fibrin glue, which allows an atraumatic reconstruction without the risk of vascular strangulation caused by the suture.
Approximately 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease (approx. 75% of all heart operations) are treated surgically in Germany every year.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, primarily the vena saphena magna, are available as bypass material.
Minimally invasive vein harvesting techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery in recent years, but today saphenectomy is largely performed using a continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin to openly dissect the great saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up treatment after coronary surgical interventions and a reason for the appreciation of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only minor limitation caused by the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation of the anterior chest wall with aplasia of the sterno-costal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly, and occasionally associated other defects of the chest wall, nipple, and breast.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the simultaneous occurrence of dextrocardia and Poland syndrome have been described.
We report on another patient with this rare combined malformation.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels can predict impending sepsis early on and the severity of the course of sepsis.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offers of the various magazines and publishers are very different in terms of quality and quantity.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including, for example, low production costs and fast availability of information, independent of location and time.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but will represent a useful addition to the current range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who developed the rare form of a purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police raid".
This case report describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a type 2 secondary aortoenteric fistula to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The preoperative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of preoperative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical therapy methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not carried out in Germany.
According to opponents of PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents believe that from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude a PGD.
Against the background of this situation, a PGD has not yet been carried out in Germany.
The discussion that has been going on in Germany for a long time is difficult to convey to scientific circles abroad.
Based on case reports, it was to be assumed that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic focus of pus.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective clinical study.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unclear origin (FUO) as an illness developing over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C on at least three days, the etiology of which remains unclear even after a one-week inpatient investigation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta, and tuberculosis.
In this work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
With the help of a rapidly hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measurement area, impressions are made of the skin which correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent metrological procedure, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
Using a statistics program, the measurement data can be analyzed, saved and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after application of estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The partition ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the forensic blood alcohol testing guidelines for converting serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicentre study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in whom blood tests are ordered in connection with offenses under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21 was measured.
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19. In relation to the mean, the deviation of the quotient is less than 3% in 96% of the cases.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
The pathophysiology is typically based on the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-to-left shunt via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic diseases in children that change during growth through reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible through the use of generally recognized assessment standards.
Vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission by palpation of wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and Doppler signal recording over the wrist arteries.
The first step in the emergency operations performed on all 10 children was fragment reposition and fixation with crossed K-wires via an extensor access.
Subsequent assessment of blood flow revealed a return of pulse in 2 of the 10 children (transient, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
In 8 of the 10 children there was no pulse, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we saw a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In adventitious strangulations (2 of these 5 children), the pulse was transmitted to the hand immediately after the fibrous, strangulating tissue was severed.
In the case of intimal damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vessel section was resected and reconstructed, mostly in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patchplasty.
We saw a combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses could be palpated in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal by color duplex sonography, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the brachial, radial and ulnar arteries.
Late ischemic damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann's contracture) was not found in any of the children.
Elbow joint mobility assessment revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and equilateral normal pronation and supination.
The weight-bearing joint axis was normal in all children when comparing the sides.
The culture detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful for paediatricians, since the pathogen can only be cultivated in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400 mg RRR-tocopherol acetate/d) versus diclofenac sodium (3x50 mg/d) was tested in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and treatment with diclofenac (n=43) showed a significant improvement in all clinical parameters examined.
The duration of morning stiffness was reduced from 90 min to 68 min with vitamin E therapy and from 68 min to 30 min with diclofenac intake.
The Ritchie joint index fell from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac).
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E group and the diclofenac group.
There was also a significant reduction in the severity of pain in both groups, assessed using a 10cm visual analog scale.
The overall assessment of the doctor and patient regarding the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be filled with air or even overinflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
One such observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary foregut anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by occlusion of the esophagus and by Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly developed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l) after intoxication with synthetic drugs ("ecstasy" and "speed") within a few weeks.
With a decompensated diabetic metabolism (HbA1c initially 11.7%), the insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, when the first ketoacidosis manifested, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate fluid intake.
The clinical picture showed peritoneal symptoms in addition to dehydration and tachycardia;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and delusions of persecution are essentially related to the drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin replacement.
The processes were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variability of a Smeloff cutter prosthesis in the aortic position 24 years after implantation is reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellowish discoloration, gouging and cracking with swelling and a subtotal fracture.
This resulted in a terminal prosthesis dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients were treated arthroscopically on an outpatient basis for osteochondritis dissecans of the talus roll and followed up after 4 and 12 months according to a standardized protocol.
It turned out that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement about the stage of the osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the lesions were located in the dorsal portions of the talar roll, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, tibial cannulation, or distraction.
Arthroscopy also enables partial synovectomy in the case of concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes on the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical result make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the ankle.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while this is already greater in the case of pulmonary edema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
Nevertheless, the mortality from cardiogenic shock whose cause cannot be treated is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 volunteers, cognitive performance disorders after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam were recorded quantitatively using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT).
The disorders partially corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transitory syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, all subjects had complete anterograde amnesia with no clearing tendency.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident through the detection of a gross rotary nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam ingestion.
Presentation of the development status and the clinical suitability of solutions using internet technology for the distribution of images and findings and for video conference applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a qualitatively very good representation of the extracranial carotid flow path in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be visualized without contrast media.
The application of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables a first-pass imaging of the carotids from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s measurement time after intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
In this thesis, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast medium-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the quantity and flow rate of contrast medium (CM) injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid blood return flow from the venous sinus into the jugular veins must be taken into account.
First, the optimal time for data acquisition with regard to the presence of KM in the arteries was determined using a model and a computer simulation.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By gradually varying the spatial resolution, measurement time and contrast medium injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on test persons and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid artery.
The best qualitative results were obtained with a double-dose technique at 2 ml/s injection speed.
The time reserves of ultra-fast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further investigations into the optimal KM application with the still very early state of the art are still pending.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures serve to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and suitable patient selection and information.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drilling channels including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a transplant impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
The postoperative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, the early start of an exercise program and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided if the measures mentioned are taken into account.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasia, the surgical therapy options have important tasks.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring the drainage of secretions and the reduction of pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination with the integration of all conservative therapy options.
In many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present work describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for the palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the sick elderly is one of the most common and under-recognized diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or home care settings.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population examined, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% has been reported.
This leads to a lack of energy, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as in the case of acute or chronic illness, and combined with this to general malnutrition.
For an accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable tailor-made nutritional therapy.
The most important deficiencies in the sick elderly are protein, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, generates enormous healthcare costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will intensify.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as an independent disease and integrating it into the curriculum of the training of doctors and nursing staff.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows that ELND is an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor localization and gender of the tumor carrier.
In the stratification according to the prognosis parameters mentioned, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with melanomas >2.5 - 4 mm thick on the head, neck, thorax and acras;
Men with melanomas > 1.5 - 4 mm thick in the same location and with > 2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the arms, legs and abdomen (except acral and genitoanal locations).
The limits of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing concrete risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Driving license applicants are not only required to have adequate eyesight, but also legally to be able to use it "reliably".
The nystagmus patient strives for this in that he z. B. assumes a forced head-to-eye posture or uses other compensation mechanisms.
However, according to the applicable investigation guidelines (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. Road Traffic Licensing Regulations), it is precisely these that are not permitted.
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retained vellus hairs in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedo-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the mid dermis with a preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retained keratin, and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be visualized histologically using Warthin-Starry stain or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, e.g. T. Ulcerated node.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as the bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA presenting with multiple cutaneous nodules and bony changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in regression of all disease symptoms.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column was performed using the thoracoscopic technique.
Due to the increase in experience, the operation times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open procedure.
Our own experiences prove the fundamental feasibility of a minimally invasive treatment.
Significant advantages compared to the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and a shorter inpatient stay.
Aim of the operation Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with a solid, intramedullary locking intramedullary nail using the non-reaming technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of the supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for assessing the shape of the acromion in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal slices and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion shape was compared to the classification according to Bigliani in the conventional radiograph.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis includes various clinical pictures that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often caused by bacteria, no pathogen can be detected in the second group.
In particular, the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to recur, have a long course and can also show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy serves primarily to rule out a tumor and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There are no histological options for distinguishing between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis.
Social work with the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically aging society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and has triggered the search for a more attractive performance profile that can be reached by consensus in the fields of social work with the elderly.
Using the direct immunofluorescence method, we were able to demonstrate linear deposits of IgG lambda L chains, an early component of complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along the preserved elastic fibers in the dermis, particularly in the stratum papillare, in the patient the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands, and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and therefore also subject to a high degree of injury.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most severe injuries, very often only residual or replacement functions can be gained.
The complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage to the soft tissue and the bony skeleton with an acute threat to the vitality or the essential functions of the hand.
Basically, a comprehensive first aid is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is the priority.
The destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed as far as this is possible.
This is followed by the microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
If the bones or tendons are exposed, the skin coat is replaced by a pedicled or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of a long period of ischemia, this concept is deviated from insofar as the blood flow is restored first.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every function of the hand that is regained or created counts.
It is therefore irresponsible to take care of such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements of a special department.
The treatment of symptomatic multivessel coronary disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large, randomized studies with comparable clinical success and risk.
After PTCA, however, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long term, according to the BARI study, mortality in diabetic patients was lower in the operated group.
The individual therapy recommendation by the attending physician has also proven to be an important factor in the patient's prognosis.
The influence of the newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized studies.
We report on a 34-year-old patient with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata, which occurred 4 years after pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
In order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases from the group of parapsoriatic changes and their relationship to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases showed characteristic histological changes and a predominantly lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor within both changes could not be verified.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case unrelated to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a suspected tumor lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resection edge (R 0 or R 1) must be as precise and unambiguous as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful for breast excisions:
1) Radiopaque threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
When sevoflurane comes into contact with the CO2 absorbers of the parts of the anesthetic circuit, compound A is formed, which could have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in human volunteers aimed at analyzing the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
A total of three studies in volunteers investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% by volume, with fresh gas flows of around 2 L/min each being used.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from the renal tubular cells in the urine of subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent investigations then found either irrelevant or even no changes in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined volunteers with 3 vol.% sevoflurane administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
When applying these results to clinical practice, the experimental nature of the anesthesia used in these studies must be taken into account.
Although the issue of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, studies in human volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical investigations, indicate that renal function after surgery under low-flow conditions is similar to that after isoflurane.
So far, there has been no published experience in the therapy of paraphilias (paedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (lutein releasing hormone) agonists in German-speaking countries.
In this study, we describe 11 patients treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate over a 12-month study period.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive actions and, according to the patients, there was a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods seem to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
We therefore examined five different intraoperative warming measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and co-workers first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the ultra-pulse CO2 laser, a further developed device is available that enables other possible uses in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty using both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the examiner.
Both methods are available nationwide in Germany.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has gained paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to special questions, phlebography is indispensable.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for venography.
In many institutions, the two procedures are used as a "golden partnership" when comprehensive documentation is required.
The chronic rejection reaction is the most important unresolved problem in kidney transplantation today.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosomes Y and X. In a further step, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to detect the to characterize infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are primarily composed of T-lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association as one of the methods that shorten the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey was intended to clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision-making tool to determine brain death, mostly in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The discussion revealed that the investigators consciously reported borderline situations in which e.g. T. the conditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases was ultrasound used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further secure the diagnosis, more rarely as the sole method that shortens the waiting time.
Microsomal heme oxygenase (HO) is exclusively responsible for the endogenous formation of CO. It is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
Therefore, in the present work, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme was examined after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerol leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the stratum corneum lipids into liquid-crystalline states.
Especially when used in an O/W emulsion, it improves the hydration of the stratum corneum to a considerable extent that is well above the effect of urea.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus the horny layer desquamation.
Especially with long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be increased by glycerin.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerin-containing preparations in terms of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerin also has a protective effect against the effects of surfactants and against lipophilic pollutants.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol causes a flux from the depths of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, like urea, glycerol can improve drug penetration.
Aim of the operation Aim of the operation Stabilization of the posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by means of a posterior bone block and a capsular plasty.
Long-term complications resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to longer operating times and the increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have only been used in exceptional cases to date.
We present our results of total arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Material and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with multivessel coronary disease underwent complete arterial revascularization in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, bilateral internal thoracic arteries in 105 patients (25.9%), internal thoracic artery and radial artery in 299 patients (73.8%) and 1 radial artery in 1 patient (0.3%). .
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in a T-configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
In-hospital mortality was 2%.
Sternal wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of the patients.
Complications after removal of the radial artery were not recorded except for temporary paresthesia.
In the angiographic control 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of the coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for treating multivessel coronary artery disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic thigh fractures after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and the first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of the intracranial pressure has acquired a key position within neuromonitoring, although the actual metabolic processes in the central neuron cannot be registered directly and only with a time delay due to the intracranial pressure.
A prerequisite for a reliable intracranial pressure measurement are specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which will be examined in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functions and measurement properties.
We practice partial sphincterectomy as part of cataract surgery with a very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly due to a ring of fibrosis of the sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly being researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been discussed.
In the present work, works published in the literature on the subject of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to focal points and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work has been rare so far, and the existing measuring instruments for children's quality of life are described.
Increased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the recording of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, in therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasion in 1957 because of skin changes which, based on the available biographical material, must be classified as the beginning of a rhinophyma.
The artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the nose area, can be proven throughout his entire creative phase.
As one of the founders of Pop Art, Warhol has had a significant impact on modern society with his oeuvre, thereby also influencing our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen), specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and living liver donations.
Experiences with the program are available for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After active non-specific immunotherapy adjuvantly and palliatively influenced the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves gene transfer, which can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, there are:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells that have been transfected with a cytokine gene or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or Transfection of tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results could not be estimated exactly up to now.
In 309 inpatients treated with talk psychotherapy and re-examined one year later, it is shown to what extent raters on the scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES can be influenced by defensive attitudes of the patients, which are evaluated with the validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and pouring test were measured:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability") and the tendency to appear unremarkable and normal.
Their relative improvements (effect size rating scales) are smaller as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient talk psychotherapy strengthened the defenses in aggravating patients and reduced them in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and then timely surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot, adapted to the severity of the deformity, about 25% recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause appears to be the lack of concentric reduction and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
Forefoot adduction and supination are the most common deformities.
The age-dependent surgical procedure is presented based on the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual clubfoot patients (patients < 10 years).
From the age of 8 to 10, metatarsal osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator and, as a last resort, triple arthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show a marked variability in their clinical morphology.
We report on a 77-year-old woman with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-like appearance we suggest the expression "nevus corymbiformis".
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (explosion in costs in the transfusion system, the fate of individual patients), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine poses a challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anesthetic method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and automated autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow patients with large intraoperative blood losses to avoid the transfusion of allogeneic blood.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel maternity home and midwifery school, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetric medicine.
He aligned research and teaching to what was empirically comprehensible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determining the dimensions of the pelvis and inspecting the Michaelis rhombus named after him gave him a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness characterized his research:
He self-critically published medical failures and critically examined new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm the teachings of Semmelweis on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
Out of despair over the deaths of many patients in childbirth, for which he was partly responsible, he committed suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-known conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can be used to trigger temporary stimulus effects in circumscribed areas of the human cortex.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions about language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for safety of use are given.
Facial nerve neuromas are rare, benign tumors that usually occur along the distal intratemporal portion of the nerve, grow extratemporally, and are then noticed as an extracranial mass.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial paralysis.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, a progressive left-sided sensorineural disturbance and mild peripheral facial paralysis without a deficit in tear secretion.
The neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The tumor was removed via an extradural "middle fossa approach" without injuring the motor facial nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated major petrosal nerve neuroma without involvement of the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) is when there is a continuous seizure or multiple seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, the current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients; if unsuccessful, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
Therapy-refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternative active substances that can be used.
Either tendon transposition or tendon transplantation is recommended for treatment of an old rupture of the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle.
The surgical treatment with an augmented reversal plastic is described using a case study;
3 years after the surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with a good functional result.
The reversal plastic has the advantage that there are no functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding the prognosis and treatment strategies for many clinical pictures.
The analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well defined and tested in large prospective studies, serve to record this parameter in intensive care patients.
In contrast, the ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis of chronic cardiac insufficiency are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, diseases that are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be gaining increasing appeal in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report on 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the scalp hair.
The anamnesis revealed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
Examination of the hair using atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
Based on our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the uptake of copper through the water in our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint sheet, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by the median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of the terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
This parameter improved already 6 weeks postoperatively, and 74% of the transplant recipients found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
The patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical fitness (87%) and their state of health (80%) before the operation.
Six weeks post-transplant, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients showing high levels of satisfaction with health status and 51% with exercise capacity.
Although the patients assessed their psychological well-being as good even before the HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (pre-op
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 months postop.
Quality of life before HTx correlated best with health status (r=0.61, p<0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities improved after HTx in only about 28% of the patients.
90% suffered from one or more complaints after the transplantation, mostly side effects of the immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal cardiac insufficiency, all areas of quality of life, with the exception of psychological well-being, improve significantly as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite excessive expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and contusion bleeding after a bicycle crash [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The mass-occupying hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values necessitated a 10-day barbiturate coma.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic lung failure on day 8 after trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
In the period that followed, the patient developed a massive restriction in mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction/ adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
Pelvic overview and computed tomography showed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hips (Brooker type IV).
The HOs were removed in two stages 2 years after the accident, each via a Smith-Petersen approach.
HO recurrence prophylaxis was carried out by means of a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/day) over 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection are as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can work as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp sequence within the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
Using PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes could be amplified, as well as those of some yeasts and molds.
Dermatophytes and Candida albicans were identified by hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed dermatophytes to be differentiated from yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of the PCR for fungi was checked on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the method, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were analyzed by PCR and culture.
With the PCR, dermatophytes were detected in 35 and with the culture in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples.
The sensitivity of the PCR (92%) was higher than that of the culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture when detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has contributed to a better understanding of wrist anatomy and pathology.
A special diagnostic task of the radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the evaluation of the kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and the scapholunate ligaments are the most common indications for arthroscopic surgery.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has found increasing application in forensic practice, in archeology, and in evolutionary and population genetic studies over the past decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special attention to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological investigations is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their size and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work aimed at obtaining mitochondrial DNA from ground-stored teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented that could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the work presented is to present the findings reported in the literature and our own observations.
Microperimetric investigations after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting loss of pigment epithelium.
The surgical effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its high soft-tissue contrast, is the imaging method of choice for depicting the intra-articular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, unenhanced MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows direct visualization of labral lesions by distending the joint space and marking the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences enable assessment in the crucial cranioventral sections.
The labrum lesions can be divided into different, clinically relevant stages with the MRA.
In addition, accompanying lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) can also be displayed.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
No complications have occurred in the more than 100 arthrographies that have been performed.
Based on this experience, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
In this review we present the technique and results of the MRA method we use.
It was found that the variceal wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, and the vein wall below a still intact vein valve was also affected.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the synopsis of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of the primary destruction of the valve and the subsequent varicose remodeling of the vein cannot be confirmed; it is much more likely that there is a change in the vein wall and thus also valve insufficiency.
Arterial injuries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be absent in the area of the hand, which is supplied by two arteries.
Hypothenar Hammer syndrome represents occlusion of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually insidious and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a result of the accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
In this study, the medium-term intraocular pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery should be examined.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combination of anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance with propofol results in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anesthetic drugs or techniques.
This article will show how to best take advantage of propofol's antiemetic effects.
The possible effects of propofol on the cortex cerebri and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the pros and cons of propofol in reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of the postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined orthodontic and prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous maxilla by means of a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of endosseous implants is only rarely included in the preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was determined for 23 patients based on the production of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skeleton and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special consideration of the anterior tooth aesthetics.
The surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified in 8 patients due to the preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic result achieved.
The profile prognosis with video imaging means a useful decision-making aid when planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw, in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - the extent of the upper jaw advancement, the direction of insertion of endosseous implants and the type of superstructure.
A large nodular, multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, whose unusual clinical and histological aspect initially did not allow the diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change from the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells and the lack of evidence of specific cell organelles were able to confirm the nature of the disease.
For the treatment of diseases of the rheumatic type, thymus preparations, among others, are offered on the German pharmaceutical market.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study designs, and studies that do not allow any scientifically founded statements due to the short study duration and small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations in rheumatic diseases (e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be made on this basis with a sufficient, according to the state of the art, positive benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment derive
We report on an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the right hepatic artery in a 64-year-old woman.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, there were repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to shock symptoms, the determination of the cause of which was difficult in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising treatment option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of the stroke are recognized quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 hours after the onset of the first symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
Symptoms go unnoticed or are trivialized by patients, relatives, or witnesses.
The increase in this number can be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the general public and emergency medical personnel.
The current standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and therapy for hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with orally administered methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate (=percentage of patients who remained in the study program for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and length of stay were defined as target parameters.
With a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a trend in retention rate (p=0.06) in favor of the group treated with methadone.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) tended to be higher, with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
With regard to the additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, no significant difference between the two could be ascertained during the course of treatment.
Methadone turned out to be the more successful substance in terms of length of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and how meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional treatment failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the probability of occurrence of hematogenous metastases?
Between August 1, 1990 and October 1, 1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined with regard to clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In accordance with the therapy concept, 25/139 patients underwent a radical neck dissection after completion of the radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage".
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%) the condition could be controlled locoregionally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally healed tumor disease, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
The tumor control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time of patients with locoregional treatment failure was 17 months.
At this time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/62) of the locoregionally uncontrolled patients, compared to only 4/77 (5%) of the locoregionally healed patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau at 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indicator for the likelihood of distant metastases developing.
Therapy failure is caused by the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume acquisition and spatial and temporal resolution in CT has been reached.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current therapy of viper bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect consists in the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients undergoing a wide range of reparative and reconstructive distal extensor knee repairs.
The MPT fixator was applied in mounting form A in 44 patients and in mounting form B in 23 patients.
In 4 patients there was a deep infection, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients who were treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous reattachment of the patellar ligament for caudal comminuted fractures and 12 patients with transosseous suture reattachment of the patellar ligament for avulsions and tears at the inferior pole of the patella or suture adaptation of the patellar ligament for intraligamentous rupture, in whom no other surgery was performed apart from the extensor apparatus, were examined Provisions on the knee joint took place.
In 2 patients the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a strength deficit of the extensor muscles on the operated leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite side.
In summary, it can be stated that the EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven itself in continuity-restoring interventions on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint and represents an efficient alternative to patellotibial dissection with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible nowadays to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies that have been evaluated in clinical studies.
Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible ocular involvement in children, is presented on the basis of a case report of a 6-year-old boy.
In areas exposed to light, numerous acute hemorrhagic vesicles appear at the beginning of the sunny season, recurrently up to adulthood, and heal with scarring.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in using the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynaecology.
The central type of recording in X-ray diagnostics in oral and maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic tomography.
The reduction of the dose requirement is still due to further developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such. B. sensors or imaging plates have become possible.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional types of imaging make imaging by means of computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging unavoidable for numerous clinical questions in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows changes in the cortical bone to be imaged due to the shorter measurement times.
For certain questions, such as B. changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine methods allow an imaging-supported functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is used today on an inpatient and outpatient basis, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients whose body awareness is reduced, whose emotionality is limited or who, due to character resistance, are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are presented with brief examples, while other methods are pointed out.
The effective factors mentioned include the connection of affects to the vegetative and voluntary nervous system, as well as the close connection between psychological and physical processes that exists especially at the beginning of life, which is connected to the form of interaction experienced and has psychobiological effects.
In the further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic meaning that is important for the therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented approaches to verbal psychotherapy, particularly psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideals and family reality, which have been shaped by various current and previous experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic work leaves a lot of leeway for the individual to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy for psychotherapists in particular to implement a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic work on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
In their training, psychotherapists should give the same attention to their personal relationships as they do to therapeutic relationships with patients.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced cardiac insufficiency is becoming increasingly important among patients with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly reduced at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been the treatment of choice for heart failure that is refractory to medication.
However, the growing mismatch between the supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
Promising new conservative and alternative surgical therapy approaches have been developed in recent years.
Conventional drug therapy was improved through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers with anticongestive effects.
Surgical therapy for advanced heart failure has been expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assist hearts, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ventricular reduction surgery, cardiomyoplasty, and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a temporary measure or as medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of the treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registers.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum, the occurrence of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapy procedures over a period of one year.
On the other hand, there were 122 manual therapy procedures performed on the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine by the respective ward physicians who had completed further training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture (pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar spine syndromes), the manual therapy referred primarily to secondary findings in other spinal levels in patients with the mentioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of an impacted mandibular tooth from its site of attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present a case of migration of an impacted lower premolar into the muscular process, which was documented over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending ramus of the mandible into the muscular process took place after the end of root growth, after the patient was 20 years old.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there concrete causes for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate carcinoma and cases curatively treatable by radical prostatovesiculectomy is increasing.
The exact pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no internationally standardized method for processing the preparations, it is difficult to compare different scientific studies.
The precisely defined, rational preservation of the preparations that we propose should eliminate these problems and help to improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The rapid increase in the requirements for documentation, performance recording, cost-effectiveness and quality control require the use of EDP tools in the clinic.
A client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use in the orthopedic clinic of the Justus Liebig University in Gießen since 1992 and has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific requirements of the clinically active doctor have been taken into account.
The application contains the basic functions of patient master data management, surgical planning (scheduling of interventions, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and interventions), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Thanks to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server in MedXS, content and functions can be called up at the same time from the intranet or the Internet using any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of the interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by unspecific neurological symptoms and, above all, facial dysmorphism.
However, the presence of congenital leukoderma (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered to be relatively typical and usually pointing the way.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
Therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
Individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM have manifest cardiac insufficiency, which is treated with medication according to the usual therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to examine a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patellar replacement in the context of total knee prosthesis is generally still very controversial.
In this context, there is our need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just in comparison to the prosthetically fitted patella.
The fact that for almost 5 years we have only carried out the patella replacement in special cases has made available to us a patient population on which this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 total prosthetic knees documented with a 2-year follow-up, we carried out a targeted survey of the patella shift and tilt, first on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar sliding bearing, and the results on the range of motion achieved after 2 years and persistent pain symptoms in relation.
An adaptation of the bony silhouette of the patella to the prosthesis sliding bearing was regularly observed with compression of the peripheral bone contact zone with or without a fibrous spacer layer;
Based on their clinical follow-up examination, 7 patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" because they had residual symptoms (n = 3) or a range of motion of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with a postoperative shift of more than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with a postoperative tilt of more than 15 degrees (n = 3) found.
Within this group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility correlated with a severe preoperative shift, also with a significant difference to the group without problems.
A patient with severe secondary deterioration of the patella (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic loosening of the tibial prosthesis represents a special case.
After changing the tibial components to correct the axis, this patient also became free of symptoms and had good mobility without any surgical measures having been carried out on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
Thus, the conclusion is obvious that for the recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm, a greater effort seems justified:
In addition to common surgical steps during implantation that have a favorable effect on the course of the kneecap, e.g. B. a high quadriceps shift or a medially offset reattachment of the detached tuberosity may be necessary.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the non-prosthetic patella shows an amazing adaptability to the prosthesis plain bearing due to remodeling of the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative misalignment, in which we had not performed a replacement due to good postoperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized patellar progression.
Whether in such cases there is an extended indication for patella replacement remains to be seen.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for the external quality assurance measures.
Through the introduction of comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing clinic structures.
So far, measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes have been in the foreground.
Rehabilitation-specific training courses were carried out to increase employee satisfaction and qualifications.
New future-oriented perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Aim of the operation Avoidance or elimination of compression on the nerve structures.
The present work provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that defects in the respiratory chain occur more frequently in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland and also in the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasia.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas preferentially occur in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
Which molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for this is still largely unknown.
We present a case of skin lesions similar to acrodermatitis enteropathica in a patient on long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to the autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes in this patient are also based on a zinc deficiency in the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermatitis and a random sample of 52 people with healthy skin are compared in terms of their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The skin diseases examined differ significantly from people with healthy skin in terms of an impaired sex life.
The exchange of tenderness is in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatics feel more impaired than patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been asked about their sex life by their doctor.
Despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor for skin and venereal diseases should be a competent discussion partner for questions relating to the skin disease and its consequences for sex life.
The conventional radiograph must still be regarded as the basic examination when there is a clinical question about an inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bony inflammatory destruction, but also allows assessment of their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image is able to indicate a clinical relapse situation via the collateral phenomena and to show the inflammatory increase in volume of the joints and tendon sheaths directly and indirectly.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed representation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR - offers highly specific information for some special questions, especially in the trunk skeleton and in individual large joints, partly for the definitive diagnosis, partly also for operation planning.
This applies to the sacroiliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
The treatment of open lower leg fractures II degree and III degree with simultaneous soft tissue damage today includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done with the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
Only through the associated successes has it been possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the high rate of disabling amputations and infections.
Initially, these were only isolated case observations, but there were increasing signs that these patients often had soft tissue problems in the lower leg, ranging from recurrent swelling to leg ulcers.
A clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy test persons showed that more than 50% of all patients suffered clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The degrees of severity of this damage range from a simple tendency to swelling to ulcus cruris, which gain in clinical relevance with increasing time distance to the accident event.
Strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required to avoid further damage, including iatrogenic damage, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Aim of the operation Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of limb form and function.
Mucins are heavily glycosylated glycoproteins that contain a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrate and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in the antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent results also indicate that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognosis markers.
This work gives an overview of the gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including our own findings.
Through the establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany, a network of outpatient and inpatient areas with the general practitioners, internal and orthopedic rheumatologists, physiotherapists, ergotherapists and psychologists as well as the acute and rehabilitation clinics working there has been achieved.
Rheumatological control centers can contribute in the long term to further improving the cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatic patients and to ensure quantitative and qualitative continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic patients in the sense of comprehensive rheumatological quality management.
Despite the increasing frequency of medico-legal problems, knowledge about the type and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is poor.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 cases of complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical associations of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert commissions identified treatment errors.
The complaint concerned the surgeon in 95%, the anesthesiologist in 2%, both disciplines in 3% and an ENT specialist in one case.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine interventions on the thyroid gland.
Typical surgical complications such as recurrent nerve paresis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postoperative bleeding (3%) and late recurrence (1%) accounted for 63% of allegations of treatment errors, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), residual nodes (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of allegations but 70% of treatment errors.
Only 11% of the identified treatment errors had insufficient information.
The determination of a treatment error was particularly frequent when a repeat operation was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001) or when a complication was followed by an error in the follow-up treatment (p < 0.001).
The area "Environment and Health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes significant problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this area led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications are bilateral renal tumors, renal tumors in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Improvements in operational strategy - such as perfusion in hypothermia and work-bench surgery - can save more than 95% of patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors from a nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving renal tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are recommending the extension of parenchyma-sparing renal tumor surgery to a selected group of patients with contralateral healthy kidneys (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection seems small.
The prognosis after the manifestation of local recurrences is poor in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been described most frequently in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report on 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast carcinoma or carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
background and question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective, but above all has few side effects.
The following is a report on a patient who, as part of this combination treatment, developed pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the healed psoriasis foci.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
Various lithotriptors have been developed with largely the same technical principles.
In the current discussion are the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of a recurrence, which make a corresponding metaphylaxis further meaningful.
While the side effects are known and can be calculated, comparative studies on the use of ESWL alongside other forms of therapy are still lacking.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), isolated acute corneal calcifications have been clinically observed.
The hitherto unknown pathomechanism prompted us to carry out the following investigations.
The coexistence of a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and an active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case report, we present the symptoms, diagnostics and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
various possibilities are discussed.
The ABO blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction method developed by Lee and Chang [6].
By using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, visualized on a polyacrylamide gel using silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwestern German population group:
allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 of 280 persons examined (3.57%), the examination method chosen here, which only takes nucleotide positions 261 and 703 into account, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since there was no differentiation between the A and 02 allele is possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic clarification.
The following casuistry is intended to show that exceptions must apply.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral facet of the patella after a soccer game.
Arthroscopically, it was a firm, nodular, fibrous-transformed hematoma that easily cleared with a hollow :
Hemorrhage from a bruise or subluxation of the patella had evidently occurred during the football game.
The boy was symptom-free after the arthroscopy, the muscular atrophy regressed quickly.
Two-thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented suggesting a longer-term effect (greater than a year).
Recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammatory from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insight into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are only loosely connected through the underlying causes of RA, but to some extent develop independently.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids may be related to different mechanisms presented elsewhere in this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenic cells express - and - chains of the 1-, 3- and 4-integrins and their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and inter-individual variation as well as different localizations on the sperm surface.
The nested polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day it is unclear whether the AM have functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or only represent "biological redundancy" or only the very last binding safeguard (final insurance).
Sperm AM labeling was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of -adrenergic receptors and has a diverse range of effects.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an increase in the evening and a night-time peak between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
In addition, due to its strong lipophilic properties, melatonin has the ability, independently of a receptor system, to diffuse freely through cell membranes and to act as a radical scavenger in the extra- and intracellular space.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the development of UV erythema.
There is some knowledge about the penetration properties through the skin and the oral availability, which can be supplemented by further investigations of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medical diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which can localize an inflammatory focus if the focus is unclear, since whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT technology are possible, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which e.g. B. enable the proof of a leukocyte infiltration.
Both approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus more precisely or which result in an inflammatory scintigraphy if the findings are unclear.
background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been an established method for treating capillary hemangiomas in infants.
Surprisingly, however, there are still no detailed studies that prove its effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The patient's prognosis depends on both the primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to intracranial masses due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema formation, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated TBI and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "system reaction" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multiple organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but can be fatal in their combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic states after TBI are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of TBI on the rest of the organism must be contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries to a polytraumatized patient on brain function, with shock-related perfusion disorders causing prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood coagulation, metabolism, and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the therapeutic measures currently used, are still insufficient and require further clarification.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right point in time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve to preserve life and lead to additional stress on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This thesis tries to summarize important aspects in this field.
The molecular forms of PSA and recently also human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids for better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma, but also for early detection of prostate carcinoma.
Children with facial clefts have an increased risk of developing another malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared to 599 completers and examined with regard to conspicuous personality traits.
Furthermore, they were asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for the termination.
An early childhood manifest, dominant hereditary dermatosis with partially circinar scaly erythema has been described as erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin, particularly in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal connection to the winter months and the characteristic histologically multiform findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological, and initial immunohistological findings in a 4-year-old patient that are consistent with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), arthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for their results and their scientific quality.
The vast majority of the works reviewed reveal clear deficiencies.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether the visual acuity decreases as a function of the performance time and whether normal persons and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the assessment of fitness to drive.
Sudeck's syndrome affects a limb after microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck's syndrome were caused by an excessive inflammatory response to injury or surgery to a limb.
His theory found no support because most of the medical community believes that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system.
We carried out various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, methods for applying fast multislice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
In addition to the radiological examination methods commonly used in dentistry, computed tomography enables an overlay-free display of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use in other questions has proven itself.
If the examination is carried out with a slice thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of impacted teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the impacted teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the impacted tooth can be defined, an orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone loss must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic masses can be detected with CT.
Before an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by carefully considering the remaining bone substance and the position of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
The symptoms of SE are described using case studies.
The main symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to coma.
The cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, a generalized cerebral edema can occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products and bacteremia itself are important etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in the amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte imbalances, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, and hepatic and renal failure may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate treatment of sepsis is of decisive prognostic importance, SE as a possible initial symptom of sepsis is of particular diagnostic importance.
Despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy, endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis.
Films tell stories.
The scenes in which people are confronted with conflicting decisions are particularly exciting.
Medical-ethical conflicts not only appear in doctor series or depictions of diseases, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
comedies, westerns, romance, gangster and crime films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time are seismographs for the social relevance of medical-ethical topics.
However, in film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical-ethical case study and is a helpful supplement for teaching analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the restenosis rate compared to conventional PTCA means that stent implantation has become the intervention most frequently performed initially.
Therefore, in-stent restenosis - especially the long-distance form - represents a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stenting and initial angioplasty on these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The prehospital management of amputation injuries places great demands on the rescue service.
It is precisely the initial care of the amputate in the case of amputation injuries, in addition to the initial care of the injured person, that often decides on the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of imaging diagnostics of the larynx is the analysis of the submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
As a result, the general rule is to carry out imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical relationships of the skeleton, the internal structures and the area around the larynx will be presented synoptically.
The instability was eliminated with segmental function preservation by transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system.
In recent years, new insights into post-traumatic changes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships have been gained.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals that are intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
Within the scope of this work, the more recent findings on pathophysiological changes after TBI and the basic pharmacological intervention options are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are at various stages of experimental and clinical testing.
background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease pose a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present work was to examine the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease in melanoma patients who had been completely treated.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking prophylactic minocycline for more than 3 years for pulmonary silicosis before symptomless blackish spots appeared on his face.
The other patient developed gray-black spots on both lower legs for folliculitis after only 6 months of taking minocycline.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser led to a regression of the pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed using case studies.
Aim of the operation Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
In recent years, microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
The recovery of neural abilities is an essential factor.
In the context of this study, the sensory regenerative ability of the N. alveolaris inferior after partial tumor surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascularized N. thoracicus longus was examined.
Pressure and pain could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The long thoracic nerve with a vascular pedicle thus represents a suitable nerve transplant for bridging defects of the inferior alveolar nerve caused by resection in tumor patients.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) ingestion is the documented leading cause of deliberate overdose of the drug in the United States and United Kingdom, yet a relatively small number of large numbers of overdoses result in serious ones complications.
Severe liver toxicity is to be expected in any patient in whom the standard dose has been exceeded and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, any patient in whom the severity or timing of the overdose is unknown should undergo complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function deteriorates.
At the onset of signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in the event of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has remarkably improved the fate of a hitherto incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the liver disease special facilities.
background and question.
Itching is a side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases that is difficult to treat.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid found in the pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
When applied topically after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers and thereby selectively suppresses itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a diagnostically and therapeutically problematic urological clinical picture.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as an operative alternative in therapy-refractory testalgia.
After adequate environmental diagnostics, 12 patients were treated surgically with spermatic cord neurolysis:
The M. cremastericus is severed using bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of the A. testicularis is detached under microsurgical conditions over a length of 2-3 cm.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is precise, so that a precise diagnosis of the surroundings is essential to rule out a specific genesis of the testalgia.
In neurosurgery, too, there is a trend towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimize the preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to keep the risk of neurological and psychological disorders as low as possible.
The hospital stay and the inability to work can often be shortened.
The essential "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, brain chambers and subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic intervention is obstructive hydrocephalus.
However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular masses can also be effectively treated endoscopically via a small drill hole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, such as cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome as well as adjuvant to microsurgical operations.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral metastases and in MR-morphologically normal vertebral bodies.
DW-MRT measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
A low ADC is to be expected in cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (ie diffusion barriers), and a high ADC in cell-poor or necrotic tissue.
A 53-year-old man had a melanotic lung tumor that had completely occluded the left main bronchus and whose base was localized in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.
In the medical history there was no evidence of a previous removal of a skin, mucous membrane or eye change.
Examinations of the skin and eyes, which were carried out in a targeted manner, also gave no indication of a primary tumor localized there.
Thus, the neoplasm is to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases have been confirmed to date.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far, there is no experience with twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore examined twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has become established as a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnostics.
Identical pharmacological stress protocols as currently used in echocardiography can be performed with ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging.
Corneal HLA-DR antigens are lost during organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this is due to down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has developed into a diagnostic routine technique that is preferably used in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry because of its lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically flawless technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, in the 1st line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in the 2nd line also the ploidy, represent important prognostic and therapy planning factors.
Exact knowledge of the method and the possible errors is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be regarded as unclear at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multi-parametric investigations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
Injection therapy plays an important role in cervical syndromes.
This article deals with the general requirements on the one hand and the various practical procedures for injection on the other.
Summary It is unclear whether the costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV will be covered by statutory health insurance, although the question of whether private health insurance companies will cover the costs should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (Section 20 SGB V), preventive medical care (Section 23 SGB V) and health examinations (Section 25 SGB V) will not be considered as the legal basis for the assumption of costs.
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the standard financing of health insurance, as there are no corresponding recommendations from the federal committees.
It would be desirable if corresponding recommendations were adopted soon in order to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to assume costs according to the principles of the legal form of the so-called new examination and treatment methods can be considered.
However, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be specified and cleared of ambiguities with regard to indication and application.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, as there are still too many ambiguities from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage results in the loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present work investigates the importance of a prolonged corneal storage time for the success of a penetrating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experiences with 3-dimensional echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct 3-dimensional ultrasonographic transfontanelle studies and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-related side effect in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin for Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who developed heterotopic ossifications in 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffness after intensive therapy lasting a total of 105 days with 72 days of mechanical ventilation.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant in severe pulmonary hypertension.
Mobility was restored by resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the elbow on the same side as well as both hip joints.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur in particular after trauma, after spinal cord injuries, after TBI, in the case of intoxication and in a long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is not yet known, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then causes new bone formation.
Diagnosis is made with the help of imaging techniques.
Drug treatment using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both methods can be used prophylactically.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) in whom we used the argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that could not or only slightly be influenced by established treatment strategies.
After application of the argon laser, complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of the treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings indicate that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in PE-related discoid lesions.
In the context of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, this is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection using polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Reinfection in hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for the transplant is less favorable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study and the existing literature.
The treatment of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception are the rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative claim.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentry tachycardia of varying incidence, duration, and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of the tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in the tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the conduction system, and identifying additional paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Anomalies of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and concomitant cardiac diseases should be evaluated before the intervention using echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of the intervention with contrast imaging.
The results of catheter ablation are presented in 300 patients with different variants of the pre-excitation syndrome.
A standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary in order to achieve a qualitatively better recording of the occurrence of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over the years.
Since January 1st, 1997, the Foundation Orthopedic University Clinic Heidelberg has kept a complete, consented register of all early complications of all inpatients.
The complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature, and the information is checked, corrected, supplemented and classified by the quality management department of the clinic.
The guide is intended to contribute to the discussion about a standard for recording and evaluating complications in orthopedics with the aim of building a consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the acral region in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, an impairment of the dermoepidermal coherence, which inevitably occurs during the course of treatment, is probably the underlying cause, which becomes clinically manifest in the form of bulging blisters due to mechanical stress.
Acrobullous photodermatosis must be differentiated from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of excessive UVA radiation or excessive psoralen concentrations.
The clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture are presented on the basis of two cases.
Apart from autopsy confirmed findings of a fibrolipomatous replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological features, which have been divided into major and minor criteria.
On the basis of the following investigation on a collective of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the criteria developed is to be checked.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in the sense of the main criteria could be demonstrated in 20 patients (83%) by means of angiography or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) showed only secondary criteria in the radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of the right ventricular myocardium could be detected histologically.
T-inversions in right precordial leads as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS widening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 could be found in 8 patients (33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis using signal averaging ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of secondary criteria.
Left bundle branch block-like ventricular tachycardias, which were classified as secondary criteria, could be detected in 23 patients (96%);
only one patient died of progressive right heart failure without any evidence of arrhythmia.
A medical history of an unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as an additional criterion was recorded in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the value of a secure histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without including histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favorable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more possible.
Evidence shows that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia on cerebral ischemia is controversial.
The conflicting results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained if different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood glucose levels during the acute event is considered.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia when there is insufficient collateral supply.
Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, when there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow, acute blood glucose elevation can protect nerve tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply.
This situation occurs in the area of the penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative as well as the positive effects of acute hyperglycaemia depend on the local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgery diagnosis, according to which resective epilepsy surgery was performed in 50 of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies.
The localized agreement of findings from non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal SPECT (single photon emission computer tomography) formed the Basis of focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or only had seizures very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG studies if there were circumscribed MRI lesions and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, especially temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG recordings are sufficient in the presurgical diagnostics and the risk of invasive EEG examinations can thus be avoided.
History and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented to an external clinic with a new onset of absolute tachyarrhythmia.
The suspicion of an intracardiac mass was initially expressed by echocardiography, which was to be further clarified by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
The ECG showed absolute tachyarrhythmia with frequencies up to 146/min, and intermittent sinus rhythm was also documented.
This could also be confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large mass projecting onto the posterior mediastinum, projecting laterally beyond the right mediastinal edge.
Due to the suppressive growth of the cyst with the triggering of atrial arrhythmias and to safely rule out malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by means of an anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in sinus rhythm and only complains of isolated "dropouts", most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Atrial arrhythmias that appear primarily harmless can also be based on rare causes such as thoracic, extracardiac or intracardiac masses that require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cranial nerve palsy can have a variety of causes.
A rare trigger for a paresis of one or multiple cranial nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
Early detection of a carotid dissection, even if the symptoms are atypical, is important, since anticoagulant therapy started in good time can prevent a stroke as a result of a dissection-related embolism.
We report on 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder syndrome) and the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that every painful, sudden cranial nerve failure must also suggest a carotid dissection.
The wrong exit of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic into old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child and the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis was made by chance during echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of transplanting the defective coronary artery without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases because of the coronary artery steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures involving the joint (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joint offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result with a small amount of soft tissue trauma caused by the operation.
The aim is to at least achieve exercise stability, also in comparison with the standard methods.
In addition to the minimal surgical soft-tissue trauma, arthroscopy offers the precise intraoperative assessment of the articular surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries compared to conventional methods.
In the period from September 1993 to January 1998, arthroscopically supported osteosynthesis could be carried out in our clinic in 34 of a total of 54 patients with tibia head fractures.
The follow-up examination of a total of 17 patients showed good results according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a selected group of patients, we consider arthroscopically supported, minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable even for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who developed a bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy without other neurological deficits after a moderately severe craniocerebral trauma, which clinically regressed completely within 3 months.
Since computed tomography did not show a skull base fracture in the area of the posterior fossa, we discuss a bilateral hypoglossal nerve strain as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency describes a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of everyday life.
The back pressure propagates from the large veins via the smallest venules to the microcirculation area and finally affects the metabolism of the tissue.
Typical clinical features that can be secondarily confirmed with a simple objective measurement method are the best basis for classification principles.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as angiodermatitis developing at the bottom of arteriovenous shunts.
In the area of the lower extremities, mostly unilateral skin changes occur, which are reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and, rarely, hypertrophy of the affected extremity.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerating nodules with a tendency to bleed and become infected.
The causal therapy consists of removing the arteriovenous shunts.
A surgical approach is rarely feasible because of the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
It is reported on the successful embolization treatment, which has been carried out a total of 8 times, in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.
Until now, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytosis of the skin was based not only on the clinical picture and histology on the H&E section, but also on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on the frozen section (CD1a).
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-penetrating markers now also enable (also retrospective) processing and precise classification of these diseases on formalin-fixed material.
Antibodies against the S-100 protein and the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) can be used to distinguish the classic cells of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LZH) from other histiocytic cell systems.
To date, there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics in the so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LZH).
The infiltrates consist of multiple cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (monocyte/macrophage and dendritic cell subtypes).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-permeable immunohistological markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (exemplified in xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (exemplified in juvenile xanthogranuloma) seem to have diagnostic significance with regard to differentiation from Langerhans cell histiocytoses.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epitheloid cells typical of the disease process.
In the following we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of application of allopurinol and after re-exposure to this drug.
Verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had suffered from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
To date, 7 case reports of non-schistosomiasis-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma seems to lie in chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After all conservative treatment options had been exhausted, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological stains and accepted immunohistological stains, especially for tumor diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these investigations, which were carried out independently at 3 different institutions, it could be determined that tissue samples fixed with NoToX show no differences whatsoever in relation to the reproducibility of conventional staining or the visualization of immunohistochemical reactions compared to tissue samples fixed with formalin.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
Dose parameters such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the "multiple scan average dose" (MSAD) and the axis dose free in air are usually used to describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography.
The CTDI and the MSAD, which can be derived from it, are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses that are relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose to estimate risk.
The specification of an upper reference value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirement of the examination region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities can be used to characterize and differentiate different examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
Following a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) task force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been added to this definition.
Consequently, a number of infectious agents such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses appear to be important pathogenetic factors involved in the development of inflammatory myocardial disease and ventricular dilatation.
It makes sense to give shame as a general human emotion its own place, separate from guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self"-preserving function of shame should also be taken into account.
The occurrence of shame always points to the protection of the sense of worth, even if it is not currently recognizable in the patient.
The signaling nature of shame is discussed and the question of whether symptoms of shame have disease value is considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review article provides an overview of the literature on the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very inhomogeneous in terms of understanding of the crisis and therapy methods as well as in terms of professional responsibility.
General treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, young people and adolescents from the last 10 years are described in detail.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without an inflammatory reaction and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Atherosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined by immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy.
The aims of this study were the evaluation of possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, the detection and quantification of cell death events, and the differentiation of apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on corpses specially fixed - according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - it was examined in which position the transverse fascia is in relation to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In the case of TEP, the fascia can at best be used laterally to the artery to reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment for fixing foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients, aged 50 and 84 years, who presented with severe, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scale crusts provided the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
It is assumed that the long-lasting therapy of the eczema in the sense of an immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are being evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions in terms of O2 transport and in particular effective O2 delivery to the tissues has been proven in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically usable intravascular half-life of approx. 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
A certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Despite this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative from the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured people.
An introduction is to be expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally recognized indications for HBOT therapy in which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapy component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, the possibility of oxygen intoxication in the central nervous system must be taken into account.
The clinical use of HBOT therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical determination of the indication as well as the skills and abilities to safely control any complications with intensive care or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthetist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this work the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique in sonically accessible tumors because of its good depth focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that nuclear spin tomography is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive MRI temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be evaluated in carefully designed clinical trials.
The long-term effects of prematurity on the ophthalmological and ENT status were to be demonstrated in a group of extremely small premature babies.
At the orthopedic university hospital in Homburg/Saar, an IT system has been in use since 1993 for OP and outpatient documentation and to support the general organization of the hospital.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-supported coding of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the data of 31,500 patients have been entered into the system and 8,500 operations have been documented.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical sector and those of administration can be taken into account.
Another hospital-wide network at the University Hospital Homburg also offers the possibility of cross-departmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks and the Internet.
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey of German epilepsy centers about the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to examine whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
Reference is also made to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of the (mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
In this study on sheep, it should be clarified whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether there is a chronological assignment and whether the results provide an indication for the use of GAG as a prognostic method Criterion or osteoarthritis marker can accept.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each:
Knee joints from the contralateral side and knee joints from animals from other approved projects (n=54) serve as controls.
The radiological score values between the groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significantly (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, the HA in the groups ME and MV shows a significantly increased value.
In the case of CS, there is a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) both for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial transection.
Clinical Consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - a possible, to a certain extent, description of the degree of arthrosis.
The concentration increases with longer postoperative intervals and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
Therapy with blockers is the standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
If the therapy fails, a pacemaker implantation or an operative sympathetic blockade can be considered as an option.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
Additions and the use of an epidiascope are described, which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organs or organ slices in general and special pathology courses and saves the need for complex video installations with additional lighting etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in old age and of far-reaching importance.
These problems are related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego ideal in old age.
Pathological exacerbations of the aging process, which are often present in older patients, are shown in three aspects.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transference in these patients are described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of older patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal problems are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the muscle energy technique.
The therapy is very successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to impulse chiropractic techniques.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint pain, recurrent diarrhea and sicca symptoms.
The clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of the duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in the diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
To our knowledge, a joint occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not been described so far.
The initiation of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in the clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological clinical pictures.
In developed countries, medical conditions rather than nutritional deficiencies contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the elderly population, occurring in 5-12% of the independently living, 30-61% of the hospitalized and 40-85% of the elderly living in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial character of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A physician's heightened awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of undernutrition.
The light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
digitiform radial extensions, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots on a blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific reflected-light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on a combination of several individual features that are suspicious of malignancy.
The article provides a general overview of the current development status of gene therapy methods in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently used vectorial transport systems and strategies for the integration of therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapy concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical feasibility studies in which such a gene (IRAP) was transferred are a major step forward on the way to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experiences with unidirectional and bidirectional distractors both in the intra- and extraoral application in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic clinical pictures.
These were 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Nager syndrome, and 1 rare case of midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm being achieved.
Older people who are interested in further training are increasingly recognizing the wide range of opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and institutions for the education of the elderly are required to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media skills and to design interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on experiences from the "Senior-Info-Mobile" information campaign, possibilities are described to give people over 50 access to the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects, it is further shown how spatially and temporally decoupled "research-based learning" by older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a "new learning culture", which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who cannot take part in local offers for health or other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods in recent years.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of the simultaneous acquisition of morphological and functional parameters using a non-invasive method without exposure to radiation.
Because of its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that offers insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR heart diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic method that offers the complete clarification of heart diseases in one examination, both as an initial examination and as a follow-up check.
Due to the rapidly advancing development, existing limitations, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be resolved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and IT at the Orthopedic University Clinic in Heidelberg is given.
Since it was founded in 1967, four development phases can be distinguished:
First medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of performance.
Planning and realization were carried out taking into account the framework plans and concepts of the university hospitals of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
We report the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac massage.
This is the first published case.
We report on a bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with subsequent septic embolization, ipsilateral knee empyema and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium.
Contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus must be assumed to be the cause.
Treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vessel section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with Type II unilateral split foot with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current status of the controversy surrounding the indication for back surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the field of experiments and biomechanics is described, as well as design features of the various types of implants and special features of the patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patella rear surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for a posterior surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the posterior surface of the patella could be formulated.
The biomechanical reasons for the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint prostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overloading of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is frequently observed after organ transplantation in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensiogenic drugs cyclosporine A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
There are hardly any studies on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" denotes the absence of visible signs of fracture in the conventional radiography performed for the initial diagnosis when the fracture is nevertheless present.
The diagnosis can only be made in the course of the disease or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations carried out for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is a method that allows both the early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and the diagnosis of any accompanying chondral and ligamentous injuries.
In the present study, we report on 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, in whom the diagnosis could be made with negative X-ray findings using MRI.
The athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon that was described early on.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta because of the highly variable clinical picture and the fact that it can only be diagnosed invasively or postmortem.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient-year.
Pathological studies have consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial emboli.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is a cause of embolic complications during surgical interventions or catheterization of the aorta.
Anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta, with pedunculated and motile thrombi arising from circumscribed plaques.
Embolic recurrences could be prevented and a regression of the thrombi observed.
We report on a 62-year-old patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and restricted extension of the right knee joint as a result of a comminuted supracondylar femoral fracture, who had been osteosynthetically treated 2 years ago using a dynamic condylar screw.
Here the indication for a varius and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis using a retrograde femoral nail was made.
Within the first postoperative week, the patient was able to bear full weight on her right lower extremity with the axis being compensated.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method to achieve good and load-resistant osteosynthesis even during corrective operations.
Lacrimal duct surgeries at the University Eye Clinic in Münster on 296 children between 1987 and 1992 were examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspect, but do not in themselves prove carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nucleus size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasm changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically evaluated in any case and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (if basal cells are positively detected) rule it out with certainty.
In this review, the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, a maintenance therapy of 14 days 20 mg TNFR55-IgG1 iv was compared with a monthly administration of 50 mg.
The 60 patients in this study had previously received an initial dose of 100 mg.
In all three studies, patients who were treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all parameters measured just one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, despite further administration of the test substance, there was an increase in the inflammatory parameters.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies could be detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient is reported who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
Healthy newborns are also entitled to optimal care so that any disruption in postnatal adaptation is recognized in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all those responsible.
background and question.
In view of increasing reports of increases in resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aqua jogging is a technique that has been used in sports and rehabilitation for years, in which jogging-like movements are carried out in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aqua jogging is used as regeneration training and as "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and post-operative phase for diseases of the musculoskeletal system, and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical therapy options for erectile dysfunction are of a vascular surgical or prosthetic nature.
According to the current status of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy in a selected group of patients.
The most important criteria are age below 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
Contrary to the initial short-term successes, the long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to approx. 53-55%.
Vein surgery has lost its status due to a drastic loss of long-term success (less than 40% on average).
Penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term implant survival rates and patient satisfaction of 89%.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the intervention often forces this therapy option to take last place in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications can occur such as cylinder defects and perforations with a 5-year survival rate of the implants between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by a penetrating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal transplants, which, however, are highly immunogenic.
We report on our 3 years of experience with the homologous central limbokeratoplasty method we have developed.
Pentosan polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly reduces the frequency of nocturia, while the frequency of micturition during the day remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also lowered the frequency of nocturia in an open prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are practically free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of radiological information web sites have sprung up and are now available online, competing with commercial offerings.
After the first experiences, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal responses of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
In the following, we report two cases from a psychiatric and forensic point of view, in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID and accused themselves of having killed their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are given.
Review of the cases of 110 children admitted with Burkitt's lymphoma over a 7-year period at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, showed a preponderance of male over female patients (1.9 :
1) and a peak age of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is believed that an interaction between malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumour.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective at inducing disease regression but is better than either agent at preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of the patients revealed a good survival rate.
Since it was built by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau clinic has been a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer preserved, continued and complemented Braun's life's work.
Important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures emanated from Zwickau surgery.
After a brief overview of the literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the background of early fears of abandonment, there is a renewed threat of being abandoned within the framework of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which previously served to regulate diffuse inner tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic dermatitis is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, can cause pustular dermatitis as an undesirable effect, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after application of a dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation that was incorrectly concentrated 50 times too high in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance because, as a secondary form of hypertension, it can in many cases be successfully treated and in some cases cured by interventional radiological or vascular surgery measures.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
An andrological patient is reported, in whom the initial examination revealed a high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicle size, which was significantly below the normal range, indicated pronounced testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the smear of semen can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery phase under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E and the trace element zinc, there was a clear improvement in the spermiogram.
After a further 2 months, a pregnancy with subsequent birth of a healthy daughter could be achieved by intrauterine insemination.
At this point in time, only mild teratozoospermia was found in the patient.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of a central serous chorioretinopathy with systemic therapy with corticosteroids will be described.
The X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy alongside sonography.
The toddler's legs should be kept in a central position.
Side turns and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
A look back at 150 years, of which 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which last developed back into the 19th century in the "open approach" with opening the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
a sublabial approach for septorhinoplasty in the sense of a minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the diagnostic imaging of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest X-ray is the top priority.
In-depth knowledge of the normal chest image and the possible physiological peripartum changes are a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatal chest radiograph.
Childish pathologies:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes that radiologists face in neonatology are unknown in radiodiagnostics of adult patients.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect their quality of life later in life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here an overview of the most important pathologies that the radiologist can face in the daily routine is given.
The primary tumors were breast carcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcomas (n = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanomas (n = 9), gastric carcinomas (n = 9), Bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (each n = 6) and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor involvement (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, and in 51% (n = 61) of the 120 primary resections an extrahepatic tumor was present.
Of the 120 primary resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1, and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
The median overall survival was 20 months after the first resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After a second resection (n = 14), the median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients with no extrahepatic tumor at the time of primary liver resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The present results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases certainly promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrence may even benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term courses could be observed even with a rather unfavorable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be checked in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained at a loss regarding the act, which was alien to his personality and for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in detention, he suffered a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.
For the assessment of culpability, this course in connection with the attested behavioral problems shortly before the crime allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be considered.
It could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of later SAH.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself, among other things, for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) that has been dislocated into the vitreous body.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is bloated and can be repositioned in the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be e.g. B. can be refixed in the Sulcus ciliaris.
What kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Since the PFCL is likely to be biotoxic if it remains intraocularly for a longer period of time, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of the operation.
A rare case of a solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of a chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year symptom-free postoperative interval.
Within the framework of further investigations, no clinically detectable metastases were found.
However, considering the cases described so far, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental anomalies of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by a malfusion (pancreas divisum) or a malrotation (pancreas annulare) of the two systems.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas annulare can ultimately only be secured by imaging the pancreatic duct.
In the case of congenital diseases, there are genetic defects in which other organ systems are usually also affected and in which the extrapancreatic damage is usually the main symptom of the disease.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected using modern imaging methods.
Books often do not only contain the material written by the author.
Based on the tables by Bärensprung and Hebra, it is shown that, at second glance, they also reveal some other medical-historically relevant facts.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary pectus excavation and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The informative value of sonography in bacterial coxitis was checked.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined sonographically.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the surface of the femoral head and the periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard cutting planes of the DEGUM.
An intraarticular mass (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule detachment was demonstrated sonographically in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and in the early stages of Perthes' disease.
Since the joint capsule distension does not show any significant differences in the individual diseases, it is not possible to differentiate between these diseases on the basis of the sonogram if there is capsule distension without bony changes.
Bacterial coxitis cannot be reliably distinguished from coxitis of other origins sonographically;
Capsular distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
If there is a clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, an immediate diagnostic puncture, possibly under sonographic control, is required.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to the capsular distention, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes' disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be distinguished sonographically from bacterial coxitis and coxitis of other origins.
The diagnosis of the rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in the context of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since both cases of gliomatosis cerebri contained tumor cells that were unusually highly dedifferentiated, the diagnosis was made more difficult by atypical findings such as contrast medium uptake in the MRI and clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are presented briefly.
Various experimental designs such as cohort studies, case-control studies and randomized clinical studies are presented and explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to make statements about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements of clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but that good clinical research in this sense depends primarily on careful study planning.
A possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has so far been evaluated differently.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost completely ignored in studies.
The present retrospective study was carried out under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From April 1, 1996 to June 30, 1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerotic, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenoses were treated by means of transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, a thrombendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with profundaplasty was performed in one case, and angioplasty with stent implantation of the common iliac artery in another case.
Technical and clinical success was achieved in all cases.
In an observation period of median 23 (7-33) months, there was no occlusion or clinical restenosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a less invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary A patient is reported who underwent several years of infertility treatment and became pregnant although she actually did not want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous as pathogens.
In the past, Aspergillus flavus was classified as rather non-pathogenic for humans.
The case of a 72-year-old patient is described in whom Aspergillus flavus was cultured in the tracheal secretion after an aortocoronary bypass operation in the intensive care unit.
The performed serological test methods, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
is "monoclonal-antibody" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) latex particles coated with monoclonal-antibodies were multiple negative.
A post-mortem Aspergillus test using a newer method, antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
Clinical and radiographic findings showed no evidence of systemic infection.
The patient died before antimycotic therapy was started. The autopsy showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of a more sensitive antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
With the correct assessment of the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even if Aspergillus flavus is cultured once in the trachea.
The epidemiological data show a decline in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in industrialized countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforation is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - and the high perforation rate in small children and old people shows the low diagnostic certainty.
Analysis of the epidemiological data does not allow any clear conclusions to be drawn about the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
After refractive surgery on the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular image errors (aberrations) can occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
Recording these aberrations under clinical conditions would be an important first step towards documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile stress tests had previously been carried out experimentally.
Ecke and Hofmann came to the conclusion that comparable stability can be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that this should be preferred because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis to prevent its ankylosing.
Symphysis stabilization using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension bands and PDS bandings were tested in a comparative manner by means of simultaneous, multidirectional dynamic experimental investigations under gait simulation conditions.
The symphysis specimens were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire harness nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, although these methods allowed a symphysis mobility that exceeded the physiological limits immediately after the start of the test.
In the further course of the test, the instability increased as a result of the cerclages and bandings cutting into the bone or the wire cerclages breaking, generally to the point of complete failure.
In contrast, in the TLC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
In the primary tendency of the screws to overtighten, plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic loading.
With primarily stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained completely stable over 55,500 load changes with a load corresponding to an average of half the body weight.
From these results it can be deduced for clinical application that neither the bridging tension belt with wire cerclages nor the PDS banding sufficiently stabilize the ruptured pubic symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial weight bearing.
If the TLC plate or the reconstruction plate can primarily be used to safely stabilize the ruptured symphysis by anchoring the screws well in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with an "open-book injury" can be mobilized with a partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted for years with good success.
Due to the distribution of light over several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or stray light effects caused by capsular fibrosis may lead to a deterioration in vision at an early stage.
A 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumor in a 69-year-old woman was initially misjudged as a primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
A duodenal leiomyosarcoma measuring 7 cm in diameter was only discovered during an anemia investigation carried out 17 months later and was resected by means of a duodenopancreatectomy.
The reassessment of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as a metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later from an apoplectic stroke.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by the thyroid metastasis.
Drug therapy for erectile dysfunction includes oral and local application of pharmaceuticals.
The only approved oral substance with proven effectiveness at this point in time is yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha-receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with a central target are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine being significantly better than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, has also shown encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both the intraurethral (MUSE) and the intracavernosal application are available for local application.
At the present time, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely replaced other pharmaceuticals as the substance used.
There are currently several promising substances with a wide variety of effects and different dosage forms in development as a therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, working with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient's state of consciousness and contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be reached sufficiently by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural reach.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy led to the establishment of a large number of different strategies that are summarized under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients experience a temporary stabilization of the disease, which in some cases can last for years.
These are mostly the results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not to be expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient collectives.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for patients treated with immunotherapy compared to those who are not or have not received chemotherapy.
A survival advantage for patients with objective remissions is assured.
A standard therapy cannot currently be defined.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of the current therapy protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in the currently achievable remission rates and the survival advantage for immunotreated patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma .
The application should usually take place in the context of clinical studies.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half each 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old) and 239 women (half each 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
The index calculation includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between the laboratory indices and the biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the epiploic appendix of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as an incidental finding during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous ovarian tumors and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the epiploic appendages and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings may be due to occult peritoneal endosalpingioses.
The histogenesis, histology and localization of primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon transplant, this procedure was initially expected to have advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopically and 14 openly operated patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The score systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligament stability (KT-1000), the duration of the operation and the proprioception using the angular reproduction test were recorded.
The absorbed dose of the spiral computed tomography and the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the manufacturer of the computer tomograph for a dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved with no loss of diagnostic information.
The measured absorbed dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid gland) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm slices (25 mm scan length in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by about 76% had no influence on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of an enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified with the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium in patients with a clinically suspected diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy enables a subdivision into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the 1995 WHO classification (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected using histological and especially immunohistological techniques.
Only by combining histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques was it possible to carry out a subgroup analysis with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to the bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative) bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis can be distinguished, which, in contrast to the others, manifests itself primarily on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicle osteomyelitis that we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case reports.
Despite its rare occurrence, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered in the differential diagnosis, since it is a domain of conservative, drug therapy after biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors is based on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Based on a literature analysis, the work examines the role of the total treatment duration and the dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the hypotheses derived from them and, above all, well-designed clinical studies can enable progress in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative agent, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to decreased proliferation, migration, and signaling.
In this work, the in-vitro and in-vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in-vivo use.
The effect of paclitaxel in the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall was demonstrated by means of staining of the cytoskeleton and electron optics.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and enlargement of the vessel diameter compared to balloon-dilated controls.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in the vascular contractile force after administration of paclitaxel could be shown.
In addition to an age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplasm and basement membrane of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), a splitting of Bruch's membrane between the basement membrane of the RPE cells can be seen in various manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularization and pigment epithelial detachment -Cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus could be detected.
Recent investigations make it clear that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis arise as a result of disturbed spinal column growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the location of the lesion and the type of tendon affection in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of the hand function through improved clinical diagnostics.
For the majority of common dermatoses, there are no suitable animal models that occur in nature.
The transgenic technology established in the 1980s closes this gap.
It was initially an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented, specifically dermatological basic research.
It made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases and genodermatoses in the murine model and gain insight into their pathogenesis.
Targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities with psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
Furthermore, transgenic technology enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The existence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows the targeted research of experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic questions such as processes in the posterior fossa, spinal abscesses and complaints inside the knee can be examined better with MRI than with other radiological methods.
MRI can directly affect wearers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and displacement of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electrical currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in patients with artificial heart valves does not appear to be sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five prosthetic heart valve manufacturers regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their prosthetic valve.
Some companies based their statements on investigations that could not be seen, or blamed the doctor performing the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain prosthesis types.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, the clinical circumstances and the requirements for MRI safety standards for people with artificial heart valves is given.
In an experimental study, an intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after bolus administration of 20 and 30 ml.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of a 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), none of the animals died and no resuscitation was required.
Poorly soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations where there is an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma annulare and a known diabetic metabolic condition.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We carried out balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole-body baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin condition on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Balneophotochemotherapy can therapeutically influence not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (CKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
The pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was only isolated a few years ago.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Other organ manifestations are less common.
We report on a 47-year-old woman who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the medium and large joints, and inflammatory lumbago after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were temporary and responded well to NSAIDs.
To date, only a few cases of joint involvement in CCC have been described.
However, since the prevalence of Bartonella henselae in cats is high in Europe, it may be a more common cause of joint problems than previously thought.
The diagnosis of KKK has been made easier in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
The prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved significantly as a result of continuous optimization of therapy in recent years.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications that the treating physician must be aware of.
The often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency have a lasting impact on the quality of life of the mostly young patients.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia after primarily successful therapy represents a significant problem.
Based on attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990) the aim was to operationalize these patterns appropriately in the sense of their original definition, ie as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "safe", "avoidant" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Three scales were formed on the basis of factor analysis results:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as attachment styles:
"secure", two variants of "uncertain-ambivalent" ("closed" and "clinging") and two variants of "uncertain-avoidant" ("closed" and "cooperative").
Discriminant analysis of these clusters resulted in discriminant functions similar to those of Collins and Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and simultaneous radiological evidence of a contrast medium-enhancing mass of the inner auditory canal strengthen the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case report shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellopontine angle, which manifested itself with a peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of a lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial paralysis that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings, as in the case we have described, must challenge us to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification, despite the presence of key symptoms.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellopontine angle is considered a rarity.
Balneotherapy and physiotherapy are further treatment options available to gynecologists in practices, clinics and in rehabilitation as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynaecology as a naturopathic treatment has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
Balneogynaecological and physiotherapeutic measures are to be used, based on the indication, primarily as supplementary measures.
They are only suitable as primary measures for reducing pain and positively influencing tissue in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture is available and subsequent susceptibility testing.
It takes seven to eight weeks to report a negative culture result.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps using new methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The worldwide worrying epidemiological situation of the infection risk for tuberculosis leaves no doubt that the further development of methods is necessary which allow mycobacteria to be detected with high sensitivity and specificity in the shortest possible time, to be differentiated and to be tested for their sensitivity to antibiotics.
In a prospective randomized study, non-joint bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the treatment of distal radius fractures (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster of paris.
The collection of donated breast milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is ruled out.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who themselves have premature babies is preferred for very premature babies.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day-care centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have emerged as complementary day-care facilities in Germany.
The wide distribution of these establishments contrasts with the widespread lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on the way they work.
In the present work, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, the psychopathological symptoms and the perspective of the visitors were recorded.
Almost all of the visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with an average moderate severity.
Two thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
The visitors mentioned the contact with other people and the daily structuring as positive aspects of the facilities.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance from other visitors.
On average, TSn attendees were younger and had higher scores on the BPRS subscale anergy.
Otherwise, the visitors of the two facilities hardly differed in the examined characteristics.
The results indicate that both institutions do in fact care for the chronically mentally ill with poor social integration, for whom they are also designed to care.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging sequences, information about tissue perfusion, microcirculation and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be obtained using special, e.g. T. models derived from nuclear medicine can be recorded.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be shown with diffusion-weighted MRI, the macrovascular system, resolved over time, with MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic examinations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be recorded multidimensionally and metabolic processes can be observed over the course of them.
The advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and any repeatability of the examination with no radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in relation to their value in comparison to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, the functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are able to sensitively record pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychoses.
It is a declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the countries of the European region, also in view of the constant political and economic change, to establish health protection as high as possible in the awareness of everyone.
Environmental factors that are harmful to health should be combated internationally through concrete measures or, better yet, avoided as a preventative measure.
An indispensable prerequisite is the agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health as well as mutually coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It must be ensured that governments and the respective population develop a common perception for the important environmental-medical problem areas.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) set up an office at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997 with the financial support of the Federal Ministry of Health "WHO Collaborating Center for Information and Communication on Environmental Health" established.
We report on a 30-year-old patient who developed right-sided amaurosis fugax with a simultaneous frontobasal fracture after a fall.
By means of CT and MR angiography, an occlusion of the A. ophthalmica as a result of a dissection of the A. carotis interna with ascending thrombosis could be proven as the cause.
There were no other neurological deficits, as adequate blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured via the Circulus arteriosus cerebri.
In the etiological variety of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
The suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification with suitable imaging methods such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, the suspicion of an aortic dissection was expressed by echocardiography in an asymptomatic patient.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other cross-sectional imaging methods to diagnose evidence of haustration of the aneurysmically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea and right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In the further clarification by means of echocardiography, a ruptured sinus Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary leaflet with left-right shunt into the right atrium could be determined non-invasively as the cause.
Cardiac surgery was uncomplicated with preservation of the aortic valve.
Six months later, the right heart sections were normal in echocardiography, and no shunt was detectable in color Doppler.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be the result of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
A precise diagnosis could be made non-invasively using echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography.
Characteristics of Nager syndrome are mandibulofacial and extremity malformations.
Hypoplasia of the mandible can lead to airway obstruction, especially in infancy, due to the tongue resting against the posterior wall of the pharynx.
We present a patient with Nager syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues had been pre-stretched by an extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed with a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic result are good.
Airway obstructions and dyspnea were no longer observed after the end of therapy.
Successful thromboendarterectomy (TEA) of the internal carotid artery leads to improved perfusion in the flow area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about the cerebral and ocular blood flow during the operation.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness using modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice is largely defined, but it is still unclear whether this independent medical service is adequately remunerated.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
Today there is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following we present a 38-year-old patient who had been suffering from progressive effluvium in psoriasis lesions on the scalp for years.
Histologically, there were cord-like fibrosis instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and signs of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and the lack of evidence for another cause of the scarring suggest a causal-pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important because consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably scarring.
Reduced growth hormone (GH) production is seen in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion may be due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent periods of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with consequent reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research points to the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classic neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone also effectively reduced SVV in the longer term.
With the present study, an osteoporosis animal model should be created by means of oophorectomy.
Before and after the ovariectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the maxilla and mandible were performed using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after oophorectomy was seen in both the upper and lower jaw.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were evaluated and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the bleeding were varied:
In addition to vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from eroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
The surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy brought good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by adders (Vipera berus).
The adder injects a venom composed of various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Adder bites in children can have few symptoms, but can also cause severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their surroundings can be displayed over a large area.
The transmission of the sonographic finding to the therapist who is not present during the examination and the control of a finding, eg a tumor, during therapy are considerably improved as a result.
In turn, viruses have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity around the world.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in ever shorter periods of time.
In this work, four case studies are used to examine the factors that can influence the early or late point in time of the initial diagnosis of dementia.
In all of our cases, we made the indication for surgery.
In each case, the perforation site was sutured and extensively rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the suture was additionally secured with fibrin glue or with an omentumplasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate sequelae.
Based on our own results and after evaluating the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified to us:
When securing a perforation in the early stages, a definitive surgical approach is indicated.
Even in the case of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high surgical risk.
The standards and regulations valid in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidney, Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more often.
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that only rarely have larger portions containing fatty tissue.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which radiologically could have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous portion with internal calcifications.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different cross-sectional imaging methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlate in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misdiagnosed as a malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in the differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
We report on a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history, bloody-purulent expectoration and significant body weight reduction, who was referred to us on suspicion of a thoracic sarcoma.
The diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could only be made via a diagnostic detour.
This was triggered by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms quickly regressed and ultimately led to the patient being cured.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of the differential diagnosis of thoracic masses, which include inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors and germ cell tumors.
Arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease).
In addition to local changes such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences such as hypercirculatory heart failure often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient is described in which percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy.
Instead, the adjustable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After a minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output could be successfully reduced and heart failure treated.
The technique described thus represents an alternative to ligature of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies of benign diseases in our own examination material in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis occurs in about 1% of the number of births today, the different forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently to be diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small part is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoid or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis occurring in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and when pathogen-related mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be carried out on fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs primarily in immunocompromised or antibiotic-treated patients.
We report on 2 boys, aged 5 and 14, respectively, with colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, without the above-mentioned preconditions or any specific underlying disease.
The weaning process, if not carefully managed, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of an appropriate protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily screening of respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable tools that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and ability to breathe spontaneously are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, since there is sufficient evidence that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after attempting spontaneous breathing.
A gradual cessation of mechanical ventilation may be attempted in patients in whom attempts at spontaneous breathing have been unsuccessful.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to stop mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate aims to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and the surgical outcome in 30 patients with unilateral LKG clefts.
Open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal grid photos and lateral cephalometric radiographs.
Deviations in nasal symmetry, nasal width and nasal alar line from the ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal line, and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurt horizontal line.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate air patency.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined and the nip and non-nip side flows were compared.
The examinations were carried out immediately before and 6 months after the surgical intervention.
In the frontal plane, there was a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nasal alar inclination.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofacial angle and the deep set nostrils was not achieved.
As a result of the intervention, the total flow could be increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows on the gap and non-gap side could be achieved.
The examination methods used allow the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings to be objectified and thus serve as quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual therapy of the spine from the years 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications that have occurred in connection with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft-tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably image normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, however, the synovial fluid that is necessary for an exact demarcation of the injured ligaments is often missing.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, since the intra-articular contrast agent application distends the joint space with improved differentiation of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in assessing the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions it is easier to visualize contrast medium flushing of the dissecate.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular loose bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
MR arthrography, although invasive, provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle and various ankle diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the state before the emergency occurred.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients who underwent resuscitation due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of varicose veins of the great and/or parva vein type.
Ascension can lead to a migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the orifices of the trunk veins in the groin and popliteal fossa or via insufficient perforating veins, with the risk of a complication of a pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the trunk veins without involvement of the tributaries of the great and/or small saphenous vein and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient perforating veins into the deep veins.
In these cases, the varicose veins are surgically repaired only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes crossectomy, extirpation of the saphenous vein through separate incisions, excision of all varicose branches, and ligation of insufficient perforating veins.
In type III, thrombectomy via the great and/or large saphenous vein has priority over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptom-free thickening of the lateral parts of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
Formally pathogenetically, the disease is based on a benign fibromatosis.
Based on my own observations and a review of the literature, exogenous factors in the form of compulsive behavior seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic uraemic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms are irritability, restlessness, confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological deficits.
We report on a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute organic brain psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness up to coma.
Initial cranial computed tomography revealed discrete, general brain swelling, which resolved independently of clinical deterioration.
The cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
Transcranial Doppler sonography showed generalized increases in flow velocity (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides and A. basilaris).
The causal connection between increases in flow velocity and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement took place analogously to the regression of the increases in flow velocity.
Pathophysiologically, a disturbed prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow-up of the anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although the gold standard for cruciate ligament repair is replacement surgery, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent option in adolescents.
We report the rare case of a post-traumatic brachiocephalic aneurysm.
This was preceded by a blunt chest trauma in a traffic accident.
The vascular injury could not be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt chest trauma, angiography must be requested if possible to rule out life-threatening vascular injuries.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes differ significantly from them.
This brief description of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a well-founded decision-making aid for his own practical work with regard to many everyday, but by no means insignificant problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma was treated with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgBWxmin over a gradual phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in the inflammatory parameters, the lung function, in particular the diffusion capacity and the pronounced acral circulatory disorders.
From a functional point of view, the elbow joint is the most important joint of the upper extremity due to its central location.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the region of the proximal forearm confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions in the elbow joint, which are associated with chronic pain symptoms and restricted movement, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today there is hardly any doubt that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with an exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, lead complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulations by the patient on subcutaneous electrode sections that can be felt through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode runs and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already used successfully in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
In the present review, the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil is presented and the current experience with this drug in dermatology is summarized.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility of tomographically precisely analyzing structures in individual steps.
Image levels that cannot be displayed with conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency mode also allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different display options and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the precise diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paraesthesia, burning pain in the legs set in as a result of the accidental infusion, combined with a loss of motor and sensory innervation up to segment TH 11. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications like the one described are usually based on errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but can be made less likely by taking appropriate measures.
Such measures include color coding of tubing, filters and IV fluids, and the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The observation of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology up to now.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of alveolar ridge height and width, 95 edentulous bony upper jaws from collections that were sawn, measured and classified in a standardized manner were first analyzed.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implantations were simulated in 269 cross sections and evaluated differentiated according to implant type, cross section position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was used in the clinical part of the study for 24 consecutive implant patients with an edentulous maxilla.
Implant placement in the cadaver jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but was actually to be expected in a further 4.5% if the jaw was sufficiently high.
Implant length reductions were also necessary in 6%.
There were dependencies above all on the atrophy class.
Anterior cross sections offered significantly more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not given in any of the 24 patients.
In 22 cases, the height was primarily insufficient; in 2 cases, an alveolar ridge that was too narrow transversally was only discovered during the operation if the height was sufficient.
The results allow the quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse dimensions of the maxillary alveolar ridge.
Bone height is of primary importance, although reductions in implant length are often required even if height is sufficient.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain on the cadaver jaw (12% of the cuts with expected implantability) as well as on the patient (8%), for which the sole height measurement simulates false conditions and a precisely planned surgical intervention may have to be stopped.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the consequences of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even demand extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, they can be detected using radioactively labeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven itself in different tumor entities.
In this study, PET was examined in lymph node staging of bladder carcinoma.
In 64 patients, a PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after iv injection of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), so that the PET findings could be compared with the histological findings of the surgical specimen after classic surgical lymph node staging.
Lymph node staging correctly identified positive lymph nodes in 14 patients;
A sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% can be calculated from these data.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and appear to be better than the classic staging methods such as CT and MRI.
The serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses of 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis were determined to reveal an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal total immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision as to whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, a paranasal sinus operation that protects the mucous membrane is indicated, but this alone cannot bring the desired success with this clinical picture.
An immune subclass deficiency is an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions to a severe immune deficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old woman who presented with extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk and on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a marked regression of the lesions.
Lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the "adult blaschkitis" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urinary continence after rectal resection has increased after nerve-sparing dissection and complete excision of the mesorectum became widespread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence between 25 and 67% can be found in the literature.
Material and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were visualized on 10 cadavers and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic preparations.
Their positional relationship and possible damage sites were shown and photo-documented in the course of the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically well-defined structures with little inter-individual variability.
The inferior mesenteric nerve forms a dense network of fibers around the trunk of the inferior mesenteric artery (AMI) for a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral wall of the rectum and the P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated using the standard surgical approach.
1. The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the lesser pelvis are not clearly explained in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers necessitates sharp dissection under direct vision.
4. Fascia and nerves can be used as guiding structures during dissection.
5. The selective sparing of parasympathetic roots in the lesser pelvis cannot be carried out using the standard surgical approach.
The early detection of second carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is important for the prognosis and groundbreaking for therapy planning.
In a prospective study from 1993 to 1998, 83 patients with histologically proven primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the lip were panendoscopied as part of the staging to examine whether an early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract is possible with this method.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx.
Microlaryngoscopy was the final step.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspect areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precancerous lesions could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of second carcinomas in a primary in the "head and neck area". .
Due to the good experience so far and the uncomplicated course, this examination does not pose any additional risk to the patient, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without reservation for the staging of tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's disease can cause considerable problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the beginning of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's disease, in whom the psychopathological changes formed the main symptoms over a period of 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significantly earlier onset of the disease compared to other affected family members were exceptional and therefore largely responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of earlier onset of disease is well documented in the literature in the case of transmission of the mutant gene from the father.
Pointing the way to the differential diagnosis were the observation of the initially subtle abnormalities in the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed survey of the family history.
A dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with a different focus:
as climatotherapy, as (balneo)phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain groups of patients benefit differently from this, indications for psychosomatic treatment are worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such a therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological origin or with psychological involvement, if depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation are present.
If there are problems in coping with the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
The following is intended to show the importance of orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses in the event of functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligaments of the ankle.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of the orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and the influence on athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene cups of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of deformation of the polyethylene.
The amount of wear is detectable by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first few years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it levels off at around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to loosening of the prosthesis.
In this study, the center of the femoral head in relation to the marker wire of the socket was determined in a total of 369 hip prostheses and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average run time of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n=109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
With the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was only achieved in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The pairing of polyethylene and ceramic reduces abrasion by half compared to the pairing of polyethylene and metal.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If there is an indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients who are unable to give consent, the supervisor's approval is required to carry out the treatment.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court assumed the justified risk of long-term damage to health and affirmed the approval requirement.
Electroconvulsive therapy, however, is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychoses, taking into account the contraindications.
The use of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs only very rarely and to a degree that is negligible in view of the risk posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, there is no need for approval by the guardianship court within the framework of the Care Act.
In genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance, malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered, among other things, by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH group is the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease to MH predisposition.
On the other hand, there is a high level of coupling between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) in the RYR1 gene could be detected in an individual from a large family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the correspondence with the IVKT was of interest.
The ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphomas in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system diseases in children are relatively uniform sonographically:
Initially, there is enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs, as well as disruption of the normal echo texture, usually in the form of hypoechoic lesions.
Four main infiltration patterns are observed sonographically in the parenchymatous organs:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "bulcky type".
A successful therapy can be seen in the ultrasound from the normalization of the lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity and the regression of tumor or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic clues result from the topographical distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, with certain reservations, from the echogenicity and the blood flow conditions that can be analyzed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
background and question.
In the case of the transient acantholytic dermatosis first described by Grover in 1970, itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles, which heal spontaneously after weeks or months, are usually found clinically, predominantly on the trunk.
Acantholysis is histologically typical.
Light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors, with the etiology still being unclear.
