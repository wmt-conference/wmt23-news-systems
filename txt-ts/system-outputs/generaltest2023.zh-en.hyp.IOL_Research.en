4.1 Overview
The characters in this file are encoded in single-byte, double-word, or quad-byte encodings.
The single-byte part contains all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte parts
The double-byte part contains all graphic characters from GB/T 2312-1980 and CJK unified Chinese characters from GB/T 13000, as well as some graphic characters.
Characters in the double-byte portion are as specified in Appendix A.
The graphics, code locations, and functions of the ideograph descriptors shall comply with the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 is the unified encoding of Chinese characters used in China, Japan, Enguo, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned a separate code position; characters with the same abstract glyph from different sources are assigned a common code position.
The encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and South Korea.
4.4 Four-byte parts
The four-byte part contains 66 CJK Unified Chinese Characters (9FA6-9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) in GB/T 13000 in addition to the above-mentioned double-byte characters, CJK Unified Chinese Character Extension A, CJK Unified Chinese Character Extension BCJK Unified Chinese Character Extension C, CJK Unified Chinese Character Extension DCJK Unified Chinese Character Extension .CJK Unified Chinese Character Extension F, and characters from ethnic minority scripts already encoded in GB/T 13000.
Characters in the four-byte section are as specified in Appendix C.
5 General structure
Hexadecimal is used for numbers preceded by 0x in the text, and decimal is used for numbers not preceded by 0x.
All codes in the appendix are represented in hexadecimal, and all other numbers are represented in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the GB/T 11383-1989 encoding structure, so that the 0x00~0x7F code points are used.
The two-character tribute part uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code point from 0x81-0xFE and the last byte code points from 0x40-0x7E and 0x80-0xFE, respectively.
The four-byte part uses 0x30-0x39, which was not used in GB/WP 11383-1989, as a suffix to expand the two-byte encoding to 0x81308130-0xFE39FE39.
The first character of a four-byte character is encoded in the range 0x81-0xFE; the second character is encoded in the range 0x30-0x39; the third character is encoded in the range 0x81-0xFE; and the fourth character is encoded in the range 0x30-0x39. That is: 0x81308130-0x81308139; 0x81308230-0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30-0x8130FE39; 0x81318130-0x813139; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30-0xFE39FE39.

If we find that the content of this man page causes obvious confusion and complaints because it is out of date, we will stop publishing it. There is no alternative to updating the man manual at the same time as updating the Info file, because the other work of maintaining Gnu cc does not leave us the time to do this. The GNU Project considers the man manual to be out of date and should use its time elsewhere.

DESCRIPTION The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file postname identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the postname controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and sets a connection of the form c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file and sets the c++ connection.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the type of language and the subsequent operation:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source code; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed c file; compile, assemble
.ii Preprocessed C++ files; compilation, assembly
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source programs; preprocessing, assembly
The .h preprocessor file; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other post-level names are passed to the Linker.
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
The connection is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process).
During the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including the specified .o H standard files and .a library files) are passed to the connector OPTIONS in the order in which they appear on the command line.
The options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly indicate that the language of the subsequent input file is language (rather than the default choice obtained from the filename).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered.
Turns off any explicit language specification, so the file RE AS E ` -x ' option after filename postprocessing.
If only some of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, concatenation) are operating, you can use the `-x' option (or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces source filenames with `.o' followed by `.ec'. You can use the -o option to choose a different name.
The object file.
Compilation is stopped, do not assemble parts.
Pipes are used instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assembler of those systems cannot read data from pipes. GNU's assembler does not have this problem, and the assembler can accept C "dialects": ANSI-compliant C programs are supported.
This disables some features of GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as features such as unix and vax that indicate that the ANSI trigraph is rarely used, and disables the use of all standard libraries available in a hosted environment, where the main function returns an int value, typical of almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding f£restanding environment does not have standard libraries, and the program entry point is not necessarily main, the most obvious example being the operating system kernel.
Function declarations with no arguments, such as `int foo ();', are handled C-style -- that is, without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the argument is empty.
The list of sections is cut from here to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
See the NU c manual for details, we have removed the details, so that when the content is out of date, people will not HERI.
Except for one thing: For C++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has the added effect of allowing this to be assigned.
It has the same effect as the ` - Ethis - is - variable ' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, it mentions the preprocessor, but not the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allows the use of the `$' character in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disallow the use of the `$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int and vice versa.
-fexternal--templates produces smaller code (C++ only) for template declarations by generating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' or '#Pragma interface' in all files that use the template.
When a program is compiled with `-external-templates ' , the template instances are all external types.
You can do this with a typedef , which refers to each instance you want.
Correspondingly, if compiled with the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows a mismatch between the types of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.
The value of this expression is Void. -fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (c++ only).
Merging user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the assignable `this' obsolete.
Therefore, by default, an assignment to this inside a class member function is invalid.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Defines char as an unsigned type, as in unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolic nature of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only simple chars, which are signed numbers (or unsigned numbers, depending on the target machine on which the program is written).
This option, and its antonym, causes that program to work at the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If the `signed' or `unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bitfields are signed, because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable - strings stores string constants in writable data segments, and does not treat them specially.
This is for compatibility with older programs where changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
The executive summary
Impact of Zika on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services to the point of collapse, and restrictions imposed by Governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the outbreak is unclear and difficult to predict, but it is likely to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to make drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders because of travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change, and the ability of governments to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began looking for cheaper synthetic substances, and patterns of use shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviours and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given lower priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
The direct impact on drug trafficking is expected to be greatest in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled on commercial flights.
Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine are carried by couriers, sometimes in large quantities, in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, and the use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted as a result of restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere.
While the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking is likely to increase.
In the long run, the recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders and turn to illicit drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.
Drug-trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
As governments become less able to respond, these shifts could quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
Population growth patterns partly explain the expansion of the market
Drug abuse has been increasing around the world, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, or 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018 there were an estimated 269 million drug users, or 5.3 per cent of this population.
Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during the period, which was 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the younger population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group increased by 16 per cent in developing countries, while it decreased by 10 per cent in developed countries.
1 Urbanization as a driver of the current and future drug market
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas. More than half of the world ' s population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest who bear the greatest burden of disease. Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly associated with the wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, it is the lower socio-economic groups that have a higher rate of conversion to drug abuse.
Data from a small number of countries suggest a link between harmful drug use patterns and conditions and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social strata.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, have in the past been associated with increased drug use, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work globally.
A pandemic may lead to a further expansion of the drug market, which may result in more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of the reduced control capacity of national authorities or because more people may have to resort to illegal activities in the face of the economic crisis.
Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of the reduction in air and land traffic as a result of COVID-19-related restrictions, as the risk of interception at sea is low and the volume of smuggling is greater than by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but potentially harmful new opioids are proliferating and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control, and the non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances on the domestic market of the Member States every year.
Currently most of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Opioid new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of new psychoactive substance types identified in 2014, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been shown to cause overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that stimulant injections of new psychoactive substances are also taking place in Europe: a study of the residues of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many were contaminated with stimulant-producing new psychoactive substances.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable populations
A single type of new psychoactive substance almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug makers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives not only to less regulated substances, but also to chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "tailored precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of Zika are likely to further squeeze producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already the case: in March 2020, a reported shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted methamphetamine prices to rise in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The volume of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation has decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.
But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a sharp rise in the number of clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs recently seized, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern in addition to fentanyl and tramadol.
A 2015 study further corroborated these findings, with users saying cannabis was harder to obtain than fentanyl or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities discovered a number of methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by one methamphetamine laboratory.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have risen steadily.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to 1^657 kilograms - a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first states to pass legislation in the United States, non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, particularly in the past month and on a daily or near-daily basis, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also suggest that the expansion of the legal market from 2018 to 2019 has been accompanied by an increase in usage.
However, 40 per cent of cannabis users in 2019 still relied on illicit sources to obtain some of their products.
Is the legalization of cannabis behind the collapse in global cannabis herb seizures?
Global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, driven by a decline in seizures in North America, which have fallen by 84 per cent over the past decade.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect The effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the adoption of domestic legislation has led to a decrease in the use of new psychoactive substances.
Vulnerable groups face harm from licit and illicit drug markets Medicinal opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries and are unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50 per cent are in North America, 40 per cent in Europe and 2 per cent in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12 per cent of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population but consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders About 35.6 million people had a drug use disorder in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences, as evidenced by studies in high-income countries in which individuals ' adverse socio-economic trajectories, not just their status at a given point in time, are associated with the risk of drug use disorders.
Drug use disorders can also contribute to a vicious cycle of disadvantage by deepening socio-economic disadvantage and further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, groups with diverse sexual orientations, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or have problems accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, the broader social impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past decade.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in disability-adjusted life years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high - 40 per cent.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to establish all causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data on a global scale suggest that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a bigger role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use may lead to criminality, in some cases the link can be attributed in part to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.
The links between drug trafficking and violence are manifold.
Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
The latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
But the harms associated with opioids go unnoticed because of the small number of users.
Such substances were responsible for 66 per cent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50 per cent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost to disability or premature death due to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is exacerbating the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fuelled by substances that are easily available and cheap to produce.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Similar results were reported in Canada, although the numbers were lower.
Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
The market for tramadol for non-medical use has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.
An increasing number of patients with tramadol use disorders are receiving treatment in the region.
Global seizures of tramadol increased significantly in 2017, peaking at more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.
Contributing to the crisis in both places is the simplicity and low cost of manufacture, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
Compounding the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Increasing use of stimulants
The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, with the use of one drug rising while the use of the other falls, sometimes increasing and decreasing simultaneously to meet demand in the same market.
Drug use increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people inject drugs in 2018 and that about 10 per cent of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and hepatitis C among injecting drug users remains largely untreated.
5 Opioid shortages caused by restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful patterns of use may emerge.

EU summit to debate refugee policy, EU officials: Reception process step by step bottleneck - China News
EU summit wrangles over refugee policy, EU official: Bottlenecks at every step of reception process
[Global Times Special Correspondent in Belgium Niu Ruifei] According to Agence France-Presse reported on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration as a way to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The EU's move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which now centers on the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be sent back.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilise significant EU funding" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance, among other things.
However, the EU is at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.
According to Euractiv, EU officials have admitted that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overstretched migration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "numerous" asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-permanent crisis.
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal migrants on the basis of a court decision in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the safe state concept," which could open the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.

U.S. escalates "chip war" to hit global semiconductor industry - chinanews.com
Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has escalated significantly - first, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under U.S. pressure; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off all ties between U.S. suppliers and Huawei and banning U.S. suppliers from supplying Huawei with any products; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries...
In recent years, the United States to crack down on China's "core" development has never stopped, while precisely suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, while building a "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to completely "leave behind" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan to establish a chip "quadrilateral alliance", or through the United States, Japan, India and Australia "quadrilateral mechanism", "Indo-Pacific economic framework" and other mechanisms to establish a "small circle" of semiconductor industry chain, the United States through the introduction of politicized, camp, weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing, to maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the United States' much-vaunted "core tactics" against China are also "a thousand self-inflicted wounds to the enemy and 800 self-inflicted wounds."
Recently, Panlin Group, a well-known U.S. supplier of chip manufacturing equipment, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters as a result of the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China.
Global lithography giant Asmar Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
U.S. media analysis, after the U.S. government's arbitrary crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many U.S. companies have suffered, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the specialization of the division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products need to cross national borders more than 70 times, the whole process reached 100 days.
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially advanced processes, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the United States-led "small circle" regional development, but the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industry is difficult to change.
The United States strongly "reshape" the "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain, hit the global semiconductor industry.
Chip is the core of the global future industry, the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introduced the Innovation and Competition Act, the American Competition Act of 2022, and the Chip and Science Act, taking advantage of scientific and technological hegemony to consolidate China's technological leadership; "encouraging" allies, inducing Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, in an effort to ensure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created problems and reaped real benefits for China's chip industry and related industries.
But in the long run, the U.S. hysterical crackdown, forcing China's chip industry to continue to break through, let themselves lose the huge Chinese market, will eventually greatly weaken the innovation will and innovation ability of U.S. technology enterprises, damage the development of the global chip industry.

According to the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Individual Pensions, the financial products in which funds from individual pension fund accounts can be invested include banking, savings deposits, commercial endowment insurance, and public offering funds.
The first batch of personal pension financial products were released, marking that personal pension investors can officially purchase financial products through personal pension fund accounts.
Last November, the CBRC formulated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies.
The Measures stipulate that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension financial management products, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public offering fund products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Rights and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice clarifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in 36 pioneer cities and regions, including Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang and Xiong'an New Districts in Hebei Province and Jincheng City in Shanxi Province.
By the end of 2022, there were 19.5 million participants in personal pensions and 6.13 million contributors, with a total contribution amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public offering funds.
Now that personal pension financial products have come together, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D Department of Financial Products of the Bank of Communications said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension financial products and personal pension financial products in the pilot phase have three characteristics.
First, the robustness, risk management mechanism is more sound, investment strategy and philosophy is more robust, and the implementation of non-parent third-party independent custody.
Second, long-term, the duration of pension financial products in the pilot phase are 5 years or more, the next issue of personal pension financial products, the minimum holding period is in principle 1 year, encourage holding more than 3 years.
Third, inclusiveness, product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, product hosting fees, management fees and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals point out that investors should choose according to product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have a long term, high interest rate, high security characteristics, suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, more suitable for people who can not bear investment risk, can accept stable income; while personal pension financial products and public fund products do not protect the capital or income, there is a certain investment risk, but the expected income is higher, suitable for people with a certain financial knowledge, high risk-bearing ability.

Fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of confidence-CNN
Another big gym "storm"?
Recently, the issue of the protection of the rights of members of well-known fitness institutions has aroused social concern.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the collapse of the organization caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human rights departments.
Finally, the relevant person-in-charge of the institution responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions experienced operational problems and were temporarily closed. Consumers could have been calm and waited for the problem to be resolved. Why was the first reaction of many members "something bad"?
Behind the uproar over the rights of health club members is the deep-seated problem of the crisis of confidence in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, "earning money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.
Through the pre-sale of membership cards to obtain cash flow, constantly open new stores, it seems to be able to cycle, in fact, eat grain, can not form a stable profit model.
Gym running and other industries negative information frequently out, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of the market, the gym is certainly a good business with a "money path" .
The fitness circuit has had its ups and downs, but it has always attracted capital attention.
A number of data show that cultural and sports consumption and other areas of rising heat, the market continues to pick up.
Specifically to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life deeply rooted in people's hearts, the development of the fitness industry is promising.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just out of the crisis, and sounded the clarion call to expand the territory, the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
Undeniably, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, the strength of enterprises at this time selectively increase acquisition efforts, rearrangement, is not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle, step up the road of stability, the industry must change the traditional model, change the business strategy.
Only steady, re-establish consumer trust, security, in order to truly win the market, win the future.
Compared with the construction of new stores to seize the market, the fitness industry currently needs more is to settle down to optimize services, with high-quality development to stabilize users.
First, it depends on the service to retain users.
Gym belongs to the service industry, its essence is to adhere to the "user-oriented", to closely around the needs of users, the business focus on service quality upgrading.
Second, digital transformation is needed to improve the user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model, to achieve user pay-per-view and venue selection.
At the same time, body data and motion data can be effectively used to meet social needs and achieve a complete closed loop of services from online to offline.
No personal trainer sales, no huge annual card, the user's concern about the "runway" of fitness institutions is reduced, and the sense of trust is enhanced.
In addition, we should actively explore multiple forms of business.
Today, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scene consumption, health clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption, around the fitness needs of sports supplies and fitness equipment and other peripheral products or will become a new profit point, to provide consumers with richer choices.

Buy expensive refund the difference!
Nanjing property market reappears "price difference compensation" - China News
Yangtze Evening News (reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangtze Evening News / Ziniu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "insurance agreement" not seen in more than a decade has returned to the Nanjing property market, located in Jiangbei New District, a real estate declared "price difference compensation", before the delivery of other housing offers greater than the previous discount, the developer is willing to exchange for the buyer and refund the price difference.
"Insurance Agreement" conditions can be a lot
The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangtze Yuntai, and Mr. Sun, the housekeeper, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the property promised that those who purchased the property between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the sales contract between the two sides to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the preferential discount of other properties in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial properties belonging to the same household type, the same building, the same unit, the same property type), the developer can exchange the property for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "premium agreement", the purpose is to let the buyer at ease, do not worry about the development of enterprises to reduce the price of the promotion, "now I am afraid to buy it after the price reduction, go to the sales office to make a fuss about it no time, do not make a fuss about it is really comfortable. "
There are many buyers believe that the "insurance agreement" although it is to give buyers a "pill of peace" , but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the first thing to insure the price of housing is the same household type, but also in the same building, the same unit, buyers can compare the price of few housing, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
There are also home buyers believe that due to information asymmetry, sales do not rule out giving additional concessions, buyers "rights" difficult.
Whether it can retain buyers remains to be seen

Taiwan's economy started the year poorly - ECNS
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) Export trade volume "even five black", manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted for seven consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) also saw "three prefixes" ... Recently, Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023.
Expert analysis believes that Taiwan's economy began the year with poor performance, growth pressure is not small.
Taiwan's exports fell 21.2 percent to $31.51 billion in January, the fifth consecutive month of negative growth, according to the Taiwan authorities' financial affairs department.
Exports of 11 major export categories declined compared with the same period last year.
Plastics and rubber products and optical equipment fell the most, by 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits fell 18.3% year-on-year, the biggest decline in 14 years.
Cai Mena, director of the department's statistics department, said that this shows the spread of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, the electronics industry has entered a period of correction.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports fell in January, with an excess of only $2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the decline in global terminal demand, industrial adjustment of inventories to curb the willingness of manufacturers to buy materials, export decline is unlikely to improve in the short term, Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
Taiwan's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at a seasonally adjusted 40.4 per cent in January, down 3.3 percentage points from December and tightening for the seventh consecutive month, according to Taiwan's China Economic Research Institute.
In the system of economic monitoring indicators, the PMI takes 50% as the boom-bust line, and an index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, while the opposite is contraction.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and labor hiring contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventories tightened.
All six major industries reported a contraction in the PMI, with the power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biomedical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
On the price front, Taiwan's Comptroller General's Office announced that Taiwan's CPI increased at an annual rate of 3.04 percent in January this year, breaking through 3 percent again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25 per cent to a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of Taiwan's Comptroller General Office, said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices did exceed expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71 percent in December last year.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on media reports from the island such as Yonhap News and Yahoo Finance.
Wu Daren, a professor at the Department of Economics of Central University in Taiwan, analyzed that the export recession may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the decline in orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and the household economy, which in turn affected consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is unresolved this year, demand continues to shrink, and predicts that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the full-year economic growth performance will be weaker than last year due to the impact of the export downturn.

BEIJING, Feb. 11 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Promoting Chinese-style Modernization is a Systematic Project--Four Discussions on Deeply Understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the Seminar on Learning and Implementing the Spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress
Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall consideration, systematic planning and overall promotion, and correctly handling a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to learn and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the Spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization, thoroughly and systematically expounded a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society and ecological civilization, and is related to the governance of the Party, the country, the armed forces, domestic affairs, foreign affairs and national defense.
Top-level design requires a deep insight into the general trend of world development, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, an in-depth exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the planning and policy system formulated reflects the times, grasps the regularity, is full of creativity, and achieves the combination of near and far, up and down, and content coordination.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many uncharted areas. We need to explore boldly in practice and promote career development through reform and innovation.
The question of strategy is the fundamental question of a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we should strengthen the forward-looking nature of the strategy, foresee the future and lead it with a scientific strategy; we should strengthen the overall nature of the strategy, focus on solving major problems that affect the success or failure of the cause of the Party and the state, and affect the whole body at once; we should strengthen the stability of the strategy, and once the strategy is formed, we should adhere to it for a long time, grasp it to the end, and make good progress.
We should scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of strategy, be flexible, adaptable, make decisions on the spot, and grasp the strategic initiative in the light of local conditions, the situation, and the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation of integrity and innovation.
To deal with the relationship between integrity and innovation, we should not only keep the essence and source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, and ensure the right direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize and adapt to change, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly shape new drivers of development and new advantages, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of equity, and equity is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
In promoting Chinese-style modernization, we should not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also safeguard social equity more effectively, and better balance, promote and unify efficiency and equity.
We should handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, constantly realize that development is for the people, development depends on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit all the people more and more equitably.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we need to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both dynamic and stable and orderly.
We should coordinate the two major issues of development and security, implement the overall concept of national security, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of state power, system, ideology and key areas.
We should not only give more consideration to security factors in development, enhance the strength of national security through development, and use development achievements to consolidate the foundation of national security, but also be good at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulate the vitality of development, and realize the benign interaction of high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we should not only adhere to our own path, but also expand our vision of the world, adhere to opening up to the outside world, and constantly expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We should adhere to independence, self-reliance and self-reliance, put the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, and firmly hold the fate of China's development and progress in our own hands.
We should continuously expand high-level opening-up to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win results.
You can only go far if you follow the path.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, grasp the law, persevere in practice, give full play to enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, properly handle a series of major relations, forge ahead on the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, and constantly open up a new realm of Chinese-style modernization.
The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the spy balloon program.
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize China's military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have had difficulty gaining access to U.S. technology exports.
The list, known as the "entity list", prevents companies from buying technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Sky Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group 48 Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Earlier, the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident caused further tension between China and the United States, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to China.
After the U.S. shot down the balloon on February 4, the Chinese government lodged stern representations with the U.S. Embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously impacting and undermining the efforts and process of both sides to stabilize China-U.S. relations.
Based on available wreckage evidence and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon was "directly related to the People's Liberation Army of China" and was an approved supplier to the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position on the incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship straying into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the United States Congress were pure political manipulation and hype.
China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it.
Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
”
An employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he had no knowledge of the sanctions and declined to comment further, Reuters reported.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States and has not yet commented on the information.

(Deutsche Welle) Days after an earthquake struck parts of Turkey and Syria, hopes of finding survivors are fading, but the rescue of a family of five on Saturday was a huge relief for searchers.
The family of five was rescued after being trapped under rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province, the Associated Press reported.
Rescuers pulled the mother and daughter from a pile of rubble, then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd cheered.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in severe cold weather conditions.
"What day is it?"
" the teenager, who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked his rescuers after being brought back to the surface.

Miraculously successful rescues have brought a glimmer of hope to an already bleak search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the death toll is rising.
Monday's earthquake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, according to official statistics, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated at more than 3,500.
Although experts say people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, hopes of finding more survivors have become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to look for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts began to shift to helping survivors in desperate need.
UN official: Disaster in the region "unprecedented in a century"
Martin Griffiths, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told a news conference in Turkey that the quake was the "worst disaster in a hundred years" in the region.
He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response as "extraordinary."
He also told Reuters he hoped to be able to deliver aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government and opposition, but said the matter was "unclear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in aid for people in Syria's quake-hit areas.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million for relief in Turkey and Syria.

Cai Qi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended the closing ceremony and delivered a concluding speech.

Google AI chatbot "answers wrong questions" parent company's share price evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars
(Comprehensive 11 News)
Shares in Alphabet, Google's parent company, plunged 8.9 per cent below the $100 mark on Wednesday, wiping $110 billion (RM476.5 billion) off its market value as of Friday's close at $94.57, after the company's new artificial intelligence chatbot, Bard, failed to answer the "wrong question" in a promotional video.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as good as rival Microsoft.
According to Reuters, Google earlier posted a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard on social media, in which someone asks Bard, "What new discoveries can I tell my 9-year-old about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?
In response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first pictures of an extrasolar planet.
However, according to NASA, the first image of an exoplanet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2004.
Reuters reported that "Alphabet shares plummet after Bard's wrong answer".
On the other hand, Google stated that Bard's response "highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process" and that it would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response "meets high standards based on quality, security, and truthful information."
Singapore's tourism industry recovers strongly, with arrivals 19 times higher than in 2021
The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) recently announced that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore in 2023 is expected to reach 12 million to 14 million, which will bring about S$18 billion to S$21 billion in tourism revenue.
The Singapore tourism market will gradually restart and recover in 2022.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, tourist arrivals in 2022 increased 19-fold to 6.3 million from 330,600 in 2021, surpassing the board's earlier estimate of 4 million to 6 million, and tourists have recovered to 33% of pre-pandemic levels.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totalled S$8.96 billion, and is expected to reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion in 2022, a six- to seven-fold increase from S$1.89 billion in 2021, and has recovered to about 50 to 52 per cent of pre-2019 levels.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced nearly S$500 million to stimulate tourism recovery.
The Tourism Board has announced plans to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract visitors back.
To make health and wellness one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) launched a call for expressions of interest on 23 November 2022 to develop a health and wellness attraction on Singapore's south coast.
'In recent years, more and more tourists have put their health at the top of their list of considerations,' said Wang Ling-li, executive director of sports and wellness tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which is home to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, allowing visitors to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism product in the next few years, said Tan Kin Lung, director of the Singapore Tourism Board.
It has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Bureau has been promoting health and wellness programmes to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health and Wellness Festival, offering more than 130 health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer visitors new travel experiences.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Central Beach Bazaar, the new "Explore New Frontiers" exhibition hall at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, and the new amphitheatre at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Wild Animal World to make Singapore an attractive international destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will develop industry standards for the sustainable development of MICE tourism by 2023, with a focus on improving waste disposal and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the airline industry.
Data show that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has experienced a strong recovery in passenger traffic, receiving as many as 150,000 passengers per day and about 1 million passengers per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-pandemic level, and the number of employees in the aviation industry has returned to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data show that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers, equivalent to 42% of the pre-pandemic level, and 170,000 flights, 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also led to the pace of recovery in the accommodation, transportation, dining and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, assistant director of the international division of the Singapore Tourism Board, said a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore ranked among the top three in the world in terms of safety, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is so popular with Chinese tourists.
Before COVID-19, about 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation every year.
As China relaxes its border policies, the number of Chinese tourists this year is expected to return to 30% to 60% of 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the tourism bureau will pay close attention to further signals from China's outbound travel policy to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in overseas travel from China.
Looking ahead to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the tourism industry will recover faster than expected as long as there is no significant downturn in the global economy affecting public revenues and no new large-scale deadly outbreaks.
Kim Jong Un father-daughter interaction intimate wife snubbed aside
North Korea held a military parade on the evening of the 8th to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the armed forces, and leader Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Joo-ae not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean state media released the film on the 9th, Kim snuggled up to her father, exchanged warm glances and whispered several times, she gently cupped her father's cheek with her hands and even touched his chest, and the father-daughter interaction was broadcast to the whole country.
However, First Lady Li Xuejun could only retreat to the sidelines.
According to South Korea's "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Seok-joo with their daughter Kim Joo-ae at the dinner on the 7th, Kim Joo-ae not only sat in the middle of her parents in the rare C seat, but she also joined Kim Jong-un on the podium at the military parade for the 75th anniversary of the Army Day the next night.
North Korea's state-run Korean Central Television later released footage of the parade, exposing more father-daughter love scenes.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, and the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Jong-un cupped his father's cheeks with his hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a big smile.
Other state media footage showed Kim repeatedly touching her father's face while sitting on an indoor sofa chair with Kim Jong-un, and touching Kim Jong-un's chest while walking arm-in-arm with her father.
The first lady, Li Xuejun, could only walk behind or sit on the sidelines, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that Kim Jong-Ai has been exposed more and more in the past three months since he first showed his face in public on November 18 last year when he test-fired the Mars 17 missile, and this is the fifth time he has appeared on an official occasion.
North Korean state media referred to Kim Jong-Ai by highly respected titles such as dearest son and honorable son, and also broadcast footage of Kim Jong-Ai in the stands overlooking the military parade, chanting his support for the white bloodline to the death.
These signs have led to doubts about whether Kim Jong-Ai has been internalized as the heir to the Kim regime, with The Washington Post analyzing that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un has pushed his middle-school-aged daughter into the position of successor", although some argue that such a judgment is still premature and that there are still possibilities in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son at his knees.

A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; and hourly wages grew by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slowing slightly.
From the aggregate point of view, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in the data, such as faculty and staff returning from strike, the revision of the survey statistics, the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, the follow-up may be revised (refer to the January 2022 new non-farm payrolls revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as reflected in the data.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is low; new employment in high-contact services such as leisure and hotels, education and health care has picked up significantly, and the data show that the labor gap in the service sector still exists.
Combined with the recovery in the services PMI, job openings and labor gap data, which also beat expectations, and the strength in consumer credit data, we see a quick recovery in the U.S. services sector after the extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will not improve without a recession.
There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor participation rate has been slow to rise, especially among 25-54-year-olds, who are near their pre-pandemic highs.
On top of that, strong consumer demand due to excess savings and strong consumer credit in the US will cause the impact of tightening policies on the job market to lag further.
Continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the backdrop for the U.S. economy in 2023.
Overlay is now near the end of the rate hike, inflation expectations continue to repeat, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the U.S. equity and debt exchange market expectations for the Fed's path of interest rate hikes were overly optimistic.
As the inflation data continues to improve, the Fed is shortening the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, not only expected to stop raising interest rates early, but also expected to cut rates twice by the end of the year.
In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market, the impact of tightening policy is unclear, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance for interest rate hikes is relatively reasonable, the market's extreme expectations of adjustment and trading congestion may have some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items gradually improving, since October, the U.S. CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, after the release of the next inflation data market or enter a new round of games.
Shanshan founder Zheng Yonggang died of sudden heart disease, led the transformation of China's first clothing - Economic and Social Council - Professional financial news
On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shangshan Holdings") issued an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to a sudden heart disease.

In 2001, Sequoia Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres and began to replace them domestically, replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery anode material production enterprises, to achieve the localization of lithium-ion battery anode material.
With the rapid popularity of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan shares began to develop gradually, in 2007 lithium materials business was written into the main business of Shanshan shares, the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, Shanshan shares of lithium materials business revenue fully exceeded the clothing business.
In February 2021, Sequoia successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company Sequoia Optoelectronics, the field of high technology content, Sequoia's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, " Chinese private enterprises to buy some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail?
Because everyone will think, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, this is usually an act to do", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang to Shanjin Optoelectronics publicly announced that Shanshan as the majority shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise two systems, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, Shanshan enterprises are not sent to Shanjin, take the way of authorized management, the original distribution system, corporate culture, management and other models remain unchanged.

Economic Observer reporter Chen Shan Fund purchase channels complicated account information collection is not easy?
Always forgetting the "little treasury"?
These problems of the Christian people are about to be solved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was listed in various mobile app stores and launched a public trial run.

The account systems of the share registrars are independent of each other, and there is no unified inquiry channel in the industry.
Some industry sources said that by the end of 2021, China's fund investors more than 720 million people, that is, half of the country's people have invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about purchases through different sales organizations, but through the "Fund E Account" can inquire about purchases through all sales channels, holding funds at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile phone application approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for the development and construction of the public offering fund industry portal, which can provide investors with a one-stop query on the over-the-counter share holdings of market-wide public offering fund products.

Specifically, the information that investors can access through the “Fund E Account” includes information on fund accounts opened with public offering fund managers throughout the market, trading accounts opened with public offering fund sales organizations, and over-the-counter share holdings of products including publicly offered securities investment funds and pooled asset management plans established and managed by securities companies where the number of investors is not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, head of business of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic and Social Council reporter that investors can get one-stop access to all their OTC public offering fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" app to help them retrieve their "forgotten assets", and more importantly, to achieve a comprehensive fund investment information collection for customers, to help customers more timely, accurate and complete grasp of their own investment situation, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How do I register to use it?
The reporter noted that at present, the "Fund E Account" APP has been listed in Huawei, Apple, millet, OPPO, vivo and other mobile app stores, but the APP is still in the public trial stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund held to obtain.

After the end of the trial run, open user registration will not need an invitation code.
”
Reporters according to the official website of the CSRC public "fund E account" download and use instructions related documents for account registration and complete the query, the whole process takes only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real name authentication, fund account binding, public offering fund query.

Reaching a Defense Consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines
ASIA – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment on the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the Chinese Communist Party's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hoped to use the meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and secured a $20 billion deal.
But after that, China-Philippines relations not only did not improve, but declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to U.S. troops and guarantee security in the South China Sea.
One of the new additions is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, U.S. forces may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the Communist Party of China" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Xia Liyan's visit to China conveys Song Tao's message: Welcome Green Camp's visit to China under the 1992 Consensus
Xia Liyan, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, met with Song Tao, Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Government Foundation, an official organ of the Kuomintang, spoke positively of Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that China welcomes Green Campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the 1992 Consensus and oppose Taiwan independence.
The Kuomintang side commented that it was a new thing.
Xia Liyan earlier met with Song Tao on the day of the news did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has for days clarified its rejection of the 1992 Consensus.
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit Lu. During his visit to Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
When Xia Liyan met with Song Tao, he said that the political foundation of the Kuomintang was the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, while Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang National Political Foundation, said at the meeting that the Kuomintang's "1992 Consensus" was the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analysis, this is different from the previous meetings to participate in the feeling.
In the recent video discussion with mainland academics, as well as in this discussion, we did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about Wutong and the "anti-secession law", but instead resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-Strait war is dangerous, and the Chinese mainland hopes to convey the intention of improving relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the Taiwanese, and the representative does not want cross-Strait relations to deteriorate.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao that "you must implement the demands they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) have made" and that if they could not be resolved in an overall manner, they should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang's visit to the mainland mentioned in person the daily disturbance of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fishing problems in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency reporter asked such questions.
French trade unions mobilize again for anti-government pension reform march
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions renewed their national mobilization against the government's proposed pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action in this social movement against the government's proposed reform of the pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call could affect the union group's next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight major trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time that the protest has been scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, who do not have to choose between taking part in a protest or a strike over pay, trade union groups are hoping that today's rally will attract more people.
The unions of the public transport system Metro and the public railway company did not call for a strike today. The public transport system should be able to operate normally, people can travel to the meeting place by car, and people can start their holidays normally in areas where schools are starting their winter holidays.
Trade union groups expect more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide and between 90,000 and 120,000 in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, the number of people actually taking to the streets has dwindled, although polls show that a majority of French people do not support measures to push back the mandatory retirement age from the current 62 to 64.
The first strike on 31 January gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
The number of demonstrators on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million nationwide.
This pension reform is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially those led by the Radical Left, submitted numerous amendments, so that the review process moved very slowly.
And the debate between the opposition and the government has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical left-wing France Unbowed party has sent a picture on social media of himself stepping on a balloon bearing the head of the labour minister, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually imposed a 15-day ban on the member ' s participation in parliamentary activities as punishment for such conduct.
So far, the government has not made any major concessions, although it has made minor adjustments to the draft, which has triggered the biggest social upheaval in France in more than 20 years.
Trade unions are already preparing to take action again next Thursday, the 16th, and are also planning to organize demonstrations when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion on March 7.
China encourages high fertility to universities to promote sperm donation high quality standards
China's Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank issued a publicity on the 9th, soliciting college degree or above or school students to donate sperm, 8 to 12 successful donations can receive a subsidy of 4,500 yuan.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the message hit Weibo on the same day, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
China encourages college students to donate sperm, according to an op-ed in the Free Times.
Among them, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of more than 170 cm, good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and myopia not higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Human Sperm Bank noted that sperm donors can receive a full set of andrological medical examinations worth 1,000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done and are of great significance to understanding their fertility status."
Sperm donor conditions include, height of 165 cm or above, college degree or above or studying, no color blindness color weakness, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank of Shaanxi Province printed a poster with the slogan "Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and "let love pass on".
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan, and those who qualify can receive 300 yuan in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of sperm donors can receive a subsidy of 5,000 yuan.
The highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
East Germany's last Communist prime minister dies today
"Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," the successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the election results, he ceased to be Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and reunification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
The allegations have been described as politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament from 1990 to 1994 and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said its achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in the youth fire brigade and, towards the end of the conflict, became a member of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to take part in the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist.
Returning home in 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he found work as a machinist and went on to study social sciences and economics, earning a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ranks of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) to become chairman of the Dresden Regional Party between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks anniversary of revolution, pro-protest hackers hack presidential TV address
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of its revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's televised address was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute when the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, known as "Edalat Ali (Justice for Ali)", appeared on the screen.
A voice was also heard shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
Iran marked the anniversary of its revolution with hackers disrupting state television coverage, Reuters reported today.
As Iranian officials mark the 44th anniversary of the revolution, Raisi's hard-line government faces its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Raisi still calls on the "deluded youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests are still raging in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Amini Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iranian security forces have launched a deadly crackdown on the protests, one of the most powerful challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since a 1979 revolution toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Messami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who were on hunger strike, as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
Human rights group HRANA reported that 528 protesters had been killed as of Friday, including 71 minors.
It was reported that 70 government security personnel were also killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests as well as support for the government.
On Friday night, the anniversary of the Iranian revolution, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)."
However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator!
"Death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, home-made anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacey's speeches were frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America" - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel."
Reuters said Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, was one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
And a week before Mesami's release, supporters warned that he was at risk of death because of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of a headscarf.
In response to Adelkhah's release on Friday, the French Foreign Ministry called for her freedom to be restored, "including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes."

The balloon incident shines a brighter light on America's eyes?
Tightening restrictions on technology exports to China
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the United States is ready to further tighten technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials say the balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China and will garner more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protection.
The U.S. said the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communications.
That's according to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This certainly adds fuel to the fire and supports the views of hardliners on China," he said.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday, "We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners."
U.S. officials said they had informed more than 30 governments about the balloon incident and that international coordination was essential to counter the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the new Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party in the U.S. House of Representatives could also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
Many advocates of tighter export controls are also pushing to expand them to include industries such as artificial intelligence, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The U.S. government is also already working on a foreign investment review program to examine U.S. investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts said the White House could face calls to roll out the program more quickly.
Turkey-Syria earthquake relief round the clock
Since a powerful earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working around the clock to free survivors trapped under the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings.
In freezing temperatures, they often call for silence as they struggle to hear any sounds of life from the crumbling piles of concrete.
Two more women have been rescued after surviving for days in the rubble of the earthquake, Reuters reported today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 and in Syria at more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours following the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, authorities said Saturday.
Another injured 55-year-old man, identified as Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city in the southeast.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sounds of life from the crumbling piles of concrete.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered "Inshallah" - "God bless" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking away his mother, who was dazed and pale but conscious on a stretcher.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been pulled from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with 31,000 rescuers deployed in the affected areas.
He said about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people left homeless by the quake were crammed into temporary shelters.
With many people suffering from a lack of food in freezing winter conditions, the population is increasingly questioning the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to Syrian state media, reportedly his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdoğan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdoğan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by disaster.
Anger over delays in delivering aid and starting relief efforts could affect the election, according to Reuters.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdoğan's two decades in power.
Erdoğan called for unity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
"The earthquake was big, but more serious than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence," the criticism said.

Hanoi, February 11 (VNA) - During his visit to Brunei Darussalam, Prime Minister Pham Minh Trinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) on the morning of February 11.
The University of Brunei is the largest centre of higher education and scientific research in Brunei and ranks third in the regional university rankings.
Brunei University is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
The University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University in Vietnam in July 2013, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, Moral Education, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei also includes Vietnamese in its curriculum.
During his visit to the University of Brunei, Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung and his wife had an exchange with Vietnamese language students.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung is pleased that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, thus making a positive contribution to promoting the image of Vietnamese culture and customs to the rest of the world.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at Brunei University will become stronger and stronger, and that the students in the Vietnamese language classes will become more and more interested in Vietnamese, study hard, become fluent in Vietnamese at an early date, and become ambassadors of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh also took the opportunity to communicate via video with Vietnamese students who are studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang to learn about their studies, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trinh believes that the partnership between FPT University of Vietnam and the University of Brunei, especially the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the educational partnership between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, we hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and China.
During his discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and the leadership of the University of Brunei, Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung spoke highly of the achievements in educational cooperation between the two countries, including the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, as well as the initiative of the University of Brunei to include Vietnamese in its curriculum.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh hoped that the University of Brunei would continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expanding the size of Vietnamese language classes.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trinh also spoke highly of the positive results of cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014, and recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out short-term exchange training programmes such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; believed that the University was growing stronger in the region and the world; and further expanded cooperation with Vietnamese institutions of higher learning.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and his wife planted a memorial tree on the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Trung wished the University of Brunei to continue to develop, contribute more and more to the cause of education in Brunei, and develop deeper and broader cooperation with educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

What exactly was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
Confusion and speculation abound
The U.S. military used its most advanced stealth jet fighter, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska on Friday afternoon.
The site of the downing was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
It was the second time in less than a week that U.S. forces had shot down an aerial object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed near the South Carolina coast after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said the second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). It was about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes there is currently no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.
John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the White House National Security Council, said Friday that while the specific appearance of the object flying at high altitude is unclear, it "poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Mr Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the US, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"We call it an 'object' is the best description we can give at the moment, " Bryant said.
President Joe Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the downing of the object, and he was "very cautious" in making that decision, Bryant added.
The official U.S. description of the object can be roughly summarized as: the size of a car, no joystick, no suspension, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But the information still doesn't answer basic questions, such as what exactly the object is, what country it belongs to, and what mission it's performing.
At present, many online analysis and speculation that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, as did the spy balloon that invaded American airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, on a mission of some kind in a different location.
Others have linked the "object" in Alaska to a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
"I wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO," former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer tweeted Friday, according to Newsweek.
"The irony of conflating an alien spaceship with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," Meijer said.
Meijer sent the tweet shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said Meijer was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO.
Representative Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, criticized the government's cover-up last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "UFOs."
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard for me to believe
I think very few people have seen this, but I'm going to say a little bit about it.
It was a zip-up hoodie when we bought it, and it ended up being a short-sleeved one.
After receiving the clothes immediately contacted Amazon customer service, when it was confirmed that the clothes are still in stock, I asked for a replacement, customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeves, the original link I bought off the shelf.
Then the customer service notice either keep the goods to compensate for a certain amount, or return the goods.
So this is how Amazon handles it?
Really unbelievable, the wrong clothes itself is not my problem, as a consumer I asked for what I should get the goods, did not put forward what is very exaggerated requirements, Amazon changed the name, said out of stock.
This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
Said to be cowhide, it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are a lot of small cracks in the area, it is not clear whether it is genuine leather, in addition to the sleeves of this dress is really incomprehensible, usually jacket sleeves longer than the hem, but usually 1-2 cm, this dress is a full 5 cm, the arm should naturally droop in the palm of the tiger mouth position, but the sleeves of this dress are over the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes and easy to return them.
But I don't know when I'll get my money back?
Clothes workmanship is good, because the fit is small, had to return, but after returning the goods, so far more than a week has passed, have not received a refund?
And to the purchaser himself and that integrity is not good all peak express contact, this is since the purchase of Amazon items since the worst shopping!
But the store is good, actively cooperate with the courier to urge a timely refund, but the full peak of the courier is really doing the work is quite infuriating, procrastinating half a month or so before the refund, this kind of partner is to drag Amazon's legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the woolen pants are good, soft/thin and medium, no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the version belongs to the thin type, more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2'5, stretch max size 4', 1.79/80kg is a bit tight on the waist.
There seems to be no elastic band around the waist, trying to loosen the waistline is quite difficult.
Also, close-fitting is uncomfortable.
Very good The color is not very bright
Just bought it up more than two hundred, what's the situation.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of the daily rotten courier, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative and the courier about two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, and then returned the goods directly to me, the damn courier has no integrity, it is strongly recommended not to use the daily rotten courier.
This time there is a T-shirt also returned to me, and the price of the shoot also increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon self-employed should not appear such goods
When the product is on sale to buy, the price is not low, read the reviews are also very good products.
I was flabbergasted when I actually received the product, the surface of the product is worn in a large area, many other places are worn, either defective or old, later on the picture.
I applied for a return, the manufacturer's people saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation, this is not nonsense?
How can the inside of the goods be worn?
There are only two possibilities. Either it's defective or I damaged it on purpose and returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I did not damage the goods, but in terms of my credit history in Amazon shopping, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon self-service goods, customers choose Amazon self-service is trust, customer win, we win, the victory of the customer is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope we work together to improve, thank you.
I've been using the product for less than a year and two E2s have appeared. I don't know what to do with them?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016 the receiver on the right two groups often appear red E2, should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not consistent with the Amazon website said the transmitter module can work for 7 years, and can not find after-sales on the Amazon website, now I do not know what to do?
It's all right
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn and the label on the fuselage was broken.
And there's always a white screen.
It's all right after the change.
Replacement is very fast, a little blurry at night, the viewing angle is not very wide, but the average household enough.
The shortcoming is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought the phone on Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, not this time, when you buy the phone there is a sticker-like seal that can be affixed to the warranty card, not this time.
I don't know if things are cheap there is no, very confused.
Waiting for a response from the supplier
Packaging does not have any markings, directly to the supplier called to say, the answer is not marked is genuine, such as doubt can be used scraps mailed to Johnson & Johnson company inspection, but also left the license plate number and phone number, promised to send a text message notice to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card, so far did not receive a text message ah?
The oil was received in the morning and changed in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own goods are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and bright, and that it was indeed good oil.
Because it's the second purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
Express speed, packaging is not fussy, with this oil, the engine sound significantly reduced.
Good value for money, it's hard to find synthetic oil under 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, effective protection of the car.
Amazon Japan's customer service problems caused serious damage to buyers (8c caterpillars shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitted the mistake, but has been prevaricating, always stressed that the goods are a third party, can not bind a third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
I originally purchased the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c, at that time I thought it was a trap, called Nichia Chinese customer service, clearly told 8 is 8c, but when the goods back to China only found that only 8cm, I think this is completely a deliberate trap to pit the Chinese (according to Amazon after-sales), now view the page has no such option.
Chinese customer service: I'm sorry to bring you losses, we give you two ways to go:
1, you return the goods, the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2, you do not return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I calculate the account, shoes more than 4,000 yen, counted as 200rmb, option 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss in 150rmb Customer service: We have recorded, we will deal with it seriously, the next day returned an email, said I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, and that's it.
I put forward: the purchase page for 7c, 8, 9c such a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me to say that the Japanese common code is not with c such, similar to 140 such, but did you specifically go to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are U.S. code, Japanese code mixed standard situation.
Besides, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, clearly the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there?
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know you want to ship back home, so we won't pay for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic, I'm Japanese, I also want Chinese customer service, living in Japan in China also do not need Chinese customer service, to Japanese tourists, do not have that kung fu to make international calls, then the problem comes, what people need to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone, nothing more than like me.
Amazon Chinese customer service is not convenient for us Haitao these people?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon, once in the baby 2 months when I bought a box, chose European imported paper diapers, the first purchase experience is more satisfactory, the baby all night with a diaper, can indeed meet 12 hours without changing the diaper.
But this time to buy L-size diapers, there are 2 packs of separate packaging in a box, after opening the paper is relatively loose, and imported Pampers has a clear difference, to the baby after use, it is OK, there is no leakage and no red rash and other signs.
But by the second pack of diapers, after the start of the baby's inner thighs immediately appeared a red rash, which has not faded.
Doubt 1 box of 2 packs, the quality is not the same ah.
Later should not continue to buy!
want to pay attention to the transport protection of parcels
This is my online shopping for so long, I saw the worst packaging transport, there is no protection, cushioning foam, package cushioning material, etc., nothing.
Just a deformed box.
And the inside of the soft plastic box packaging, the card box are pressed open to deformation.
Hope is genuine quality is guaranteed, after is not how dare Amazon to buy things.
I'd rather be half as expensive at home, with guaranteed points.
And the problem of commodity product packaging, I read the comments in 2016 someone commented, to now 19 years, or the same.
Shows that Amazon simply does not pay attention to service feedback this piece, and the domestic JD, Tmall and so on too far.
Good-looking, but a little sad
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange, although my family is a male treasure, but I still think orange with yellow is very bright.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out of the house, so it's acceptable.
Last night, I took it home and tried it. After the cap was pushed off, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close, because the position of the straw was positive and vertical, so my son always had to hold the bulge above the cap to drink water.
It seems that other brands of straw cups to make the straw tilt or make sense, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it's light and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to pack.
After buying found that the overseas purchase of the United States and Asia there is another brand very similar, only less than two hundred dollars.
Fake, fake is especially bad
Amazon sells fakes, and so do I.
Customer service said it couldn't be returned because it was used, and I didn't know it was a fake.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, is to wipe the face of the supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognition a little more expensive.
Because it is a second kill, so did not read the comments, I have submitted to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce e-commerce platform, let's protect rights together.
Is it bad?
A fake?
Tragic in a word.
With the second piece when the selection of pores fine, but as soon as it opened a strange smell, thought it was normal, because I did not use this, and then to the face when the whole can not stand, very flush taste, indescribable, smoked to immediately cough out, eyes are also very painful, tears, immediately picked to wash the face.
Do not believe in evil and opened a piece of the same paragraph, not so heavy taste, is now dressing.
It's kind of like the smell of a bad perm in a hair salon.
I can't imagine that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be shunned from now on?
The profiteers
At the time of purchase, the activity page is said to be full of 99 yuan to give away "Three Body Collection", received the goods did not have this gift, call customer service said to show them the screenshot of the activity at that time, the problem is who buys things and save the screenshot ah, you have done your own activities, but also need customers to help you provide ah, you buyers should pay attention next time, save the evidence.
Feelings after use
The first time to buy something on Amazon, respectively feel a few points, first of all, the feeling of running out of goods, the first is really painless, there is no irritating taste of things, overall very good, wait 8 minutes or so a wipe off, but there will be a small amount of sweat dregs on it, do not look closely is not visible, so overall is good, as after all use once to continue to observe, continue to use will know.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second order from the 27th, received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month, Amazon's delivery service attitude is also very good.
Third, don't believe what Amazon's Black Friday, order on Friday, wait 2 days on the cheap close to 12 yuan, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus shipping costs and what), there is a sense of activity on the price.
Customer service said that the price fluctuations, I paid attention to more than 10 days the price is the same, fluctuations are not big.
Affordable, Japanese origin, with Chinese label, with granules, absolutely buy back!
Paste with granules, refreshing feeling just right, after using the teeth smooth, than a second-hand Dong strong too much, where it is said to be imported things, but a lot of things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know where wholesale.
After as long as Amazon has, never go to the second-hand East.
To give a suggestion, Amazon's app on how to bask sometimes can not bask, I hope to improve some applications, will do better and better!
Excellent over the years, getting worse and worse, no quality of service at all!
Garbage excellence does not take into account the needs of customers Special delivery time 19:00-22:00 when placing an order.
Because there are inconvenient old people in bed after surgery at home, so only at night can be convenient to receive.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, without prior telephone notification.
If the delivery time is your courier's whim to deliver at any time, why pretend to make a time for customers to choose?
If their own logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not do electricity supplier!
Let an old man with 3 wounds get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier and change to pay!
There's a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end there is no one to call to give an explanation!
Excellent network so-called complaint customer service is a bunch of outsiders there to pretend, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called reply.
There will be no change or compensation!
Before also encountered such a similar delivery time is not the right problem to bear, but this time can not bear, too much!
New book to buy pre-sale after the arrival of the cover and back cover is reversed, so obviously the quality of the problem so close your eyes to the book to the customer?
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.
Excellent over the years, getting worse and worse, no quality of service at all!
Not a dime will be spent on excellence.
The picture quality is really unacceptable
As a title such as "Ancient Atlas", the selection, layout, and printing of the pictures in this book are unacceptable, and some of the pictures even have mosaics that are blurred beyond recognition.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the catalog of the ancestors left behind the ocean of ancient documents!
What's the difference between using such images to put together a book and not using them at all (and many of the images are available as clear source files from relevant industry sources)?
I regret such a spirit of learning.
The text is not evaluated, the Fang family has its own distinction.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school, I was just bored to see the mentality of play, I felt that such a book should not be addicted to it, after all, the starting point of the net text in the past is not very attractive to me.
And then... it fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively light-hearted, the first part of Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even the intrigue between the guild, but also because often by Ye Shen dog blood, not heavy at all.
As for the part about the game, I wrote a little poignant (maybe I'm sentimental) about the changing times and the alternation between the old and the new.
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time description of the characters and emotional line is very amazing, some characters are only occasionally brought, will also leave a deep impact on people, such as the more focused character Ye Xiuhuang Shaotian Su Mu orange have a large number of fans, and not in the writing center of the characters such as Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu and so on are also very likeable, in an e-sports cool text actually let people can not find a person who is extremely annoying, this is full-time in the character description of the success.
And on the emotional line, full-time does not have the general network article is criticized by the harem beauty 30 million either beautiful or rotten problem, the full text of all people's feelings, there is a common place is that they like the glory of the game, and most want a dignified victory.
There is a small measure but no big plot, everyone looks so simple and lovely.
That's probably why there's no such thing as an obnoxious role full-time.
Full-time IP is big, and thanks to that.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, Full Time is a good book.
How much he really will provide people with some warm blood, a little bit moved.
Full-time animation in April this year.
In fact, I want to buy this set of books for a long time, hindered by never having a thick enough wallet did not start hard, and then when I want to buy it, I found that it is simply rampant fakes on tb, in fact, full-time recently came out with another version, cover art bar I like it, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set at one time.
Next, a brief description of the goods.
● The plastic cover of the fourth book is not available, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth plastic cover is in but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange feeling no other hard.
The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.
● The publishers of the individual books are different, as if #23 and #17 were the same publisher and different from the others.
● On the whole, it is satisfactory, 24 books is a big box, very satisfied.
Lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as The Lost Dime, but it turned out to be a lot of text!
It took three readings to finish the book for the children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fudge.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Seeing that in the end, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself, he is not a complete lion, nor is he a complete man.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, not knowing where he had gone.
Perhaps many years later, the image of the little lion will remain in the impression of the grown-up child, inadvertently remembered one day, perhaps she will be touched or inspired.
A very good value for money portfolio
1, did not know TASCHEN before, recently bought a lot of their books, the reason is too strong, whether it is the choice of topics or the production itself.
There have been three editions of the work, the largest of which, like the complete works of Michelangelo, is nearly 50cm long and 34cm wide; the middle edition is about 36cm long and 23cm wide; and this edition is the smallest, with two volumes in a bookcase.
Personally, I think it is acceptable, first, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages divided into two books, as a paperback is also better to read; second, unlike Michelangelo's complete works, the paintings occupy the main body, Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority, for the limited budget, non-art professional readers, this edition as an appreciation of paintings and manuscripts is the best value for money.
2, the painting part of the explanation is very good, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I do not know whether it is the printing or the size of the book, some of the shadows are too deep, can not see the details, a bit of a pity.
In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, the latter dabbles in a wide range of achievements, not enough to be described as a genius.
If you could only see half of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings before, you would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.
Rubbish, who buys who regrets!
Never give a bad review, this sincere garbage, bought a waste of money God horse, give a reason!
It's not the right time to go, suddenly it's January 1st and the time is zero.
2. Poor quality belts, not silicone, with wrist allergy blisters.
3. I often can't connect to my mobile phone.
The battery life is only five days.
5.Sleep detection does not show, the time is 0.
6 is not waterproof.
7 for others.
The logistics are too slow
Showed October 16 to, the result was received on the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too bad, buying on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
The overall satisfaction
Before the beginning also worried about the packaging of the camera, this time is good, there is an inflatable bag, the camera three codes consistent, can also be registered on the official website, the number of shutter 0, the rest can only wait for the time test.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here to spit out the courier brother, valuable items are placed in the porter, go fast, I can not open the box in front of him to test, on this point is really speechless.
The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping:)
Businesses are more responsible, specifically called to ask the screen size of the camera used, really for the sake of customers.
The delivery is also fast.
Diamond film affixed to it is also quite suitable and useful.
Unsatisfied with battery charge
The machine is really good, want to ask how to charge the first time since the charge is not satisfied ah, the charging indicator light has been red
Currently can not find the official Amazon feedback channel, so can only feedback in the product review
1. On March 29th, the book was purchased for $31 through pre-order, indicating that it would be pushed to devices on March 31st, at which point the book could not be previewed on Amazon's website (because it had not yet been released);
2. March 31 pushed to the device of the book, the content is blank, only please look forward to, and Amazon on the electronic version of the book price reduced to 18 yuan;
3. Over the past two days, repeated attempts to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and sync it again have failed to obtain the electronic version of The Nature of Business, which contains the actual content, but it has been possible to preview the book on Amazon.com.
At the moment I have a few thoughts
1. The issue of price is not the most important, the key is now how to replace the blank book on the kindle with a book with actual content, rather than forever download is "stay tuned"
2 pre-ordered books should not be bought again, after all, in case of ticket skipping, and then download an empty content of the book, the procedure looks very complicated;
3 hope that Amazon can give a normal channel for feedback on such issues, when the e-book download, or use of questions can have a place to feedback (tickets, online customer service can be, you can refer to the official Microsoft store is how to do)
Not very recommended reading
Read a long time ago, happened to see the memory to write a little after reading it.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely flat, is the same kind of plain water, the words and sentences to the pursuit of simplicity to the extreme, the plot is like a summer afternoon on the street, silent and flat.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in an ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
It was eventually collected together under the title What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.
I think, this novel collection, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the stage of joy and sorrow, urban legends of the sea dry and rotten, not only you and I Nong Nong like glue, love is more than the above and should not be represented by the above, love is also as plain as water life, boring day after day, there is no clue to life, the reality of the escape, the future of the daze.
As you read this book, your mind may recall the quarreling couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading it. Aesthetically, the writing and plot are tasteless, and unless your life is stormy or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you'll have to read it with a sense of wonder and boredom.
In terms of intellectual depth, the everyday plots do not illuminate or expand one's thinking or vision (unlike Márquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief episodes do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is why the book is a poor reading experience.
Suitable for coarse reading, not close reading.
The logic of the book is good, but the content is not full.
Explains a lot of the what and why of sales theory, but is weak on how to do it, pointing the way but not giving specific practices.
Also, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples are both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.
I don't know if it's a story compiled for the sake of example, but it would be more convincing if some of the author's own cases were cited.
Vary in the appellation of customer or client.
It's still a customer in the title, and it becomes a customer in the body.
There were also typos, missing punctuation and wrong numbering in the e-book.
All in all, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but not for people who are already in sales and want to improve their sales.
A quick guide to understanding Internet finance
This book is very shallow, can be said to be just an introductory course, can help you quickly understand the overall picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, or to follow the map, their own to dig deep.
And the book was written earlier, later Alipay WeChat by subsidy war to cultivate user habits of the content has not been mentioned, today's third-party payment share is not the book said that the proportion is so small.
Now a lot of people go out to eat with a mobile phone, businesses also because the bank flow is too high reasons, abandoned UnionPay.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this primer. I can see that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write high in the sky, but it's hard to write easy to understand.
Appreciate you, more want you to know!
The number one factor in determining a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough at work.
According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, after a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of the "love you in the heart" is difficult to open, even with love, gratitude and appreciation is silent in the heart will not say.
In this book, the author describes the five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, thoughtful moments, acts of service, gratifying gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them from the bottom of your heart anytime, anywhere, to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer we are, the more we need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate, enterprises can also retain talent to a certain extent, reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.
Due to the Chinese and Western cultural background and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between the languages, if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version I believe it will be more rewarding.
Thanks again to the authors and translators as well as the editors for their hard work!
Suspected of counterfeit goods, please Amazon strict review
Super poor quality, baggy packaging, no weight, not even as good as roadside stall products, no gram weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also baggy, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a return; completely belongs to the quality problem; it is recommended that businesses shine their eyes, refuse inferior goods; added: and bought a heart-to-heart, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, plus a few comparison photos, to further verify the inferiority of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic losses and further upset!
Amazon is once again expected to be scrupulous and strict about the source of goods.
Sloppy product, and a gap in expectations
The advantages:
1.Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectations.
Disadvantages:
1 charging no indicator light, this is the most basic of your power instructions are saved, estimated to buy 300 yuan of products for customers, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, is also charity, no respect.
2.Strong odor When charging, even if only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
The office tried it for a day, and the whole house smelled of plastic.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS of the same price I used before, although more than a cutter head, but Panasonic this product, the quality is really sorry for consumers.
The small package
Received the express a look at it said the e-commerce version know and fell into the pit, better than the supermarket to buy smaller, should be M, with the product introduction above the picture packaging is not the same, the so-called new version of it.
Three stars is to blame for their own sloppy did not see clearly the product specifications, you sell M code e-commerce version I have no opinion, you goods are not the right version is a few meanings?
E-commerce routine deep, there is time or go to the supermarket to buy.
Just sauce purple.
The taste doesn't like it
The child does not like the taste of toothpaste, every time said spicy, perhaps with other words to describe more appropriate, the child's vocabulary for the time being only this word.
Bought at the time of the event, very cheap, so sorry to give a bad review, four stars, but will not buy again.
Genuine yo Well packaged
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there are no online reviews of what a bare product looks like.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle as described in the picture, the delivery is also very fast, photographed the next day came.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it'll be on the shelves again.
A bad shopping experience
Black five when the order, the result of waiting for a long time did not receive, after a query, the package has been signed for, asked around the colleagues said did not help sign for, quickly contact the courier company, but said to the sender in order to launch an inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited more than ten days, finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly sent to others, and several turnarounds to finally get back the courier, the outer packaging has been opened, the goods are still complete, do not know has been used, in short, very bad
Wrong mapping
I thought I was able to receive Figure 1 such a headset, but did not expect to receive Figure 2 such a headset, the picture is not consistent even if the headset left and right sound size is not the same what does it mean?
Although the name is the same, but I still hope you can pay careful attention, in addition to Amazon responsible for the timely replacement of the correct picture, thank you very much.
General operating system
With a period of time, the overall picture is OK, do not feel any difference, is that the system makes people look tangled, boot time is obviously a bit slow, can not be set up very well, and then the software is not to comment, the response speed is more general, and colleagues home compared to that is not an order of magnitude.
Look at the comments that very user-friendly design, I did not find where user-friendly, remote control this commonly used up and down around, the position of the return key design is really not flattering.
So, let's use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.
The price cut is too steep
The price reduction is too strong, more than a hundred into now 99!
I accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I uniformly used a copy of the text as the content of the evaluation.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product is at least 85 points above.
And poor products, I will never be lazy to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will be used as a reference when buying, and businesses will improve the quality of goods as a result.
Low price good line, no fever on this enough!
Such a cheap line, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard, personally compared to kill domestic Akihabara these bullshit things (the price is twice as expensive), the line is strong, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, after the low-cost line to identify Besi!
Things are OK, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other sites
After the order was found to be wrong, but the cancellation of the order has not been cancelled, the web page contact online customer service has been showing the wrong link, can not be contacted.
After the arrival of the delivery man called me, I said I do not want, want to cancel the order did not cancel successfully, the delivery man took it back, said first to me to sign on, let me apply for a return.
Apply for a return only to inform the food once signed for can not be returned, there is no way to call Amazon customer service, is the same statement, signed for can not be returned.
I used to buy in Jingdong and Suning policy can not be returned items, including milk, diapers, etc., contact customer service have been returned, and Jingdong diapers after opening the taste is too big contact customer service to return the same, to you Amazon can not.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me either I take it myself, or let the delivery man buy it himself, it's not easy for people to send a delivery man, why should I let people pay to buy something that is not their own purchase?
Okay, I won't refund it. I took it myself, but I have to give you a 1 for your service.
Advise everyone not to spend money in vain
First of all look forward to buying, think Dule brand should not be bad where to go, received after looking at the packaging feel OK, size is not bad, but there is a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat in the mouth completely tasteless, tasteless, bite open the pulp of a circle is dark yellow is bad kind, good or bad ginseng sold, can eat less than a third, advise you not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Eat a cut and grow a wisdom, and never buy fruit in the electricity supplier again!
Where is the product security mark
The bottom corner of the bottle is badly dented, should have experienced a strong impact in order to cause, from the outer packaging bag, feel the degree of ravage people heart-wrenching, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, but also belongs to the international purchase, and did not see any obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, open the bottle is very easy, the key is a layer of honey inside the lid directly out of the inside, there is almost no adhesion of the opening, foreign products are like this?
Being born in China, I don't understand it.
It's supposed to be authentic, right?
There is also a shot when prompted to arrive on the 20th, this is the 14th received, I bought overseas for the first time here, just write down their doubts, perhaps this is normal?
Pick-up service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons, in the pick-up, the first appointment to pick up 3 copies, the result was only sent 2 copies, after multiple communication to confirm that it is missing, promised to be reissued; the second appointment, just in time for the rest of the day, the website and WeChat did not prompt the need to make an appointment on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic, it is recommended to improve in the future.
Good shopping
Stuff praise!
Still more believe that Amazon self-employed things, now after the overseas purchase is very convenient, from abroad to buy back logistics time than the domestic also more than a few days, have to say that Amazon overseas purchase to the domestic customs clearance ability is still very strong, much faster than the transit, so now a lot of things are bought overseas to buy.
I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, a lot of things are domestic, but go out and buy back cheaper than at home, I hope to improve.
Garbage
See such a package, try to ask everyone: do you think it is roadside garbage?
Is it responsible for a plastic fragile package to be sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag?
I see such packaging is the same as garbage, the purchase of this product, packaging and its poor, without any measures to prevent damage, on a simple plastic bag packaging, to hand, the package is completely deformed, the items inside are also damaged.
If I just came across one of these, I recognized it, bought a few are like this, looking for Amazon customer service, customer service said it can be refunded, but the shipping costs advance, and then the shipping costs in the form of a gift card back to me.
I try to ask, I use cash to pay for shipping, you give me back the gift card, this is to buy your gift card on my own, but also to mail the product to the German warehouse, this is not to buy a product to suffer ah!
And I have been telling the customer service, who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say half of their responsibility, even half of the responsibility do not dare to assume, such after-sales service and what guarantee? In a word: recognition! But I estimate that I this evaluation, Amazon will not give the opportunity to publish, directly back to delete!
The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics are poor
1, the quality is very good, kill, the price is moderate, value for money.
2, strong, sufficient material, strong solder joints, proper surface treatment, good color.
3, logistics is hard, 3 under the single, 11 to the.
4, if Amazon did not indicate that the estimated arrival time is February 7, I might be satisfied.
5, but marked the expected arrival time, it is equivalent to a promise to the user, when the promise can not be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
6. Don't make a commitment if you're not sure you can give it.
In fact, I care very much about the promises made by businesses.
8, so, I scored low.
The gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious, depends on the individual, or psychological effect.
One thing is not very good, is the gold thread, originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold thread will fade, put on the car, if you move a few times, hands, and the car, there will be some gold dust.
Hopefully the product can be improved.
This kind of square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in gold wire, fall off in the car dirty car trouble.
Things are in good condition, the speed is OK, divided into 2 parcels and different packaging
8 days of speed is quite fast, but is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shockproof too much, thick cardboard, sealed with a layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to remove, a domestic express box-like, put a few cushion airbags even matter, feel a little perfunctory.
Arran mattresses are really good
34CM mattress is not generally thick, do not sleep directly on the mattress can be.
The quality is very good, whether it's the front or the back, it's very soft, it's very comfortable to sleep on and I fall asleep very quickly.
Mattress received because of the express violent transport there are some stains in two places, Yalan customer service is very responsible, very efficient contact to solve the problem.
Not self-employed goods, Amazon shameless
Page clearly marked self-employed, in fact, by the supplier distribution, after-sales by the supplier is responsible for the problem to contact the supplier.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not cancel; want to return the goods, in Amazon successfully applied for a return, sorry, no one to you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.
This Nima branch sells its own goods.
Goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not bear, customer service even said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed to be self-employed, too shameless, naked shameless, naked fraud on consumers!
Depressing experience
Before in other online purchases of filter cartridges, filtration effect is good, after the end of 28 days and then use more than a day or two is also no limescale.
Due to the quality of things that have been purchased on Amazon can be, this time I want to buy on this side, the first time in Amazon to buy filter cartridges, feel not very good, not only early began to have limescale, and filter cartridges have been used until the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, really do not know whether to continue to use, or directly throw good, very depressed ~
Not as good as imagined
Compared with the plug-in board I have used in the past, the external workmanship in general, how the interior is not taken apart to see, I hope as described by the shop, from the point of view of ease of use, each independent unit is energized lack of display
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging damage is more serious, the box inside seems to be new, but the instructions do not seem to be new, only renovated in September, stocking, I hope it will not be bad, please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the packaging damage, but you can be safe, thank you!
Overall good, a little problem
The first time to buy a water filter jug, read a few evaluation articles, felt that LAICA cost-effective to choose this, received the goods according to the instructions installed the filter cartridge, tried it, feel good overall, but when pouring water as if the raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank seal is not too tight).
Be sure to wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture does not capture the details of the side, the details of the side and the main body style is not consistent, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, there is no indication of origin, this is the second; there is no indication of texture, this is the third; when I bought in the UK, clearly each has a box, there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the beads, where I can judge whether it is true or false.
Be careful what you buy, especially what comes out of Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
Order placed two days ago, received today found a drop of 40 yuan, spent a lot of time to find customer service, customer service said can not make up the difference, you can rebuy and return.
This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than a certain treasure.
Okay, as a beginner, it's worth starting
The quality is passable, and the best King Kong is not comparable, before I saw the price of the mall, not to mention hundreds, I am the first time to play King Kong, OK.
The stuff is good
Things are really good, sent to my girlfriend, but I was not in Canada at noon when the express some unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail storage treasure and did not send the verification text message to me, causing me to run twice.
But the baby's really good.
It's worth buying
Little monkey cute, Amazon discount is really strong, Zhou Shengsheng official website direct delivery, the night before the order, received this afternoon, really fast.
Postal couriers are also very responsible.
It's great!
Confessions of a customer
1 Receive such defective products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry ah, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle you contact customer service, they will tell you that the problem will be dealt with by a specialist, who will inform you of the outcome.
You can never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, do not know her work number, there is no direct contact telephone, that is, you can not contact her, only she contact you.
The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly three days, the commissioner contacted me, I left my mobile phone for a while and did not receive a call from the commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours without waiting for a call from the specialist, during which time I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed customer service to ask her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the defective coffee machine I received!
There is no problem with Amazon's goods in the United States. Overseas shopping is good, but the service is far worse than in the United States and Asia.
6 For me I can only continue to wait. . .
The bottom is not flat
Because look at the reviews are very good, all look forward to this pot, when you get it, also like, very light, but when you open the pot found the problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, protruding in the middle, concave around the perimeter, the oil has run to the perimeter, purposely bought to open the pot fat fried a lot of oil can not cover the central area, paste, open the pot can not open, such a structure is estimated to be unable to cook normally.
I don't know if I was unlucky enough to get a pot with an uneven bottom, but thanks to Amazon's one-month return service, I returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot clean and retired, working in vain for a long time.
Good product design requires a matching manufacturing process to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design.
Cube shape, the designer treated the top into a slight curve.
It was supposed to be a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the top cover of the water box.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are not consistent, after piecing together there is a height difference of up to 2mm or so.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said to have destroyed the whole sense of design.
A little heartache for the product designer.
It seems that the beauty of the product manager has not been able to create such a level of product.
(For the after-sales lady's feedback of course can not be too demanding, but when I heard the after-sales said that this product all individuals are like this, not only I bought this one has a problem, her disapproval and truthful burden of emotions let me understand that the United States can not be too demanding) 2019-7-7 water pump failure water output is low, has been the second repair, the first repair two weeks after the bad.
It's a good deal after the offer, Amazon fake offer is sad
Baby born a week to buy, super insulation.
The outside of the pot can not feel a trace of heat, that is not afraid of hot people can also effectively protect the temperature does not dissipate.
After a night the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said anniversary activities 320 big discount, later found that everyone 249,289,299 have, an instant sense of being cheated, but went to the supermarket to compare it is still more than the same price of a variety of miscellaneous cards, the future can go out with the car.
Vitamix 6300
Has been watching for a long time, see the United States and Asia 6300 discount, Central Asia overseas purchase the same price, hurry to start.
September 2nd order, the expected arrival is the 21st, the result of the 12th arrived, almost 10 days in advance, the speed is really fast!
The box is not big, directly with the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid to cross the ocean broken!
The machine looks very new, complete accessories, is the cup on the base of the shaking, I am afraid to boot the cup directly fly out!
Ask a friend who has 5200, listen to his description does not seem to me this so loose.
Randomly attached to the recipe all in English, look very tired, the Internet did not find the Chinese version, this is a trouble!
After receiving the goods hurriedly bought a transformer, estimated 3 days to get it, and then a good toss!
Too small, no umbrella cover, general material.
It's not a tuba at all!
The second Totes, 1.This one has no umbrella cover 2.Umbrella handle is made of ordinary material 3.It is clearly written Large, in fact, it is a convenient umbrella for one person, which is estimated to be enough for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought in the United States and Asia can be used by three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel so good
The first is that the box is not very strong, with a press on the deformation, followed by the back of the design of the flat to prevent the box ABS scratching and does not play a role, again is the inside of the box is a piece of cloth wrapped, the place where the lever stands out... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
It can also be
Pros: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can't be put down (a little longer won't do), the backpack zipper can be locked, but there is no lock for the buyer, can't be described as service-oriented.
Overall OK, don't know if it's real leather
The overall feeling is OK, do not know whether it is real leather, you can not blindly evaluate.
Can hold A4 format documents, over 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard box-like object (can not be deformed) is estimated to be unable to hold.
The bag is very soft, inside the inner pocket separation is also more humane, or quite good.
It's just that I got a small trachoma at the bottom of this, I don't know if it's my bad character or?
Too lazy to toss back and forth to exchange goods, bear it.
Four stars overall, it's still worth it.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world Camera Strap SLR Strap
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging over the shoulders, practical, and the chest is made of soft material to fix and protect the camera, unlike other fast shooters with screws to fix the bottom of the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off photography.
Junk after-sales
I bought the piano a month and a half ago, missing a part, after informing Amazon gave me the after-sales phone, after many communications, the part has not received now, what is the efficiency of this!
Estimated after the problem maintenance more trouble, looking forward to a good after-sales friends or detour it, too much trouble!
Small flaws, good timbre
The head is defective, missing a horn, it feels defective, and there are no freebies, but the price is good, and the tone is good.
It's all right, the first order of noodles
Used for a long time, except the bass can't come out, overall not bad.
It is that the workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I first bought it, there was something wrong with it, all the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.
Ask for a replacement, the result of the goods to Shanghai for three days, still not delivered.
The phone call to the delivery was not answered.
The courier company said they only had that contact information.
Amazon couldn't find a place to complain.
Without asking, in the case of delayed delivery, inexplicably delayed delivery at my request - such a text message came.
What about the transit problem later.
Anyway, the very poor shopping experience, began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don't think I'll get it today.
Labels are too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, but the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; and the label stickiness is very poor, for the cable label is not at all, very easy to fall off, bought for the organization of the cable friends need to pay attention to.
The pen is OK, but the package is too rudimentary, just a cardboard box, no protection, and the box containing the pen with a large piece of transparent glue, tear off the glue on the box.
Six hundred dollars worth of stuff is treated like this, very disappointed in a shopping trip.
But there's nothing wrong with the pen.
Hope to improve the packaging in the future!
The quality is not, if you talk about writing, not as good as 925-25
First praise the daily express bar, air parts, super fast, service attitude is also very good!
Have been using 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen did not say, the style is also very beautiful, the reason to give four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the cap to adjust the length of the lead is a bit wobbly, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.
So become an Amazon diehard powder
Bought at a super discounted price, and as a result, the child doesn't like the reading pen.
Opened, tried to apply for a return, actually free pick-up.
It's too bull.
It is not recommended to return goods, but such a service is the only one in China.
I hope it's not abused.
Later books, all moved positions to buy here.
Headphone bias, and noise
This headset is a piece of crap. I don't know if it's my ears or if it's just not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue two years ago in a certain easy, the sound quality is good no noise bass is also good, used for more than two years with bad plans to buy another (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
Looked out of a purple very good-looking, the result of buying this today to open a listen to feel wrong, one side of the voice is loud and the other side of the voice is small.
At first I thought it was because of the sound of the song did not think much about it, but after listening for a long time I found that this problem is very serious, not only the polarization, the bass effect did not sound as good as the one I had before, but also some noise, is only I bought this purple has this phenomenon? Or now the headphone manufacturing process is really not good?
Pretty poor review, very disappointed.
Be sure to return it during the day tomorrow.
PS good face value
This AV amplifier set up complex, rough appearance workmanship, large heat.
The sound will take a while to evaluate again!
August 14 just started the German version of DN1080. A look at the outside workmanship is poor.
1. Front panel, knobs are plastic.
2.Rear panel audio input jack, speaker output terminals are poor, casually find a 1000-2000 CD amplifier machine is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, my transformer side is still concave, had to open the box to restore by hand, the combination of the top cover and the front panel loose.
4.The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward to move.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony is going to be foundry in China much better than the pony.
5.The machine heats up, watch a movie with two channels for about 2 hours, the top cover with your hand to touch 40-50 °C, do not know if the transformer is too big heat.
Now multi-use switching power supply, this stupid transformer is estimated to have 4KG.
Sony should have used a silent fan for active cooling inside the machine, only to see a large aluminum heatsink on the tube after opening the box.

Haven't taken it apart
The battery is in use.
I'd love to dissect it and see what's in its belly.
Think about it later, in case you are disappointed after taking it apart, it would be wrong to spend so much money; in case you are satisfied after taking it apart, it would be difficult to put it together again, and it would be unpleasant to use.
Come on, even if Sony uses a good battery.
As for the detailed description of the amount of electricity, the average person will look at the heart will be empty.
Fortunately, I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time, in addition to do not understand the circuit, is also half a battery engineer, can withstand.
Overjoyed
Before buying the heart is really bottomless, until the opening of a look at the packaging feel very positive!
Finally when I touched the headphone cord, it felt very flexible, the quality is too good, can't wait to plug in the phone to open qq music.
I was amazed that the sound quality was surround 3D!
I asked in the physical communication store, almost 30 or so, but by no means Pinsheng brand, is miscellaneous, so this Pinsheng although 27 pieces, but the price is definitely worth having!
Worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but it was not received until October 12.
Check Amazon order status, the seller did not provide the courier number, can not find out where the order is.
So sent an email to the seller to ask if you can provide the courier number, after two days there has been no response.
In desperation, call Amazon customer service, customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, I called again to ask the store, after a few calls, the phone, was told that the courier lost, you can immediately re-send me a.
Although I was particularly angry, but because of the urgent need for the computer, so I did not say much to the seller, as long as immediately sent to me.
As a result, the next day called and asked, has it been shipped?
The seller said not yet. It won't be delivered until this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said it would be delivered after 5 or 6 p.m., but when I called at 7 p.m., no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no, and told me that if I was in a hurry, let me order from another company, and if I could wait, it would be delivered in the afternoon.
No way. I'll have to wait a long time to order from another company.
Just ask the seller to hurry up and deliver the goods.
Finally, after numerous follow-up phone calls, I received the computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll add a comment later.
Just bought half a year did not use a few times, now the contact is bad, ask can be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it much since I bought it.
Just take it with you a few times in your business bag.
Recently found that when the power is turned on, do not charge, you need to hold the charger and the connection of the line with your hand a few times, in order to charge.
Doubt is the interface contact is bad, do not know now can also be repaired?
It is highly recommended that Amazon deactivate EMS!
Commodity five stars, logistics one star, average three stars.
Do not understand why Amazon to send EMS, the industry is recognized as unreliable, well, the computer is also valuable ah!
The purchase order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days ah!
22 in the morning to check the logistics finally to Fuzhou, ready to be happy to receive the goods, as a result, in the evening did not receive any phone calls, text messages, a check the logistics, even at noon was signed, but also showed that I signed!
I was in instant shock!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
It's almost doubtful that life is good!
Finally made a trip to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two single numbers, but the piece is not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon do not use EMS, and if Amazon uses EMS delivery, I will not buy again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, just bought a few days to find a price reduction, bad reviews, this is not bad, cost-effective, cpu and graphics card enough to cope with the mainstream online games and quite a few large stand-alone, cooling is very good, but the screen is a bit light leakage (ips screen common problem), sound quality is not very good, hard disk is not good (suggest to spend some money to add a solid state), yesterday took the after-sales testing of the hardware, there is no problem, comes with win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller shipped quickly, all inquiries answered quickly, received the computer the next day the invoice arrived, good, but unfortunately no gifts.
(By the way, to buy a keyboard film must not go to a treasure called E cool digital center shop to buy, slow delivery of poor quality, product problems do not return or exchange, the boss is also full of foul language, special exposure)
Things are good, platform bureaucrats remain
Hard disk quality is very good, cost-effective absolutely high, cheaper than Hong Kong to buy, not in a hurry to use and can stand the logistics absolutely recommended to buy.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same, and a few years ago I swore I would never use it when there was no improvement, you can never find out the actual logistics situation, the information is always sent a few weeks later, you can never complain, it is so bureaucratic!
Goods received a few days, logistics information or 10 days after you will receive the goods!
No peace of mind in logistics
Sent in this way, not only the packaging flattened, electrical packaging is also open, do not know whether there is a transfer package.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
Checked on the Internet, may be a common problem of water, and there is no warranty.
Depressing!
Now wrap it in cling film and continue to use it. I wonder how long it will last?
Buying someone else's opened
More than three hundred machines to more than a hundred tax is indeed relatively high, see now more than six hundred heart balance.
Received when the sealing tape state looked very wrong, like opened, rushed to take a photo first, and sure enough, a tear on the open, open the inside of the cardboard is still damaged, worried about the return of others, not yet to the anniversary of the first hurried to my husband to try, the results of the machine has no electricity, fortunately there is no slag inside the blade, not too far how to return ah!
Good to use or short-term will not have any problems is not known, such as the previous evaluation, out of stock when issued something really unreliable!
Upper-middle level of experience
Almost the top electric, there are many kinds of teeth cleaning mode, but few people will change the different modes of brushing every day.
With half a year no problem, brush every day, almost more than a week flush.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap to buy on Amazon.
App is a bit difficult to use, in addition to changing the color of those, other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?
Those who wish to learn Dafa.
Very good value for money
It's been used 3-4 times.
1, the packaging is in good condition.
2, very simple to use, cleaning is also very convenient.
3, can completely DIY haircut, save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
The last time I bought two packs, actually two different versions, the original packaging on the bottom left corner of the word is green, the result of a pack is not, is white word, the result of the cat ate diarrhea.
I'm not sure if Amazon's source is fake, or if it was dropped by an employee during delivery.
I'll buy it again, and if it's still a fake, I'm going to have to find someone to blame.
It's a horizontal bar!
Isn't it deceptive that the Amazon image is slashed and the result sent to me is a horizontal bar?
The effect is OK
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
It does have an effect, too.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grinding instep.
It is not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but this one is too bad.
Additional: today compared to the previous UN series of insoles (shoes throw pads to keep), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, breathable is not as good as before, is fake soft.
2. My instep is not high, the part of the instep is about 3 cm forward at the highest point.
Bought three pairs of clarks overseas and only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my favorites.
Back to try rockport, can't only go to the ecco store.
Substandard good, bad quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime overseas purchase Ups is very strong, 31 under the order 6 received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
Shoe size is a little larger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide shot 7.5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but usually like to wear a little loose, pad a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering, a sole rubber is damaged, another upper has a variety of scratches and a needle eye, the upper and the sole of the joint of the rubber strip misalignment, clearly inferior to good!
It's a bit of a regret!
Do activities 280 yuan to buy, this price to buy Arthurs quite a bargain, of course, look at the reviews there are lower prices.
Now about the shoes, the advantages: shoes are very light, running is very comfortable, but also more comfortable, will not be loose.
The face value is very high, but the disadvantage is also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, this time bought 40.5, put into the front of the shoe is about 1 thumb distance, but, this does not affect anything.
The shoe is "narrow" and feels tight, although there's still some distance in front.
Another point, the shoes may not be very breathable, now wear feel very hot feet.
Press the instep of the foot
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard kind, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, amazon love step also bought a few pairs, never appeared to be out of place, but this pair I refer to the reviews, buy a large size uk7, on the foot because of the size of the length is obviously longer, but because the insole is too thick, or pressure on the back of the foot pressure, coupled with hiking shoes very hard, resulting in very uncomfortable on the foot.
If your feet are not particularly thin, this is not recommended.
If you must buy, change the insole can also solve, but the original insole looks very high-class appearance, do not have a pity.
Perfect for a shopping trip!
Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchases are genuine no doubt, the quality is also very good, cheap, buy rest assured, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, deal with the problem patiently and efficiently, the perfect solution to worry, supporting the courier delivery is very convenient and secure, the delivery master is very considerate of customers, every time will remind timely pick up from the courier cabinet, thank Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I'm really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronics on Amazon in the future.
It's been a long time, but it's still going to spit.
Bought in winter, less than 200, put at home for a few months useless.
Spring to use when found and how the bracelet can not be connected, both equipment manuals support each other, and later found that it should be the heart rate belt problem, because to find other equipment or can not be connected.
Call Amazon, let me contact the agency, the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, things were sent back in their original condition, even the express box is the one I used to send it!
There is no reply and receipt and test report!
How do you tell me, is it good or bad ah!
Call and ask, and say that it's good to send it back to show that the equipment is OK.
But I still can't connect, the agency replied: That's none of their business.
Unlucky for me, I'm too lazy to be tossed around by you for 200 bucks.
Seriously wrong goods.
It's very wrong.
The headband material is very good.
It's much better than nike.
The breathability is also very good.
It's just the cap on the front.
It is very fine.
Is it meant to be funny?!
It's completely out of the sun.
It is not returned because it functions well as a headband.
Wear it up, though it won't block out the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Keep it for use.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, the delivery man is very good.
I require delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's rules don't allow Saturday, Sunday delivery.
Hurt me, from the field to drive 200 kilometers back to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how do I love you again?
The delivery man was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give me a thumbs up!
Commodities, briefly tried, not bad.
But have not bought similar goods before, can not compare the price!
Size Logistics
Workmanship can also be, is the logistics is too slow, the previous shoes are DHL, this Apex is really... domestic bought a lot of UA, the price is not low, feel engaged in higher than NIKE ADIDAS grade?
In fact, it's all the same Okay, so sea tao.
Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, I have broad shoulders, the general clothes are 180, buy M, hem slightly longer, other wear just right, I see there is a recommended S size, the figure is so slender? Or like tight? I think the hoodie or looser better.
Just the right size
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, consulted customer service before purchase was told should buy xxl, and then read the comments decisively start L, after receiving the goods found that the size is just right, almost was the pit.
The price of double eleven is much more expensive than black five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z affordable goods problem is very troublesome!
Ordered on the 18th, received the goods on the 25th, Guangzhou to Beijing snail speed!
Bought Z affordable goods, the description told there were scratches, but after receiving the goods found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child does not want to return, thinking that the problem is not big, but accessories such small parts, the child's grandfather ran a few nearby hardware stores did not buy!
Finally Grandpa stuck it on!
It seems that in the future can not buy Z affordable goods!
Toy processing quality is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, on the bolt is very laborious, visible processing quality is not good, do not know how long you can play, because it is a promise to the child, it will not return.
Other reviews said it was easy to install. Is this the only one I have a problem with?
It's very average
Could it be that I'm out of luck?
The packaging is old; the workmanship is mediocre; the music is one and only eight seconds long and then repeated; the action is to shake your head and walk along without any change.
It's not worth the price.
If it's urgent, don't return it.
The quality of the toy is good, spit out the packaging
Yesterday received the express, Amazon bought, marked EMS delivery, and finally Tmall's express delivery, this is how many turns? Amazon and Tmall relationship is good?
Talk about the packaging, is wrapped in cling film a few layers, there is not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap, open a look, all the parts are placed in the empty box, fortunately the toy quality is good, there are no broken parts, is much smaller than imagined, because it is not with batteries, push often derailed, feel the gap on both sides of the track is too big, the design is not reasonable.
Good quality, fun
It's fun, the precision of the components is very high, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembly is very interesting, I to spell, five-year-old son to play, very good.
He laughed and laughed and probably will continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.
The machine is new, the sea is good
Have a look at Christmas, before buying expensive 150 yuan, but the delivery is a little slower.
The machines are still good. They're all new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then connect the elf ball and it will send a dream.
It's good to play, better than ps4, high portability.
Already bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Production of rotten goods, the sale of rotten goods, the result of rotten goods service, bought six watches to send children, one of the fast digital display is not complete, six pieces of time are inconsistent, the difference between ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask the watch in the warehouse to check the time? They replied that "yes", since there is, then why the time difference so much, it must be that the watch does not have accuracy, simply put is a marine product, not what I said ugly, look, it is clear that the quality of the problem (digital display is not complete) are out to sell, is not junk.
I contacted the seller, the seller said a lot of reasons, but also complained that they should not have bought their things, such a product, such a seller, such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, it's also junk.
Amazon shipping problems
After receiving the goods, the inspection found that:
1, the table packaging is seriously worn.
2, the table instructions have serious use of folds.
3, the table does not go, the desk lamp charging is not used, can not adjust the time.
4, respectively contact Amazon customer service, can only be sent to the United States at their own expense, after the postage.
5, 2 points because the customer service is not bad.
It can only be said that it's OK
Time is not very accurate, about a second faster every day, with only a few months has been faster than two minutes.
I've used a piece of Citroën before, and it feels like a year or two won't be a few seconds worse.
Perpetual calendar function is quite good, chronograph function is a bit of chicken, basically not used, occasionally mistakenly touch into the chronograph mode.
Solar-powered sports watch
Pros: Solar charging without having to worry about changing batteries, world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Shortcomings: the mirror is easy to scratch, into the dust.
Value for money: domestic general price between 220-300, overseas purchase more than 180 (takes about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch
Must be genuine, to the counter inspection, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, fine workmanship, sufficient materials, plus it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, is those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches can not be compared, this is the real thing.
The time of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, there is a jewelry certificate in the packaging of the watch, the 12 characters of the dial there is a real diamond, this is very suitable to wear, as a gift to send out is also very face.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23, his wife's mobile phone fell, on a whim immediately ordered an 8p Amazon, in stock but not self-employed and no mark-up (heart secretly happy), because not self-employed delivery is relatively slow, the system shows that the latest expected receipt to September 27.
My wife died without a mobile phone, the next morning more than 6 o'clock called me to think of a way, and later on Jingdong a look at 256G goods can be delivered the same day, had to immediately order another one.
When the new one is ready, I want to cancel my Amazon order right away.
As the order is placed in the middle of the night, it is not possible to receive the courier in the early morning, more than 7 o'clock to call customer service to cancel the order, customer service reply has been cancelled please wait for SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently, to noon on the phone to see, the order is still in the status is not shipped, immediately contact customer service to cancel the order, customer service reply has been operating OK.
At 3 p.m. on the phone to see the order is still there, there is no way but to contact customer service again clearly informed that the third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller must not be shipped!
Customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request, and told me that the seller is not familiar with the system, to wait until familiar with the system before operating to cancel the order.
But clearly tell me that the seller already knows, absolutely will not ship please rest assured.
When I looked at the order on Monday, it had already been shipped, and I was speechless.
Since you can't contact the seller directly, you can only call customer service again.
The back of the processing is simply speechless, basically I said a step, customer service then proceed to operate.
The order is still in the delivery rejection status so far and is ready to be delivered again!
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow suit?
It doesn't matter if the seller takes the money anyway and doesn't follow up.
Summed up after the big piece will never pay in advance, this look is too cumbersome.
It looks beautiful
I liked this camera a long time ago, but because in addition to the price, there are some other reasons, so did not buy, this time because of the package, the price can also be bought.
After buying the other is no problem, is in the software connection, how can not connect, my home is TP router, after checking the Internet found that many people have this problem, get more than two hours, various changes to the router settings, finally I use 360WIFI as a medium to get good, during the call to millet customer service, they have no solution to this problem, directly let me contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments on the Internet that this camera supports the smallest memory card is 8G, smaller storage capacity can not be recognized, I hope you pay attention to this.
It feels OK to use it, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, has been turned on, feel this degree of heat is a bit difficult to accept.
To sum up, this product still has many shortcomings, I hope you should be careful when buying.
The reason to give 3 stars, because this is and the first love of life to buy, dating for nearly 3 years, so last year left me, until now.
The reason to give 3 stars, because this is and life's first love to buy, now do not know to what extent, perhaps throw it away!
After nearly three years of dating, she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache, the first woman in my life, brought me a lifetime of shadows and heartache, so far have not been able to come out.
When you buy this mobile phone, think about how the two felt at the time, or can share joys and sorrows together, but now it is hard to look back, life may be like this, some people do not want to meet in their lifetime, some things do not want to know in their lifetime, but what is the way?
How many times when I saw this Samsung mobile phone, my mind thought of her, that kind of pain followed to fill the whole body, I have never been reluctant to use more than 2,000 yuan of mobile phone, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate, no matter how good to a person, but one day when she changed her mind, all the vows will disappear.

Some people may think that saying that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is a reversal of cause and effect, and that the true causal relationship should be "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment"; however, studies have shown that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed "more bad behavior in children" rather than "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment", and that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is supported by post-analysis; moreover, even after controlling for various variables that may affect children's behavior, such as parents' social status, "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is still true, i.e., corporal punishment itself does lead to more bad behavior in children, and its adverse effects cannot be explained by any other possible cause; other studies have found that educational strategies that emphasize care and supervision are effective in reducing the incidence of bullying

In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the British colony of Bencoolen. He was convinced that Britain needed to find a strategic position beyond the Dutch, the dominant power at the time. Trade routes linked China, Britain, and India, and trade with China, in particular, required a foothold. In addition, the Dutch were strangling British trade in the region by prohibiting the sale of British goods in Dutch-controlled ports, especially in Batavia, where the prices charged for goods were unfavourable. The challenge for Raffles was to establish a new port within the Dutch sphere of influence. However, none of the British ports were suitable as trading centers at that time. They were all too far from the Straits of Malacca. When large ships were passing through to trade with Indochina, they had to enter from the adjacent Indian Ocean, or from the Sunda Straits, which were further away.

The Dakivali family originally intended to take care of Marlequin on their own, but she cried constantly (others say she was born mute) and refused to drink milk or allow the women of the family to bathe her until they brought in the Manigai of the other group, and she did not cry when the Tu 'uligit came to bathe or change her diapers, so the two families took care of her daily life, the Dakivali family providing food and taking the girl home at night (others say the ancestors of both families were divinely conjured by Satan Yale to take care of her), and the Vikivan family taking care of the vigilance; when the baby girl began to eat solid food, only the heart, liver, and hind legs were eaten, so when the people hunted or killed pigs, these parts had to be sacrificed for vadis.

According to the current official timeline, the oldest game is Sword of Heaven, and the most recent is Tears of the Realm (although Nintendo has not included this game and Breath of the Wilderness in the three timelines mentioned above), but in order to meet the need to expand the worldview and timeline in the game's production, most of the story settings in the series have been retroactively revised or amended in different games; for example, the Temple of Time, mentioned in the 1998 Ocarina of Time game, is located in the temple's time-traveling portal, and the origin of the temple and the time-traveling portal was not explained until the 2011 release of Sword of Heaven, 13 years after the release of the two games; this effectively dissects and expands Zelda's worldview through flashbacks, and gradually solves the plot mysteries of previous games.

Most digital libraries provide a window to search for resources that are typically deep in the web (or have little or no presence on the web). These deep in the web resources are often not found by search engines, so some digital libraries create special pages or sites that allow most search engines to find all of their resources. Many digital libraries often use the Open Database Protocol (OAI-PMH) to make their data available to other digital libraries, and many search engines such as Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo!, and Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find these deep in the web resources.

People have different views on whether the death penalty can be left to public opinion; in practice, there have been governments that have left the death penalty to public opinion.

When external energy is injected into an energy level system and absorbed by an electric field, photon, chemical, etc., it causes electrons to transition from a low energy level to a high energy level. When photons produced by spontaneous radiation encounter electrons that have jumped to a high energy level due to external energy, these high energy electrons are induced to move to a low energy level and release photons (so-called stimulated radiation). All optical properties of stimulated radiation are the same as those of the original spontaneous radiation, including frequency, phase, and direction of travel.

On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted research on assault rifles, concluding that although the existing 8mm Mauser cartridge had a range of more than 800 meters, the long range was difficult to use in combat, scopes were not widely available, most soldiers' marksmanship was not up to the level of snipers, and the high rate of fire could suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing cartridge was too heavy on range, powerful, but the recoil was too great, and it would be difficult to hold steadily if used in fully automatic fire, and the hit rate was too low to be practical.
There were also dances for special occasions, such as the "Victory Dance" to celebrate war victories and praise achievements, the "Friendship Dance" for social events between neighbors or friends, the "Ghost Dance" to invoke ancestral spirits to fight with the spirits of dead soldiers after contact with whites and war, the "Corn Dance" to pray for or give thanks for a good harvest, or "The Booger Dance" to pray for the banishment of disease or whites, the Booger being a demon believed by the Cherokee to be evil.

Litter bucket toilets were first introduced in the Denver, Colorado, school district, which has been the scene of several school shootings. In emergencies such as shootings, police ask teachers and students to shelter in their classrooms until police have cleared the campus and determined it is safe to come out. John McDonald, head of security for Jefferson County Public Schools, said the idea came up several years ago, when a school in the district was locked down for hours after a shooting threat, so that students who needed to go to the toilet had to use garbage bags and cans. After the shooting threat in April 2019, the school district began equipping classrooms with portable toilets based on cat litter. Diana Wilson, a spokeswoman for the district's public schools, said most teachers supported the decision, and litter bucket toilets have been added to Denver's teacher ration list, along with items such as pop-up tents and first aid kits.

At that time, the Japanese Navy had been ordered to blockade Hong Kong waters. When the British torpedo flotilla sailed to the waters east of the Lantang Strait, it was spotted by the Japanese Fir-class destroyer and Hung-type mine boat Magpie. As the difference in firepower between the two sides was very large, Chen Tse instructed the torpedo flotilla to line up and speed towards the Japanese ship, pretending to be about to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship. In fact, the torpedo boats did not carry torpedoes in order to lighten the load and carry as many men as possible, and to avoid the risk of explosion when the torpedoes were hit by gunfire. However, the Japanese ship saw the torpedo flotilla coming aggressively, was deceived and took evasive manoeuvres. The torpedo flotilla escaped the Japanese ship's interception. The flotilla passed through the Go Chau Islands before turning to Dapeng Bay. Finally, Chen Tse and more than 70 others landed in South Australia on the Dapeng Peninsula.
Buddhism rejects some of the views of Brahmanism. For example, in the Bunsen Sutra, the bodhisattva questions why the god Brahma allows suffering and evil to run rampant, similar to the problem of evil. Some Buddhists also deny the existence of the god Brahma from the logical level. Therefore, Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from Lord Brahma, who is still trapped in samsara. In addition, Buddhism denies that Lord Brahma is the origin of all things, and believes that Lord Brahma is only one of the five existences. Therefore, some theologians who came to Hinduism later accused Buddhism of promoting nihilism. However, Buddhism refutes this claim, saying that the root of all things is emptiness, and that it is emptiness that allows all things to appear and change.

On the time and location of the closest approach to Macao, the meteorological agencies of Hong Kong and Macao disagreed - the Macao Meteorological Bureau said that the closest approach to Macao was at 1 p.m., passing about 40 kilometers west-southwest of the headquarters of the meteorological bureau, but the after-action report of the Hong Kong Observatory and the positioning of the meteorological and astronomical of Macao showed that the pigeon passed only 20 kilometers south-southwest of the headquarters of the meteorological bureau of Macao at 12 noon. Some people questioned whether the meteorological bureau made a mistake in the positioning of the pigeon, the structure of the pigeon was complete and tight, and there was no central circulation reorganization at that time, so the chance of positioning error should be small. From the radar map, we can compare the 2012 typhoon Vicente hit Macao, the positioning of the meteorological bureau was also 40 kilometers, and the eye diameter of typhoon Vicente and the pigeon were also 50 kilometers, but the center of the pigeon was obviously closer to Macao than Vicente, the actual distance of the pigeon may be only 20 kilometers.

Lithography was first invented by Czech-German Alois Senefelder in 1798, when copperplate printing was too expensive, so he used Bavarian limestone as the material for engraving, and the stone plate was his tool to transfer ink, in an accidental situation, his mother asked him to write down a laundry list, but the paper and ink around him ran out, so he had to use his correction solution (composed of yellow wax, soap, black pigment and water) to write on the stone plate, and then curiously poured some nitric acid on it; due to the anti-corrosive composition of the correction solution, the writing was raised, and this was the beginning of the use of slate for printing.
This is usually due to the fact that some village committees in inland provinces are still dominated by older people with older ideas, who believe that matters related to family property should be mainly inherited through the patrilineal line, and that if a woman has something in her name, it will become "someone else's" and other weird ideas. Therefore, unmarried women who do not act in accordance with the laws and regulations are especially "prevented" by village committees and will not be easily allocated land.

Unlike the State Duma, which is divided into branches of political parties, the Council clearly shows that no political parties exist in the upper house.

In the course of the battle, the protoss thought that the zergs of Ayr had become wild after the death of their master, but did not expect that there were hybrids in the zergs to carry out systematic tactical command, which surprised Atannis and Zeratul, and then Amon's powerful dark forces invaded the protoss mind-spirit network - Kara, instantly took control of most of the protoss on Ayr, including the archbishop of Atannis, Silentius executive, because Zeratul belongs to the dark templars of Nirasim, since ancient times their people do not want to be associated with Kara, so the mind was not affected by Amon, so Zeratul immediately led a team to rescue Atannis, hoping to cut the nerve cord connected to Kara before he was controlled by Amon, but it was too late.
According to the Chronicles of History, Yulang was the largest country in Yizhong in the southwest at that time, "Lin zhi jiang", when Emperor Wu of Han intended to attack Nanyue, he sent Tang Meng to send an envoy to Nanyue, found that there was a local medlar paste produced in Shu, and learned that it came from Yulang, so he wrote to Emperor Wu that he could pass Yulang to control Nanyue, so Emperor Wu sent Tang Meng to send Yulang, saw his leader Yulang Hou Duotong, and gave him riches, agreed to set up county officials in the local area and his son as the county order, Yulang Hou thought that his country was far away from the Han Dynasty, so he agreed for the time being, but then repeatedly disobeyed Han, so he had the phrase "Han and I are big", which became an allusion to the
When the T7606/7607 T7608/7605 express train opened, the EMU train had been changed to the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway, so the train did not need to wait for the EMU train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, and the Chizhou-Shanghai section took only 7 hours and 13 minutes, but due to the low standard of the Ningtong Railway, the average speed of the train was still less than 80 km/h, and there was still no speed advantage compared with the same line of highway passenger traffic, plus the train was inextricably linked with the T7776/7777 T7778/7775 train, so railway enthusiasts continued the "Shanghai-Chi special slow" joke to this train, after the train was extended to the east to the station, there was a new joke "Shanghai-East special slow", but there are still many railway
Traditional digital modulation and division of labor uses frequency division division to transmit different information through different frequency bands, OFDM divides an entire frequency band into several sub-carriers, and makes each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap each other in the frequency spectrum, can reduce interference, it works by placing the signal in the frequency domain at the transmitting end, through the inverse Fourier transform (IDFT) to the time domain, and by adding a cyclic prefix after transmission, while the receiving end is to remove the cyclic prefix, and then the time domain signal through the Fourier transform (DFT) to convert the message back to the frequency domain, to solve the original transmission signal.

Claude Auchinleck's own plans were in much the same direction as Montgomerie's, but he also had a series of contingency plans to deal with a breach of the line, including the defence of Alexandria and Cairo, which led to disagreements between commanders over whether to defend El Alamein or retreat (as had been the case at the end of June with regard to the defence of Matrouh), and Montgomerie's simplification of other options and emphasis on holding his chosen area at all costs influenced him to explain his intentions to his superiors and to deploy units to the front circle (such as the British 44th Infantry Division), which had previously been reserved for contingency planning.

However, Japanese DIY gamer consumers are difficult to connect with manufacturers around Shenzhen due to language and other factors, and are unable to review factory quality and contact demand, and this company creates value in Japan on behalf of this segment.
Since the highways connecting the two sides of the coastal mountain range are only Guangfeng Highway (Taiwan 11A), Ruigang Highway (Hua 64), and Dongfu Highway (Taiwan 23), there are only three highways connecting Taiwan 9 and Taiwan 11. For the distance between Mizuho and Furi, there is only one highway that can lead to Taiwan 11 at a distance of 64 kilometers. Therefore, in July 1997, the General Administration of Highways started the "New Construction Plan for the Yuli-Changbin Section Highway" to solve the traffic inconvenience, which can reduce the driving time to 2 hours before the opening of the highway, and to 30 minutes after the opening of the highway, which can increase local development and provide a quick emergency line for medical treatment.

The early description of Cryptomycota as parasitic on the surface of the host cell, lacking a cell wall, morphologically similar to a kettle fungus, with atypical morphology and intracellular parasitic life history, but this classification has a number of shortcomings, the etymology of the word "hidden" means that such organisms have long been ignored by researchers, until the advent of molecular sequence analysis to uncover the mystery, but this feature applies to many other eukaryotes, is not exclusive to Cryptomycota, and there is room for discussion as to whether the genus Rhodes is representative, because the life history of Cryptomycota is still poorly understood, it is not clear whether most species can have both cell surface parasitic and intracellular parasitic life forms, so the morphology and life history of Rhodes is not necessarily atypical.

Lawyers may defend anyone, even if the person being defended is guilty of a heinous crime and the evidence against him is clear. All persons accused of a criminal offence, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or whether the evidence against them is clear or not, have the right to seek the assistance of a lawyer. However, this does not mean that lawyers are inherently evil or have no moral conscience, as this is part of their duties. However, there is a culture of jokes and satire against lawyers in society because of the image of some of the people they defend, the arguments they use in their defence, and the fact that some lawyers are unscrupulous, unprincipled and charge high fees.

Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when 25-28 genes are deleted from the long arm of chromosome 7, usually by chance during the formation of an egg or sperm; in a small number of cases, Williams syndrome is inherited from an autodominant parent (somatic dominant disease); the patient's distinctive facial features (wide mouth, upturned nose, medium-length, narrow and small chin, bubble eyes, pointed ears, long neck, sloping shoulders, etc.) are often thought to be missing specific genes, and the diagnosis is usually based on symptoms that raise suspicion (e.g., birth with heart valve atresia, aortic stenosis, SVAS, etc.) and is confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ELN gene probe testing.

Because fantasy novels are mostly written from the Internet, published on the Internet at the same time, and often change their style in the course of serialization to adapt to the audience (because of the possibility of instantaneous comments, so more like the audience than the reader), these changes may make the content of the novel often inconsistent phenomenon, but as long as the plot arrangement is brilliant and reasonable, do not deliberately distinguish between the categories of works, but also the thematic weight of the chapters as a distinction, if the thematic scope of each chapter in the fictional world and only add a few other non-traditional plots, can be classified as fantasy novels; if the chapters revolve around martial arts, science fiction and magic only as an embellishment, it is more recognized as fantasy novels.

Whenever there is a large-scale disaster (such as the emergence of epidemics), rolls of toilet paper is very easy to be snapped up, some analysts believe that due to the Western countries or areas that advocate Western civilization will be quite large consumption of toilet paper; due to the future development of the disaster is unclear (including the governing government's response to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.), may lead to long-term isolation, and people increase the stock of various materials; rolls of toilet paper in the store is a large space and conspicuous goods, too fast to buy the shelves easy to empty the situation, will further aggravate people's fear of material shortages and fear of missing out on the psychology, and ultimately make it difficult for stores to replenish the shelves to keep up with the speed of people to buy.
This is not reasonable, because a good nib is often a high-grade pen and has a certain weight, and secondly, when writing, you need to force the nib to make a coarse effect, but the ballpoint pen only although the paper on the soft material to write, can also do, the ballpoint pen is often better for the hard pen calligraphy effect, play more space, but to have a certain degree of understanding of different writing techniques, the need for the pen holder to have more observation, pen calligraphy needs is speed, because the water-based ink nib writing can not write too slow and stop at a point too long, this alone is far less than the ballpoint pen to light, the only advantage of the pen is that the ink color is brighter than the ballpoint pen.
The surface speed of diesel-powered U-boats is not high, can only catch up with some slow merchant ships, and the maximum speed underwater is less than 10 knots, generally about 4 knots (except for the Type XXI, which is equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and streamlined hull design, can operate at an unprecedented high speed of 17 knots underwater for an hour), in contrast, the maximum speed of destroyers is 30 knots, the actual anti-submarine warfare due to the need to use active sonar and hydrophones (Hydraphone), the ship speed is generally still 10-15 knots, U-boats underwater in the face of enemy destroyers depth charges are difficult to evade, the lack of mobility is a fatal disadvantage of U-boats.

The first chapter
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a good man.
His family lives in a little-known northern town, if Beijing intends to build a twenty-thirty ring can barely be considered the foot of the Son of Heaven, if the world's good people card according to the harmonic count on his head can barely be considered the world's famous, walking on the road no one knows, in addition to a bit of masculinity in addition to how to look at the ordinary square face after more than twenty years, the goal of life is to be a good person, in addition to no characteristics - this is him.
Although the weather is cooler in the north, walking on the road in the sun during the day can be very irritating, so you can see all kinds of vehicles running everywhere in the busy city center, but you can't see many pedestrians walking outside, and a tall young man wearing a white T-shirt, gray pants, and an ordinary face is one of the few pedestrians.
Hao Ren felt that this year's students more and more unprofessional, when he was working outside the folds would never give a glance can be seen to be single gentlemen in the hands of this kind of thing, but in any case, this kind of hard folding fan is quite appropriate.
"The last two, not even." Hao Ren muttered looking at the last two job ads in his hand, fortunately these two places are next to each other, he can quickly handle today's "task", and one of them is in front, is an advertising company from the outside absolutely can not see how much strength, but the sign on the door is loud ah: Galaxy Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company, the name is a half-year must fall goods, Hao Ren was rushed to this name, the main purpose is not to apply for a job, is to see how strange the boss of the company can come up with such a magical name.
He walked enthusiastically for several hundred meters to get around the barrier of the road, and then ran in the sun to the door of the advertising company with the special name of Niu X, and was surprised to find that the company had indeed closed down, the sign on the door was still hanging, but the glass door was affixed with a closing notice, the date was two days ago, and the job announcement in his hand was four days ago.
By the way, the advertising company's job announcement rubbed into a ball and tossed it into the trash can on the side of the road, Hao Ren looked down at the last one, and two seconds later it also rubbed into a ball and tossed it into the same place, by the way, reflecting on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago - the bus company is looking for an office clerk, 25 to 40 years old, able to work hard and understand the computer work experience is preferred, gender female.
Clutching it in his hand, he made his way to the center of the city to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising agency, which had been busy hiring two days before it closed, were.
Hao Ren, sex male, love female, age 25, no ** hobby, the advantage is not fussy eaters, currently single, few friends and relatives, he lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city south of the city, like most young men, his goal in life is to achieve a monthly income of more than ten thousand at the age of twenty-five, marry a beautiful daughter-in-law, if you can, it is best to have a car, parents are no way to filial piety, so at least he has to live well enough not to disgrace the family, now this series of life goals have been completed a third: he is twenty-five this year.
It's such a sad story.
He had come to the city today to look for work, but he had no pressing personal need for a source of livelihood: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lived in an old house left by his parents, thanks to the legacy of the older generation. At least the house was quite large -- it was a two-story old-fashioned house that had been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been renting out a house to make a living, but because the place where he lives is really remote, even remote enough to wait for the demolition of the old house, I'm afraid it will take several ten-year plans.
To be sure, with such a stable income, Hao Ren did not need to come out to find a job, but this person, too long idle time is a bit affective, always feel that he should make a little effort to open up the path of life, coupled with more important reasons - his old house is too far away, to the extent that it is almost out of human civilization, since the last migrant couple have moved away from the rental house, no one has come to rent a house for half a year, looking at the two-story "apartment" empty for several months, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart: unless the municipal planning is tilted towards his side, or if he wants to live, I'm afraid he really can only come out to find a job.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought it was unlikely that the area around his home would turn into a commercial center overnight, and considering that he could not waste himself as an old man, he finally decided to find a job first, at least to have an income to live on.
How to say that he was also a part-time job to earn tuition hard-working good man, Lang Lang Qiankun can still starve himself to death?
But fate does not depend on the will of man, and his first day of running around outside was basically . . . only running around.
It was no use thinking about it so much. Hao Ren stretched himself and decided to rest under the shade of a bench in a small park on the side of the road, wait for the hottest hour of the day, and then find a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then take the bus home.
He found a piece of paper to wipe down the bench, then lay down on it, covering his face from the sun with the fold-out sheet with the logo of the women's hospital and the pretty girl, and rested unconcernedly.
But he had not been lying down for what seemed like a minute when the sunlight that filtered through the edges of the folds began to fade, as if someone had come to him. Hao Ren's face was slightly surprised to see that the sun was setting on the horizon, and a small, slender female figure was standing next to him. The figure was just blocking out the sinking sun, for it was not clear what the woman looked like against the light, and it was only through a faint outline that she could be identified as a slim girl with short hair.
"You, are you awake?
The strange girl seemed at last to realize that her position against the light made it difficult to see her, so she grinned and turned slightly to the side so that she could be seen.
A very beautiful girl - this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This self-acquainted girl with a shawl of short hair, may be very fond of sports, the skin with a slight wheat color, healthy and full of sunshine, her appearance is beautiful, the most attention is that a pair of smart eyes, more than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen full of vitality, as if the whole person's spirit should come out of these eyes.
Behind her was a large suitcase that seemed to carry a lot of weight.
Looking at Hao Ren, who was a little stunned, the pretty girl with short hair broke out into an all-time brilliant giggle (although it seems a little inappropriate to say so, but Hao Ren really thought it was a giggle), a smile so clean and pure that it seems to be rare to see it on the faces of girls of the same age these days. The other party fumbled around in his small bag for a long time, and finally pulled out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: "Excuse me, do you know where this place is?
Hao Ren patted his face to sober himself up, regardless of the impetuous girl is what is going on, but looked down at the address on the paper. . . you I go to this is not my own home?
Part 1, Chapter 1
The early morning light pierced the ink-blue sky, the vast expanse of the sky, white with fish belly.
Xianyu County, Wuzong Academy, in the back of the mountain forest, a skinny young man in a loose martial arts robe, double-disc squatting, the tip of the tongue against the teeth, the whole body concentrated on the right and left two punches, pounding people thick trees.
Smooth boxing, easy to put away, internal strength without spitting, hard with soft, has a bit of fire.
The boy's name is Su Yu, fourteen years old, beautiful and handsome, tall, childish.
Black hair, a pair of eyes as vast as the stars, as deep as the ancient starry sky, showing a wisdom that does not match the age.
Three hours later, the sun was high in the sky.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at the blood-stained fists, and sighed softly: "I work twice as hard as others, but the results are less than half of the best qualified. "
"To come to the other world, I really don't know, is it a blessing or a curse? "
Two months ago, Su Yu was on a plane when it crashed. When he woke up, he found that he had crossed into a world called the Land of the Moon.
Become a student of a Wuzong school in the mainland.
It took him two months to digest the memory of his former master.
Shenyue continent, to the martial arts, the jungle, cruel and strict.
Human beings cultivate martial arts, reach the pinnacle of excellence, and reach the realm of transcendence and holiness.
Budo is divided into nine weights, each of which has three levels: Xiaocheng, Dacheng, and Pinnacle.
Beyond the ninefold martial arts, break the shackles, a leap into a god, become a mythical figure, known as the "holy king of the world. "
The realm of the holy king on earth is the ultimate of martial arts and the limit of the pursuit of hundreds of millions of human beings.
Rumor has it that the holy king of the world can move mountains and reclamate the sea, lift clouds and drive fog, omnipotent.
An earthly holy king, enough to change the fortune of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a god-like being.
However, how difficult is cultivation in the world?
Su Yu was the supreme genius of Qingshan Town, under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At the age of only 14, he cultivated to the pinnacle of martial arts and became a century-old wonder in the eyes of everyone in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was admitted to the Wuzong Academy in Xianyu County, above all else, Su Yu discovered what a frog he had been at the bottom of the well.
Wuzong Academy, a search for all the talents of Xianyu County, once a year.
And he, among all the geniuses of the Wuzong Academy, is only the bottom!
Wuzong University divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden students, elite-level geniuses, are often the best in a city, and the top geniuses who suppress the rest of the geniuses in the city are given priority training by the Wuzong Academy.
Silver students, potential-level geniuses, in small towns, have superior talent, and with a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu, who is a silver student, knows very well that, in fact, a silver student is one who has no hope of cultivating to great success, but it is a pity to give up, and it is a pity to give up tasteless food, like chicken ribs.
Silver students are not favored, and the cultivation resources given by universities are very limited, and the possibility of getting ahead is close to zero.
"Su Yu, quickly return to the university, the Duke of Qin summoned you!" An urgent voice, cutting through the silence of the mountains, a blue-clad middle-aged man ran up the mountain panting, his face a little anxious.
Impatient, the middle-aged man in blue stepped forward and buckled Su Yu's shoulders, grasping him quickly down the mountain, regardless of hurting Su Yu's thin body.
Su Yu gritted his teeth, endured a sharp pain in his shoulder, and was silent.
Blue, middle-aged, is the deacon of the school, who manages the daily student activities and, in the words of the Earth School, is the director of instruction.
After half a cup of tea.
The Academy, a luxurious and elegant, sophisticated as a dream lounge.
Only core students, high-ranking members of the university, and dignitaries can rest here. In addition, gold and silver students are not eligible.
Su Yu is also the first time to come to the luxury lounge, ordinary poor boy to come here, may be nervous. But Su Yu, a former life is the business elite, five-star hotel, presidential suite, luxury ball, is a regular guest, calm state of mind, pampered.
In the lounge, there were three people, a pair of young men and women, a noble temperament, dignified man.
Su Yu paused for a moment as her eyes swept over the fourteen-year-old girl.
It was a woman with a pretty face like an elf, a jade face as delicate as a sculpture, a skin as white as the snow in the spring, a delicate figure, dressed in a spotless white dress, like a fox fairy, very beautiful.
However, she looked at Su Yu's eyes, there was a cold, but also a hint of complexity.
At his side was a sixteen-year-old boy, bright, handsome, and precious.
"Oh, I'm the Duke of Qin, and I'm glad to see you."The Duke of Qin, one of the three Dukes of the Fenglin Empire, did not have any arrogance at this time, but was very kind, and asked Su Yu to sit down with a smile.
Su Yu shook his head coldly, unmoved by the cordiality.
People in high positions, attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so pay great attention to their own recuperation, their own image.
Just like the politicians on the earth, clearly make a fuss, but after meeting, still shake hands and greetings, full of smiles, only under the table to stab, under the black hand.
"I am Qin Feng's father, and I have come here for his affair with Qinger."The Duke of Qin had a handsome face and a warm smile. "I have heard what Fenger said, and I apologize to you as Fenger's father."
Su Yu's heart flashed bitterness, the bitterness of another Su Yu's remnant soul. The girl in front of her, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu, and at the same time was included as a student of the Wuzong Academy.
Two green plums and bamboo horses, two small no-guess, golden boy and jade girl, a pair made in heaven.
However, after entering the Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small village, was shocked by the huge and bustling world, and gradually became intoxicated in the world of glitz.
With her fox-like beauty, it is difficult to avoid being sought after by young magnates, Junjie genius.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and accompany Su Yu through her first year of school.
But, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, from a naive little girl, gradually metamorphosed, knowing that Su Yu after it is difficult to have a future, following her, is likely to suffer and be reduced to a subhuman.
Finally, her inner defenses were lax.
Two months ago, he completely broke off relations with Su Yu and became the partner of Qin Feng, the son of the Duke of Qin.
Although Jiang Xueqing adheres to the duty of a good girl, has never usurped the relationship between men and women, but since then, the two often accompany, inseparable, become the envy of everyone in the eyes of the immortal couple.
Su Yu, on the other hand, became the laughing stock of the Wuzong Academy.
Su Yu was hit hard, many times begged Jiang Xueqing to change his mind, did not hesitate to kneel and beg, lost face, but Jiang Xueqing coldly refused.
Su Yu could not bear the tragedy of life, threw himself into the lake, and it happened that Su Yu of the earth had an air crash, and his soul passed through to him, a sad and pathetic weak person.
The Duke of Qin saw that Su Yu fell into memory, only when he was difficult to give up his friendship with Jiang Xueqing, sighed: "Feng Er is young and ignorant, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what you want, do not hesitate to mention, but, as a father, I hope you can complete Feng Er, he is serious about Xueqing girl. "
Listening to the words of the Duke of Qin seemingly from the heart, Su Yu secretly shook his head, this trick, to deceive ordinary people can also, to him useless.
Robbed my girlfriend, and let me complete? Where is this to apologize, it is clear that the pressure!
The Duke of Qin seemed to have a mild attitude, but it was full of blatant insults.
Just ask, if it is the woman of the king, the woman of the emperor, who is favored by his son, he, the Duke of Qin, dares to let the king give up his woman to Qin Feng? He dares not, because he can't afford to provoke the king, he can only afford to provoke a commoner like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head faintly and got up to leave. He had no nostalgia for such a realistic girl as Jiang Xueqing, and even if the Duke of Qin did not pressure people, he had no intention of competing for her.
As for the so-called compensation of the Duke of Qin, although Su Yu lacks resources for cultivation, although he is a poor boy, although he has nothing, he still has a will not to accept defeat, and has not been reduced to the point of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understood the "Su Yu" character, stubborn and unconvinced, and saw that he wanted to leave, but when he still refused to give up, the silver teeth gently bit, the lotus step gently moved, the snow eyes like the cold moon: "Su Yu, please respect my choice!"
"Now that I've come to this day, I'm going to say it completely, and I hope you can die." Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed cold.
"Qin Fenggui is a small prince and will be a pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me glory and wealth. Can you give me a poor boy from a mountain village?"
"Qin Feng is respected as a gold student, and will later catch up with the holy king of the world, standing above hundreds of millions of people, can give me a sense of security, you a silver student, can you give it?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality, I do not deny that once you were my attachment, is the most dazzling genius in my mind, but, that is I am too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and true, I have no choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in his eyes, stared at Su Yu's eyes, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, and sighed softly: "Feng Ge people are very good, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Rongling Baodan, promote cultivation, your strength has improved, and your days at school will be much better."
Thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized, crystal-carved statue of a woman from his sleeve.
The most beautiful thing is that the woman of the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful, so enchanting.
The statue of a woman, lifelike, and holding its owner, Jiang Xueqing, generally indistinguishable.
"This is the love gift you gave me, now, give it back to you, and we will never owe each other again." Jiang Xueqing, mercilessly stuffed the statue in Su Yu's hands, turned back to Qin Feng's side, looked out at the sky, no longer looked at Su Yu, ruthless.
"Chi Yao, I treat you like a dear, why do you want to kill me? "
Zhang Ruo dust yelled, wanted to pounce, pressed the gold casting of the bed "creak" a sound, suddenly sat up.
Finding it was just a dream, Zhang Ruodust took a long breath and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.
Oh, no!
It was not a dream!
What happened to him and Princess Chi Yao, how could it be a dream?
Zhang Ruodust was the only son of Emperor Ming, one of the Nine Great Emperors of Kunlun. At the age of 16, he cultivated to the Great Consummation of the Celestial Realm with an anti-heavenly physique.
However, just as he became the first of the younger generation in Kunlun, he died at the hands of his fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chiyao is the daughter of the Qing Emperor, one of the nine emperors.
The Ming Emperor and the Qing Emperor were the best of friends, and Zhang Ruodust and Princess Chiyao were married to each other, growing up together and cultivating together.
A dashing, a beautiful, can be called a golden girl, could have become a good story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruo dust could not have expected that Princess Chiyao would actually attack him!
After dying at the hands of Princess Chiyao, when Zhang Ruodust woke up again, he found that he had been eight hundred years later.
Once Princess Chiyao, she pacified the Nine Emperors' Rebellion, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the ruler of the entire Kunlun realm - Empress Chiyao.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors of Kunlun became a thing of the past and disappeared into the long river of history.
The Nine Emperors are dead, and the Empress stands.
In this era, there is only one emperor, that is, Empress Chi Yao, who reigns over the world and reigns in all directions.
"Why did she kill me?
How can her heart be so hard, or is it that women's hearts are so hard?Zhang Ruodust's eyes were sharp, his heart was heavy as iron, and he was full of questions, but no one could help him answer them.
Eight hundred years have passed, the sea has long been vicissitudes, things are wrong, in addition to the cultivation of the world-famous Empress Chi Yao, youth is still the same, not old and not dead.
All of those who have died have been turned into loess and white bones. Even the Nine Emperors, who were so majestic in those days, have all disappeared from the human world, leaving only a glorious story to be recited for generations to come.
Squeak!
A frail woman in a palace dress, from the outside, pushed the door in, looked at Zhang Ruo dust sitting on the bed, with a concerned look, "dust, you have nightmares again? "
In front of this beautiful woman, she is the princess of the king of Yunwu County, but also Zhang Ruo dust's mother, Princess Lin.
The original owner of the body, who was sickly, had died in his bed three days before.
After Zhang Ruodust was killed by Princess Chiyao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the sick teenager back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body, also called Zhang Ruodust, Zhang Ruodust just woke up, but also very repulsive to Concubine Lin.
After all, in the eyes of Zhang Ruodust, Concubine Lin, is just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruodust gradually found that Concubine Lin really cares about him, almost meticulously, to see Zhang Ruodust nightmares were frightened to wake up, but also in spite of the cold, immediately rushed to Zhang Ruodust's room.
In his last life, Zhang Ruodust never met his birth mother, and it is said that she died when he was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body, even let him have a mother, feel the warmth of motherly love. "Perhaps she did not know that her own dust, three days ago, died of illness!"
If she had been told the truth, she might not have been able to withstand the shock of the bad news.
Zhang Ruodust looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and smiled: "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream. "
Concubine Lin's thin body draped in a jujube-red hooded mink, sitting on the edge of Zhang Ruodust's bed, stroking Zhang Ruodust's forehead, worried: "It has been three nights, you are always woken up by nightmares, each time called the name of 'Chi Yao'. Who the hell is she?"
Concubine Lin naturally could not associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after the unification of the Kunlun border and the establishment of the First Central Empire, Empress Chiyao was known as the "Dawei Dade Holy Empress", and no one dared to mention the word "Chiyao" at all.
Zhang Ruodust said, "Nothing, mother, you heard wrong!"
Concubine Lin sighed and said, "Never call out the word 'Chi Yao' again, not even in a dream. That is the name of the empress. Calling out the name of the empress is disrespectful and will be put to death if it is heard by someone with a heart."
Zhang Ruodust nodded, squeezed his fingers tightly, and said, "Absolutely not!"
In the future, I will be her nightmare.
She looked at Zhang Ruodust, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, her heart incomparably sour.
Although born in the county king's house, but he has been sickly since childhood, has been sixteen years old, still can only lie in bed all year round, I'm afraid this life can only be like this!
There was a knock at the door.
"What are you doing?"
A beautiful-looking maid, trying to stop the intruder Hachioji, but was gently pushed by Hachioji, fell more than ten meters away. Hachioji was a warrior, cultivation to reach the end of the Yellow Pole, a single blow, enough to knock a 300-pound stone plate out of the distance, not to mention only a 100-pound maid?
With a flick of the finger, she could be catapulted out.
The maid gave a terrible cry and fell heavily to the ground, breaking her left arm.
The Eighth Prince, dressed in a wispy robe and a jade belt around his waist, with a strong body, slender arms and a steady pace, entered the Jade Palace and gave the maid a cold stare.
Behind the eight princes, followed by six bodyguards in linskin armor, tall, tiger-backed and bear-waisted, are obviously powerful martial monks, belonging to the palace guard.
She closed the door behind her and went out.
She stared at Hachioji standing outside, frowned slightly, and said, "Your Highness, Hachioji, this is the Yushu Palace, even if you are a prince, you can't break into it! "
Zhang Ji, the Eighth Prince, looked up at Concubine Lin and said aloud, "The Queen has ordered that the sleeping quarters of Concubine Lin's mother and her ninth brother be changed to the Ziyi Partial Hall. In the future, the owner of the Yushu Palace will be Concubine Xiao, the mother of this Prince."
She had expected this day to come, but she had not expected it to come so soon.
Concubine Lin smiled miserably and said, "Is the Queen going to drive our mother and son out of the Yushu Palace so soon?
My mother said that she would like to be stationed in the Yushu Palace tonight. Please, Concubine Lin’s mother, move to the main hall now!
The Eighth Prince smiled coldly and said, "Concubine Lin, there are a lot of poor people in the world, but not everyone deserves to be pitied. Since the ninth brother is sickly, what is he doing in the world?"
He's your ninth brother!
She wanted to say something more, and suddenly the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruodust's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hand on the doorpost, staring at the Hachioji not far away.
His seemingly weak body, as if containing an indomitable will, said: "Don't ask them, we will move away now. "
"Dust, how did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, so don't go back soon." Concubine Lin hurriedly went to help Zhang Ruodust, for fear that he would catch the wind and cold.
She looked at him, and he looked at her, and she looked at him, and he looked at her.
Concubine Lin and Shen helped Zhang Ruo dust, step by step out of the Yushu Palace, except for the one handmaid who was pushed out by the Eight Princes and broke her arm.
None of the other servants followed them out of the palace, and it was obvious to all that Princess Lin and the Nine Princes had completely lost their power, and there was no place for them in the palace.
They had been servants of the Yushu Palace, but now they had chosen wisely to stay in the Yushu Palace, and all of them had gone to ingratiate themselves with the new master, Hachio.
Ziyi partial hall, is generally out of favor of the princess living place, very remote, full of leaves, it seems to have been a long time no one lived.
It was late at night and the wind was cold.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruo dust emaciated body wrapped in a coat, but still feel the cold.
"This body is too weak, and only by cultivating martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I were the son of the king of the county, I would still be at the mercy of others.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruodust does not know where he can go now?
Since God had arranged for him to be reborn in this body, he had to be strong, both for the sake of his future vengeance against Empress Chiyao and for the sake of his mother, who took good care of him. The humiliation and indifference he suffered today were all due to the fact that he was too weak to resist, unable to control his own destiny, and even the place where he lived had been usurped by others.
If you want to be respected by others, if you want to get a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your ability.
In Kunlun, if you want to become a warrior, you must first open the "Mark of Shenwu".
The so-called "Mark of Shenwu" is the qualification given by the gods to human beings to practice martial arts.
Those who have not opened the Seal of Shenwu will never be able to cultivate their true qi and become strong between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruodust is 16 years old and still has not opened the Seal of Shenwu.
After the age of sixteen, he missed the best age to cultivate martial arts, and even if he opened the "Mark of Shenwu", he could not achieve much.
They are also the sons of the King of Yunwu County. Why can the Eight Princes be superior? Can they drive Zhang Ruodust and Concubine Lin out of Yushu Palace?
It is because, at the age of ten, Hachioji opened the "Mark of Shenwu" and is now a young warrior in the late Huangji period.
"As long as I open the Seal of Shenwu, I will be able to cultivate the Nine Heavenly Ming Emperor Sutra.
With the mystery of the Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra, even if I have missed the best age for cultivation, it is still possible for me to catch up with other geniuses and become a strong martial artist again.The Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra is the supreme treasure of the Ming Emperor's cultivation. Apart from the Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruodu knows the complete cultivation method of the Nine-Day Ming Emperor Sutra.
"Tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony, and I hope to be recognized by the gods and open the 'Shenwu Seal'."
Zhang Ruodust clenched his fists, full of desire to open the "Mark of Shenwu".
After tidying up the room, Concubine Lin came to help Zhang Ruodust, "Dust, you have to rest early! Tomorrow, you have to go to the sacrifice ceremony. "
"Don't worry, I will certainly be able to open the 'Mark of Shenwu' tomorrow! " Zhang Ruodu said.
"Well, that's it.
She looked at Zhang Ruo dust deeply, and sighed softly in her heart.
The first chapter
A rusty iron gate was opened, and the sound of the iron gate was blocked back by the ancient buildings around it.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out of the iron gate by the arms of two jailers. The young man with a drooping head did not seem to be breathing, and even his arms were emaciated to the bone. The blood-stained rags on his body showed how the young man had been beaten and tortured.
The emaciated man was thrown to the ground by two jailers, spattered with dust, and then remained motionless.
"Isn't this boy supposed to be dead? " asked a stout jailer, staring at the young man, who was lying motionless on the ground.
The other jailer huffed, "He must be dead, and who dared to be rude to Miss Jane when he didn't know what to do with his life? It's better now, not only that Ningfu has been destroyed, but that he himself has been freed and deserves it."
"Be careful what you say, old man, and we'll drag him out and deal with him," the stout jailer hastily admonished.
Hearing the stout jailer's words, the other jailer, called the old club, involuntarily winced his head, and went to pull up the man who had no breath on the ground, ready to be dragged away.
Just then, a soft voice called out, "Two big brothers, I want to take my husband away. "
The two talking jailers then saw a woman in a coarse linen dress standing to one side, and although she was dressed in coarse linen, she was still vaguely recognisable. The only regret was that her face was so disfigured that it was obscured by her slightly dishevelled hair, which made it impossible to take a second look at her.
Both jailers recognized the woman as one of the two surviving members of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the housekeeper of Ningfu, and when Ningfu was raided, he had an accident outside Cangqin, so he escaped. The woman was Ningfu's daughter-in-law, and the wife of the emaciated man who had just been thrown out of prison.
Of course, it was also because Ji Luofei was not related to the Ning family, and she had married into the Ning family because the Ning family and the Ji family were related, and she and Ningcheng had been married since childhood. However, the Ji family declined in the most inexplicable way, and in the end only a disfigured Ji Luofei was left.
Even so, Ningcheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Princess Jiluo into his house, ready to wait for Ningcheng to really gather his strength, and then let the two marry.
"All right, all right, drag it away, and leave it here unsightly," said the stout jailer, waving his hand impatiently as he collected the silver.
They were about to dispose of Ningcheng's body, but they didn't expect anyone to come and dispose of it, and they were offered silver coins, which was a good thing, of course, they wouldn't refuse.
Hearing this, Ji Luofei hurriedly picked up Ningcheng, accelerated her speed, and soon disappeared from the prison door.
"If she is not disfigured, she is beautiful," said another jailer in a judgmental tone, tossing the silver coin in his hand as he looked at her back.
"Don't talk nonsense, that Jiluo concubine is also a member of the Cangqin Erxing Courtyard, and even if she is ugly, it will not be our turn." The chubby jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder and led him into the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled a very good fragrance, and when he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted that he was being carried by a woman, and that the fragrance was coming from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood, and as a result, he went the wrong way, and went to the high ledge alone. Then a yellow mang from the sky hit him, and then there was no more.
Is he not dead? What the hell is going on here?
Ning Xiaocheng just thought of it, all kinds of information crowded into his mind, he was actually reborn.
To the astonishment of Ning Xiaocheng, his reborn body was originally called Ningcheng. He was astonished because his original name was also Ningcheng.
It was only because he often had a nightmare that he saw himself in a very strange place, where he was secretly imprisoned and tortured to death. Although it was only a dream, Ningcheng changed his name to Ningxiaocheng.
Unexpectedly turned around, he still called Ningcheng, and really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman behind him looked back and did not say much.
"I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk," Ning Xiaocheng said apologetically as the woman looked back at herself.
"The Ning family is gone, and you're lucky to be alive." The woman's voice was calm, as if she had been calm even if Ning Xiaocheng was really dead.
Ning Xiaocheng was silent, he had just sorted out some bits and pieces of information, he should now call back to Ningcheng again, is the Cangqin state of the Ning family alone.
Ningcheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to look for spiritual objects when he was very young, and they never came back. Ningcheng has been living with his grandfather, Ning Hongchang, in Cangle City, the capital of the Cangqin Kingdom.
Ningcheng, of course, became the first person in Ningfu, and Ning Hongchang never paid any attention to Ningcheng. All the bad things that Ningcheng did in Cangle were taken down by Ning Hongchang. Cangle was full of princes and nobles, and although Ning Hongchang was also the elder statesman of Cangqin, he was worse than those princes and nobles.
Finally, one day, Ningcheng provoked a basket that even he could not carry, and he actually offended Jian Sujie, the apple of the eye of the Jian family in the State of Cangqin, not to say that the Jian family was not able to provoke the Ning family, even Qiu Yingguang, the fiancé of Jian Sujie, was not able to provoke the Ning family.
Ningcheng thought of this and sighed. The result he could not afford was, of course, that he was put in prison, and his grandfather, Ning Hongchang, exhausted his connections and family wealth in order to save him. As a result, he was not saved, but the whole Ning family was put in. This news was also learned by his predecessor from the mouth of the jailer, and it can be said that the Ning family was also destroyed because of him.
After Ningcheng sorted out these things, he sighed again in his heart. There is no reason in this world. Whoever has a big fist is the reason.
At the same time, he realized who the person behind his back was, and that the disfigured woman was his fiancée, Princess Jiro, something like a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably fell, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luo Concubine, but Ningcheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luo Concubine to the Ning family, ready to help the two get married when Ningcheng gathered strength.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ningcheng in other matters, but when it came to marrying Concubine Jiluo, he would never give in. The original Ningcheng was very unhappy with the disfigured Concubine Jiluo, and often scolded her. Fortunately, Concubine Jiluo was obedient and never refuted anything to Ningcheng. Moreover, unlike Ningcheng, Concubine Jiluo had qualifications and could cultivate.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Second Star Court of Cangqin, and was already a monk with three levels of concentration. In Cangqin, anyone who could cultivate was called a monk.
By this time, Princess Jiro had carried him into a very low black stone house, which, though low, was not very small, at least as it should be. There was even a small courtyard with a deep well in it.
Even if it was about him, Ningcheng had to find out. Although he guessed that the Janes and the Qiu's had done it, he had to find out more.
"Why do you ask me what you have done yourself?" Ji Luofei answered simply, and put Ningcheng down.
Then she poured a glass of water and fed Ningcheng, and said, "I'll boil water for you to bathe, and forget some things, you know it's not good for you. "
Ningcheng watched Jiluofei go in to boil water, but did not continue to ask, he understood Jiluofei's meaning. With his ability, the more he knew, the faster he would die.
I don't know if Ji Luofei added something to that glass of water, Ningcheng felt that after drinking this glass of water, the whole person regained some strength.
Ningcheng sat on the old wooden couch, thinking of his own situation for a moment, and then of his sister Ning Ruoran. At the same time, he really did not understand why Tian Muwan would do that to him. According to what he knew about Tian Muwan, Tian Muwan was definitely not a snobbish girl.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Chu away from the boat on the lake, the lake breeze on the face, refreshing.
The Duke of Yiguo is a huge lake with ninety-nine islands, and the distance between the Hall of Performing Arts and the East Garden is eighteen miles.
On top of the boat, he was medium-sized, a green shirt fluttering, ordinary-looking but quite heroic, looking at the vast expanse of the lake, his thoughts drifting away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days. Nineteen years, two months and three days!
High-energy physics researcher with a bright future, a great scientist in the future, a small mistake in the experiment, the explosion later to this world, reincarnation and re-incarnation!
A muffled noise broke his reverie, and he turned his head to see a glittering carp pulsating in the boat.
Chuli shook his head and bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. Straightening up, a tall building came into view.
The 100-meter-high building, shimmering bronze light, heavy and solemn, showing the majesty of the principality.
This bronze tower is the Hall of Performing Arts!
In front of the Hall of Performing Arts is an open martial arts training ground, red mud floor, hundreds of people are practicing, or practicing swords, swords, fists, or each other, lively.
Chu away from the boat ashore, set foot on the martial arts field, did not walk a few steps, suddenly flashed a handsome young man, face like a crown of jade, eyebrows like swords, flying.
He was a long man, Gao Chu away from a head, hugging his shoulders and looking down at him: "Chu, what are you doing here?! "
Chu frowns: "Get out of the way, good dogs don't get in the way!"
The handsome young man laughed and said, "Is it difficult for you to do martial arts? "
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued to walk: "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed, believe it or not you can't eat and walk around? "
Private fights are prohibited, fratricide is not allowed, and the guards are divided into escorts and bodyguards, one armed and one literate, both of which are strictly prohibited, and the light is reduced, the heavy is expelled from the house.
Chu away is not into the products of the guard, Zhuo Feiyang is the eight products of the guard, the guard to the guard is a bogey, he fell to the ground screaming, Zhuo Feiyang no matter how talented will also be heavily punished.
Zhuo Fei raised his sword and frowned: "Surname Chu, all right, shameless enough! " Chu left to go on.
Zhuo Feiyang side step out of the way, sullen handsome face: "The surname Chu, you can only use these small means! "
Chu said with a smile: "To deal with such a fool as you, small means are enough! "
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, his fists clenched tighter and tighter, as if the next moment to swing out, but Chu away lazily looked at him, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a bright smile and raised his hand vigorously: "Zhao Shimei! "
In the distance, a curvaceous and beautiful girl curled up, her skin race snow, apricot eyes willow eyebrows, temperament Chu Chu, gentle as water.
Chu away from the face slightly changed, Zhao Ying, with them at the same time into the house, beautiful, kind, gentle, is the kind of man will like to see the woman.
"Brother Zhuo?" Zhao Ying came over lightly, surprised: "Brother Chu?"
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought and smiled: "Zhao Shimei, long time no see. "
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he went to the library most of the time, wanting to change his fate with knowledge, and rarely came to the martial arts hall.
This time, I came to the Hall of Performing Arts because I was having problems with the cultivation of small cleansing pulse tips, and I wanted to take a look at the tips and cultivation notes related to small cleansing pulse tips.
Zhao Ying smiled and said, "Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a beautiful place. "
Chu smiled and nodded: "It's not bad."
East Garden directly belongs to the three Miss Xiao Qi's Yuqi Island, only he and Li Yue two bodyguards, not only leisurely, but also have the opportunity to see the three Miss, once the three Miss blue eyes, the sky is just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, the guy was lucky enough to get into the East Garden, God was too blind, he had to clean up after him!
"Zhao Shimei, don't take care of this waste, I just practiced to break the false sword yesterday, how about a discussion? "
Zhao Ying frowned and thought Zhuo Feiyang's speech was hard to hear.
"Well, don't say he's a waste! " Zhuo Feiyang hastily smiled and glanced at Chu away: "Even though he's a waste! "
Zhao Ying stared disapprovingly.
"Zhao Shimei, it doesn't matter, " Chu said with a smile. "There's no need to worry about such arrogant fools. "
"Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying said angrily.
Chu Li stretched out his hand to make a statement of surrender: "Zhao Shimei, come to the East Garden to play, the scenery is very beautiful, Brother Li's cooking is also excellent. "
"Well, what's there to see! "Zhuo Feiyang pursed his lips. "It's just flowers and plants. It's better to practice martial arts and play with things when you have that time. " "According to you, Miss Three and the Grand Duke are both play with things, not as good as you. " Chu seemed to laugh. The West Garden belonged to the Grand Duke Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Fei Yangjun blushed, sneered, and decided not to fight with him.
"Brother Zhuo!Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying's disgruntled anger said, "Will you stop for a while?...Brother Chu, I will go over and play, you have something to do first."
Chu away from a deep look at her: "Zhao Shimei, someone empty long a pair of good skin, a long time to see the heart of the people, Shimei do not easily trust others! "
What do you mean by Chu's name?
Chu ignored him and hugged Zhao Ying with a smile.
He turned and walked away.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy to keep up, and when he left, he took advantage of Zhao Ying's inattention and suddenly reached out his hand.
He almost slapped Chu away from the face, very confident Chu away from the time to avoid, seemingly inattentive, but it was the luck of the internal force, the speed is amazing.
Chu away from the light side of the head, Zhuo Feiyang fingertips brushed against the cheek, can feel the breeze, the power of this palm is not light.
'snap! '
The sound of a loud slap rang out.
Chu left palm slapped on his face, crisp and loud, not hard, very loud, and then quickly closed his hand.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned his head to look. Chu's expression did not change, as if the slap was not on his face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him with a sullen face. Chu Li smiled and touched his face: "It's really good kung fu, admire! "
She stared at him.
"Brother Zhuo--!" Zhao Ying sank down with a jade face.
Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed between his teeth, and said coldly, "I don't think Master Chu cares, do you, Master Chu?"
Chu turned his head and smiled: "Zhao Shimei, forget it. "
Zhao Ying looked at him sheepishly, hurriedly pulling Zhuo Feiyang away, and then stayed, the two of them had to fight!
Chu away stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back motionless, touched the fiery left side of her face, and started the large round mirror to suppress the mood swings.
If it is not the big round mirror wisdom, it is inevitable to be Zhuo Feiyang dark plan!
The world to honor the martial arts, from childhood deeply rooted in the concept of the heart, Zhao Ying gentle and kind, openly and secretly protect their own, let him quite moved.
But as a man, he needed a woman to protect him, and as a man, he couldn't bear it!
He walked through the crowd in the martial arts arena and into the martial arts hall.
He untied the wooden plaque from his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the temple. The young man's eyes were electric, and he glanced at it, indicating that he could enter.
Into his eyes were rows of bookshelves, and as he walked, he stopped by chance, reached out and pulled out a book, quickly turned it over, put it back and walked on, stopped again, and pulled out another book to turn it over.
In one hour he turned over twenty-two books.
As if he already knew the location of these books, straight over to pull out, in fact, he came for the first time, small washing pulse tips in the library to see.
The whole martial arts hall was in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of every book, clear and vivid.
He walked up to the second floor, went directly to the third row of bookshelves, and on the second floor, he pulled out the Shattered Sword Spectrum, turned it over, and then pulled out seven secret books, which were the cultivation tips of Shattered Sword Spectrum.
By the time he left the Hall of Performing Arts, he had imprinted in his mind thirty books of secret recipes, twenty-two books of notes on the cultivation of small pulse-cleansing techniques, one book on the cultivation of broken swords, and seven books on the cultivation of broken swords.
He drove the boat on the lake, the wind was blowing, the original anger had dissipated.
The thirty recipes in my mind began to melt together.
The midday sun was blazing, and he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a two-mile island, divided into flower beds, each with a rare flower, the whole island floating with the fragrance of flowers.
There was only one small courtyard on the island, and when Chu pushed the door into the courtyard, the shade came to his face, and a large tree covered half of the courtyard to drive away the heat.
He went into the West Chamber, came out with a green sword, and waved it in the middle of the courtyard, as slow as a Taiji sword, and for a moment there was a layer of sweat, and his forehead was bright.
He did not forget, he had seen the secret once imprinted on the mind, just learned from the performance of martial arts to break the sword is indeed amazingly powerful, but also very exhausting.
"Squeak. . . " came out of the main hall a strong young man, round cake big face, small eyes.
He staggered like a black bear, stretched twice, yawned twice, and then spoke lazily: "Brother, come back so early? "
Li Yue, the nine-pin guard, the two of them together in charge of the East Garden, good appetite, excellent cooking, good martial arts, but afraid of death not to break into the nine-pin building, willing to be a guard.
The guards and escorts of the Ducal Palace are divided into nine products, and the difference in wages is ten times.
Guards work less money, grade to burn seniority, three years nine products, ten years eight products, twenty years seven products, forty years six products, seventy years five products. Guards upgrade regardless of other only look at martial arts, break into the nine products building, break through the first floor upgrade one product.
More money, can often go out to do tasks, live a more colorful life, unlike the guard can only stay in the house to wait on people, but all have a little ability, as a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched his legs, the joints issued a series of crackles, and then swung his fists to practice, fists like shooting stars, breathing the wind.
"Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me!"
Chu left to spit out two words, a layer of bean sweat on his forehead.
The world is prosperous in martial arts, martial arts from the doll.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are set, even the magic of the mind works twice as hard, and it takes several times as long to build the foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he grew up in the Akiba Temple sorrel great wisdom of the original sutra, missed the foundation. The spirit is twice as strong as ordinary people, the spirit is strong.
Add to that the fact that he was a researcher in high-energy physics in a previous life, and his understanding of the world is far from comparable.
The combination of the two, he finally practiced the great wisdom of the original sutra, the achievement of the great circle mirror wisdom.
His spirit is strong, the duration of his cultivation is far better than ordinary people, he has supernatural powers in his body, he observes the subtle, so his small cleansing techniques progress quickly, and he can build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe... with your sword, the chicken can't be killed, so what are you doing? "
Chu suddenly put away his sword and hummed, "Bibi? "
He was panting and limp, and he leaned his sword on the ground to support himself.
1. Chapter 1
In the antique room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of a good special forces soldier!
As soon as the hand fell, the electric pain came, and there was a limp.
He opened his eyes.
There was a knock at the door.
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
This is a classical beauty, breathtakingly beautiful, can be used to describe her.
Ling Tian, Chinese.
He served in China's most outstanding wolf tooth special operations forces, during his service, made numerous achievements.
He participated in the world-class special forces competition, won the individual combat ability of the first personal honor, recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, during a cross-country SSS-class mission, a comrade-in-arms was killed due to a small personal mistake.
Under self-reproach, he chose to retire and leave the Wolves.
After his retirement, he was quiet for a while, chose to go abroad, and became the ace of one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it is his task, the success rate is unprecedented 100 percent!
Although he retired from wolf teeth for many years, he still has a heart for China.
As long as the task is unfavorable to China, he will not only not accept it, but will also pull out the person who issued the task and carry out inhumane torture and killing.
Over time, he became an eyesore and a thorn in the flesh of countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a ticking time bomb.
However, with the evaporation of one killer after another, the more alive and moist, no killer dares to take this 'death task'.
Killing the sky, is tantamount to self-death. This is the world's mercenary community, the killer community recognized a sentence.
Throughout the earth, rare opponents, not a single defeat!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted broker.
Country R has manufactured a colorless and tasteless chemical and biological weapon, which it intends to transport into China to carry out a terrible conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian will not sit idly by.
He shot it!
With the help of the broker, the location of the chemical and biological weapons was found.
Just as he made his way into the underground lab to destroy the chemical and biological weapons, the underground lab suddenly caved in, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When you see the R people holding all kinds of guns, appear outside the cage. Ling Tian will understand.
I was betrayed by the most trusted person!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the plot of the R people would not have succeeded.
Until he was shot and killed, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"Oh, my God, what's wrong with you? Don't scare your mother."
A soft voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he did not know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now, as if to see the next of kin, there is no hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
That's when Ling Tian was ready to reason with the beautiful woman.
Ling Tian was struck by lightning and completely froze, as if he had been pointed.
The only thing that makes Ling Tian satisfied is that this guy is also called Ling Tian, full name 'Duan Ling Tian'.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old.
Qingfeng Town Li family name outside the son.
His mother, Li Rou, is the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father... in his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of integrating this strange memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Ling Tian was seriously injured in bed.
Early this morning, Li Xin, the youngest son of the seven elders of the Li family, scolded Duan Lingtian for being a wild species born without a father.
However, he did not even complete the quenching body, and how can he be the quenching body of Li Xin's opponent, directly by Li Xin seriously injured, dying.
After the fusion of all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would be integrated into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, Duan Lingtian is him.
Madam, the master of the house has sent the medicine.
There was a knock at the door.
A maid hurried in from outside the room and handed the delicate box to Li Rou.
The box was opened, and suddenly the smell of the medicine wafted away.
"God, come, take the elixir, mother for your healing. "
Li Rou took a black elixir out of it and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the elixir.
The elixir melted in his mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A stream of cold air passed into his body, and the warmth of the elixir melted away, healing him.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that the soreness in his body disappeared for the most part, without any burden.
Is that the elixir he just took?
At this point, Duan Lingtian found that Li Rou's face was pale, his forehead was still sweating, and it was obvious that he had spent a lot of energy on healing.
Mother, are you all right?
Duan Lingtian's heart warmed.
This sound of 'mother', called affectionate, there is nothing unnatural.
"It's all right, it's all right to rest."
He shook his head.
For the sake of my son, it's nothing to consume this bit of energy.
"He and the seven elders are still waiting in the court," she said softly, half an hour later, as she entered the room again.
"Let it go? Talk to the man sent by the master of the house. I'll deal with it myself. "
The affability of Li Rou's face was gone, and he had a cold face.
"Mother, what kind of elixir did you just give me? I feel my injury is almost better. "
He sat on the edge of the bed.
"That's 'Eight Pins of Gold Chuangdan.'"
Originally, this eight-pin gold Chuangdan, even if the Qingfeng Town Li family, there are only two, and now actually used one in his foreign-named son.
Obviously, his mother's position in the Li family is not low.
"My God, the master of the house is still waiting. Let's go."
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and came to a spacious courtyard of the Li family mansion.
Here, it is the place where the Li family executes the family law.
It was midday and the sun was blazing.
There were people standing around the court, all the children of the Li family.
In the courtyard, a teenager was tied to Xingzhu and exposed to the sun, while two middle-aged men stood on the sidelines.
On the right side of the cockfighting eyes of the elderly, see Duan Lingtian mother and son two, a face of anger.
"Duan Lingtian also came... the family's treasured eight-pin Jinchuangdan medicine is really powerful!" "Yes, I also saw Duan Lingtian when he was carried back, half dead."
"Li Xin is the same, usually casually bully Duan Lingtian, even if the nine elders will not say anything, but this time he put such a heavy hand, almost killed Duan Lingtian, the nine elders do not get angry is strange."
One by one, the children of the Li family watched the arrival of Li Rouhe Duan Lingtian and whispered.
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
"Nine elders, today's matter, my son Li Xin was wrong first, but now that your son has nothing to do, my son has also been exposed to the sun all morning, can you put him down?"
At this moment, the cockfighting eyes of the elderly, that is, the seven elders of the Li family 'Li Kun', a haze.
I didn't know what to do with him.
Instead, he took Duan Lingtian and came to Li Xin, who was tied up.
"My God, how he hurt you in the morning, and now you give it all back to him! " Chapter 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, she found a very deadly problem. The surrounding environment had changed and she did not recognize it at all!
Looking out through the gap in the cloister, there was a moon bent in the sky, full of stars, and she was lying sideways being carried forward.
She was a little dazed, and she could not help moving, and then she discovered a more fatal problem--she was naked! She was covered only with a thin silk quilt, which bound her from head to toe, and only her eyes were exposed.
She looked down at the two men who were carrying her.
Kong Wu strong, muscle knots, ancient warrior dress, although carrying people to walk but quietly, a look is the practice of the family, martial arts is not low.
Gu Xijiu's fingers tightened in the quilt.
She is the king of modern killers, ruthless, crisscrossing the world, but did not expect to encounter the most trusted person's secret plan, that person's name is Longxi, is her former instructor, is also a doctor, she does not trust anyone, only trust him, even like him, want to marry him.
She was already dead, did not expect to go to Yan Wangye for tea, but inexplicably came here.
At this point, she didn't know what to do.
She crossed!
Crossed to the body, was wrapped like a dumpling and carried to a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah... ah... help... help... ah, ah, don't..." the woman's delicate and painful screams came out in an instant, calling back the thoughts of Gu Xijiu flying. Her eyes quickly swept, a little condensation! The furnishings in the hall are naturally beautiful, whether it is rosewood tables and chairs, or flowers and birds tortoiseshell screen, all show two words - noble!
The man above was handsome, twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with long hair pinned by a blue jade clasp, which fell haphazardly over his shoulders, smooth muscle texture, strong and powerful in a volte-faced movement, and his lips were pursed slightly, with a hint of a grim smile.
Below was a young girl, very young to look at the age, clear-eyed, and unlike the man's expression of enjoyment, the little girl's face was pale, her mouth was slightly open, her voice had been hoarse, whimpering, cold sweat had drenched her hair, and it was obvious that she was in extreme pain.
This bastard, strong x seedling ah! Who the hell is he?
The two men came in carrying Gu Xijiu, but they did not disturb the man's good spirits, and his movements were faster and more violent!
At last the little girl could not help herself, and gave a few hoarse cries, rolled her eyes, tilted her head, and did not move.
With a low curse, the man turned over, got down from the girl, and kicked the girl off the bed like a piece of garbage.
The girl did not move, her little face had turned sallow, and there was a line of blood running down the corner of her lip.
"This is too useless, take it to the mass grave and feed it to the dogs!" The man's voice was full of disgruntled indignation.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small city in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in northern Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, near Las Vegas to the west and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, these four names many Chinese have heard, but the four areas wrapped in the middle of the flagpole city, it is estimated that not many people know.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of the 'not many', until he came to Flagstaff to study abroad.
Flagstaff is not well known at home or in the United States, but it does have a few good universities, such as the University of Arizona and Flagstaff American College.
The school where Li Du studied abroad is called Flagstaff State College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College.
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American College, a very good private university, offering undergraduate, junior college, preparatory and other educational work.
This is a pheasant university, Li Du was completely fooled to come to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid for the first half of the year, the school was shut down, the school board and admissions department got the news ahead of time and ran away, leaving a group of international students faceless and forced by the police to leave the school.
Li Du is lucky, because the school accommodation is too chaotic, he did not have a dorm room in order to study quietly, but found an apartment to rent, and now he has a place to stay. His classmates who paid the accommodation fee to live in the school, this will be on the streets.
But his situation was not much better than that of his classmates. It was the end of January, and his rent was due. If he did not pay it in time, he might have to live on the street.
Tragically, he's out of money now!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and his classmates and friends in China, but that presupposes that he is studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he will not be able to finish his graduate studies. Where is the face to ask his elderly parents for money?
Sitting sadly at the door of the small building, the pine door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde girl poked her head out: "Hi, Li, are you here? "
The girl was his landlord, Hanna Fuchs, and the house belonged to her and her brother, Hans Fuchs, as a legacy of her parents, who had died in a car accident.
However, Hans, who claims to be 'busy with big business', does not come to stay for more than a few days a year, and the spare bedroom is rented out by Hanna to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du got up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's the matter? "
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear swirled on her pretty face: "I was cleaning the fridge when I saw a few cans of beer, which must have been left by that Hans fellow. I remember you like ale, why don't you drink it?"
In her hand was a half-dozen six-packs of beer in the usual wooden box with the unmistakable Budweiser logo.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There was only a small refrigerator in the apartment, and he would open and close it every day.
Besides, with Hans's temper, if there was beer, he wouldn't stay. The guy's a drinker.
According to his guess, the beer was bought by Hannah to comfort him, who had comforted him many times after learning that their school had been shut down.
But Hannah doesn't do much to reassure him, either by giving him a motivational book or a beer.
The American girl had asked him to learn about Chinese culture, and had learned the saying, "A drunken sleep relieves a thousand sorrows." She thought that, according to the Chinese character, a drunken sleep relieves sorrows, so she offered him beer several times.
Ridulph accepted Hannah's kindness and owed it to the girl. In American society, there were certain gifts that one could not refuse or be mistaken for friendship, and he cherished his friendship with Hannah.
He took the box, and Hannah smiled as she left, saying, "Life is full of problems, but it's still good. "
After repeating the American slang a few times, Li Du opened the package to take out a can of beer, but as soon as he opened the wooden box, a crystal like amber suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a 'click'.
The crystal, about the size of his thumb, fell hard on the concrete and cracked.
He guessed that it was amber because it was pale yellow in color and contained a small worm inside. It was similar to an amber he had seen in the sixth grade of primary school. At that time, their textbook had a text called "Amber" and the Chinese teacher brought an amber to their class.
The crystal reminded him of some of the best days of his childhood. He remembered that his teacher had said that amber with worms in it was precious. Unfortunately, the crystal had cracked, which made him regret that he could not sell it for two months' living expenses.
The crystal had fallen so badly that when he picked it up, it had shattered, revealing the purple worms it contained.
The insect resembles a locust in appearance, it is about two centimeters in length, strange appearance, with locust-like compound eyes, but only two legs under the stomach, legs with strange lines, no wings on the back, it looks clumsy.
Li Du had never seen such a bug, and strangely held it up to see it clearly.
Just then, something strange happened: the worm's claws suddenly moved, then quickly came to life and wriggled free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the worm jumped into his palm, head down, so slowly, bit by bit into his palm!
Li Du scared to pee, really want to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled toward the house and yelled, "Hannah, call 911! Help, there's a bug in my hand!"
Presuming that his screams were too harsh, Hannah came out with a panicked look on her face: "What? What bug? "
Li Du spread out his hand to show her: "That's it, this worm in the palm of my hand! "
Hannah's face was blank. "A worm in the palm of your hand? Where's a worm in the palm of your hand? "
Not only was there a bug, but the bug was still moving, and after it got into Li Du's palm, it didn't seem to want to be lonely, and then it got out again, and half of its body got out.
Li Du pointed to the worms that were drilling out and said in horror, "This, this, purple locusts, can't you see? "
Ridulph interrupted her and exclaimed, I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy, but I'm not, Hannah!
Chet, the worm is out again!
As he screamed at the top of his voice, the worm slowly crawled out of his skin and jumped to the ground, leaning up on his legs and walking on the ground with his legs like a man.
As it happened, it landed next to a drain, the bug did not pay attention to go over, fell headlong.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, "Great, the worm fell into the drain. "
Subconsciously, a thought occurred to him, what was in the drain? Could there be sewage and drown the worm?
But, let him unbelievable scene happened!
The first chapter
Shenzhou Land, Northern Desert.
Ice and snow ravaged the whole land, reckless mountains and ravines are a piece of silver, goose feathers snow rustling down, far away to see the sky and the earth in one color.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan was recuperating. The wind and snow were so heavy that it was difficult for the carriage to walk, and it had to wait for the wind and snow to be lighter before going on the road.
Look, the coffin-puller!
The exclamation of a middle-aged man aroused the attention of the caravan, a group of people curiously looked up into the distance, only a few glances, all physically and mentally shaken!
The wind and snow howled all over the sky, the sky and the earth became hazy, and a mysterious golden coffin loomed in the distance in the mountain road, gradually appearing in the public's view.
The golden casket was two meters long, one meter wide and high, and its walls were engraved with simple patterns and runes. The patterns and runes gave off a faint glow, shutting out all the falling snowflakes.
To the consternation of the crowd, there is also a point, the ancient coffin in front of the coffin puller.
It was a young man, who appeared to be only fourteen or fourteen years old. He was naked, his back hunched, his hands grasping two huge chains of cold iron, and carrying the chains on his shoulders, he was trying to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
Frozen and snowy, the teenager pulls the coffin!
The scene was visually striking and breathtaking. Behind the golden casket radiated a dim light, reflecting the young man's body a little blurred, unable to see his face, in a trance as if they had seen a god pulling the casket.
"This young man is born with supernatural powers.
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people came back to look at the young man carefully, to make sure that he did not have any mystical light shining on him, and moved again.
Ordinary willow coffins have three or four hundred pounds, this ancient coffin is cast in gold, needless to say at least three thousand pounds or more.
If a young man has no mystical power, he is not a true warrior. Even a strong man has only five or six hundred jin of great strength. A young man can pull an ancient coffin of three thousand jin by himself.
"Young, handsome, actually came to pull the coffin, this young man wants to be unlucky for the rest of his life? "
An old man lamented, and many people nodded their heads in agreement. Although it is not common to pull a coffin, it has happened occasionally in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knows something about it.
When an important member of the Northern Desert family dies, they like to be buried in a golden coffin. These coffins are not buried under the earth, but placed on top of an iceberg, which is said to protect the children of the family.
When the family declines or encounters great changes, the family will hold a coffin-pulling ceremony to find a new iceberg to transfer the family's ancestral coffin, replace the feng shui, recast the family's well-being.
This has the appearance of the coffin-puller.
In the minds of many people in the northern desert, when they pull a coffin, their own qi luck will be absorbed by the body in the coffin, the body essence and yangshou will also be absorbed, and they will be unlucky or ill for the rest of their lives.
So coffin-pulling is the most abject occupation in the northern desert, even if the commission is given no matter how high the young warriors will not be moved, only the down-and-out old warriors will go to the coffin-pulling.
The young man's facial features are typical, his height is about one meter seventy-five, his shoulders are broad and his waist is narrow, his legs are slender, and his muscles are knotted. He wears a simple animal tooth on his neck.
Fifteen years old, handsome, with a terrible power, the condition of a young man is not bad, but to do this most abject and depraved work of pulling coffins?
The middle-aged man stared at the golden casket for a few moments and said with relief, "This seems to be the ancestral casket of the Liu family. Yes, I heard that the Liu family has recently suffered a great change and has offered a sky-high price."
"Silence, the Lius are coming," said an old man suddenly, and all the caravan hurriedly shut up and looked away.
Woo hoo!
There was a howl of wild beasts in the distance, and a line of warriors in black armor, riding silver wolves, came running, not even close to the fierce breath of the wolves.
"Silver Wolf Guards, indeed, are the warriors of the Liu family. "
They all nodded darkly, the whole Wuling City around a thousand miles, only one army riding a silver wolf, that is the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the boy, and a middle-aged man in front of them, with a whip in his hand, looked at the boy and said, "Land away, hurry up! If you don't get to Black Hawk Ridge before dark, you won't get any reward."
The boy, known as Luli, looked up and was surrounded by a dozen huge silver wolves, one meter high and two meters long. He did not have much fear, nodded and said, "Your excellency can rest assured that I will arrive before dark."
With a deep drink, the giant man galloped away with the Silver Wolf Guard, quickly disappearing into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan that stopped nearby and continued to pull the coffin forward in silence. He grasped the cold iron chain with both hands and carried it on his shoulders, struggling with each step, his muscles trembling. Despite this, he did not stop, and soon crossed the caravan and headed off into the distance.
'it's so heavy! '
After a few miles, he went up a steep slope and stopped. He was panting with exhaustion, and he was sweating in such cold weather that you could imagine his physical exertion.
He thought about resting for a while, and after placing the coffin in place, he sat on a stone and took water and dried meat from a sack behind him, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
We should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat, he looked at the sky, his eyes quickly became bright, and said to himself: "Pull a coffin can be exchanged for an elixir, I do not know if the Liu family quenching body elixir is true as the legend, one can increase the power of 500 jin? "
"If I can really increase my strength by five hundred kilograms, I now have three thousand kilograms of strength, and I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand kilograms of strength, and I can... awaken the blood!"
"Look who in the tribe still dares to bully her sister? Hey, I'll be able to live a good life with my sister soon."
At the thought of it, Lu Li's tired face glowed with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time with more steady and fast steps.
Shake Shack!
After a few miles, a voice rang out behind him, and he looked back, his face slightly dark.
There was also a man in the back, but it was an old man. The old man was holding the chain in his hands with a white light, and there was a faint flow of white light on his feet.
Lu Li murmured enviously, the white light is the warrior's only mystical power. With mystical power, the warrior's strength will increase a lot, and the old man used mystical power, which is able to walk like a fly, easily pull the ancient coffin.
When the old man caught up with Luli, he looked at him, frowned and said, "Young man, why do you pull the coffin?
Lu Li smiled and did not say anything, the old man looked at him a few times, no more words quickly pull the coffin away.
"If you can no longer awaken the blood, then what is the future? Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, and my sister suffering along with it."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
At the thought of it, his face became a little contorted, and he let out an angry growl, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The blizzard is getting bigger and bigger, the sky is getting darker and darker, and the golden coffin in the vast mountain road is emitting a faint light, which looks very eerie and strange.
My Goddess Chapter 001
"My brother is going to look for a job, you do your homework at home, here is ten dollars, and don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon."
In front of a low hut in the slum, Lu Li patted little Lori's head and rubbed it lovingly. It was good to see her sister so healthy and alive!
"I know, brother, " grumbled little Lori. "Don't rub my hair, it's all messed up. "
Sister Lu Xin is very considerate to help Lu away sorting clothes, and like a small adult exhorted: "must work hard Oh, my brother so able to endure hardship, I believe this time will be able to find a job. "
"Don't worry, my brother will find a good job, make a lot of money, let Xinxin live a good life, " Lu Li hugged his sister, adding in his heart, will not be because of no money, and helplessly watch you lose your life a little bit.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will make a lot of money, " said little Lori, writhing in Luli's arms and waving her small fists.
No matter how reluctant, Lu left or said goodbye to his sister.
On the bus, he put his hand in his pocket and paused, unable to suppress a wry smile.
The money she had just given her sister for her lunch had returned to her pocket, and it was sad to think that the little girl would have done so.
Now is the 23rd century, the infinite development of science and technology, all kinds of intelligent technology filled every corner of the world, this development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but incidentally, also reduced the need for human resources to a minimum.
Unemployment is not an uncommon thing, especially for people at the bottom of the social ladder, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there is no accident, he will remain unemployed.
Until the chance to join a game guild gold group is considered stable, but because he entered the game called Dawn, the game has been open for nearly a year, too many levels behind, so has not been able to become one of the super-masters.
Two years later, her younger sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a medical examination at school.
Without the money to pay for millions of dollars in treatment, the game has been hunted down by several unions during that time, and can only painfully watch his only relative weaken day by day.
The taste was worse than cutting meat with a knife, and Lu Li held her sister more than once and cried out in pain.
However, there was a twist of fate. On the day she received the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and went to sleep in front of her sister's hospital bed. She woke up to find that she had been reborn three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, lots and lots of money.
With money, in order to cure her sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money, in order to let her sister, like her countless peers, live a happy life that innocent and lovely little girls should live.
With money, will raise eyebrows, at any time is not inferior!
Counting back and forth, land away very helpless to find, even if reborn, want to become rich is not easy.
The only thing he seems to be able to do is play the game -- Dawn, which he's been playing for more than two years -- and it's only a few days away from opening.
Lu Li has given up trying to find a serious job, he came out today and went directly to the headquarters of the Star and Moon Trade Union, where he had served in a previous life.
Star and moon union is not the game top ten, nor is it the top four, it is just a group of college students formed by the game union, the heads of the union are very rich rich second generation, because willing to spend money, so the development of the upside also looks like.
Located next to the university town, Qinghu District is the most scenic place of this generation, with mountains and rivers, cherry blossoms everywhere, office buildings in front, villas in the back, and only very wealthy people are likely to set up a company here.
The woman at the front desk took a look at Lu Li's dress with a little disgust, dialed a series of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that she could go in for an interview.
"We only recruit death squads at the moment, goldsmiths do not accept, " is responsible for the recruitment of a girl, dressed very trendy, while painting nail polish, while not looking up in charge of the interview.
The so-called death squad, in fact, is cannon fodder, a day to die a dozen will be a very normal thing.
Land away from the reason to find a studio to join, the purpose is to use the studio's game helmet for free, goldsmith although no future, but at least can upgrade, doomed to upgrade difficult cannon fodder is not what he wants, the game will die experience.
"What, 20 gold! " The girl exclaimed like a trampled cat as the nail polish was applied to her face.
Although "Dawn" represents today's most advanced virtual technology, with the world's most first-class design team, but it is not confident enough to dare to market without the inside, but the content of the test is relatively small, and is decentralized testing, and will not affect the normal game.
Just a few days of testing, the most impressive to players, that is, gold coins are not easy to play, and there are too many places to spend money.
Normal game players in the early basic income, experienced gold players can not save a few silver coins a day.
There are senior professional players estimated that want to save enough to establish a union of 20 gold, a 100-player gold group to brush the right monster, remove repair equipment and potion consumption, at least a week or even more time, this is the game before the third system update of the high rate of money explosion.
And in front of this boy, he actually promised to be able to come up with 20 gold within a week!
Twenty gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you participated in the medial side, did you find any money-swiping bugs? " The recruitment beauty moved in her heart and asked suspiciously.
Luli smiled and said nothing, looking extremely inscrutable.
"Ao Jian, I have something here, you come over. . . Well, someone came to apply for gold, said a week can hand over twenty gold, I suspect he has a BUG to brush money, " recruitment beauty has no way, can only whisper to call the senior.
There was a knock at the door, and a knock at the door.
In addition to Ao Jian, the boss of Xingyue, the people who came here were actually followed by several people. Lu had been in the Xingyue union for two years, and most of these people knew each other, all of whom were high-level members of the union.
"Oh, don't tell me, this is the guy who can get twenty gold a week, " the little man walking next to Ao Jian couldn't help but wail, this man's game name is half a cigarette, is the head of the Star and Moon Union Thieves, is a very irritable person.
"Do you have a way to get twenty gold coins in a week, and make sure it's the Dawn game?" Ao Jian's face was not very good-looking, and he was holding out a glimmer of hope, but when he saw Luli's appearance, that glimmer of hope was gone.
He was an ordinary-looking man, his face sallow and dark, his clothes crumpled, and there were obvious signs of wear and tear at the corners, and he knew at a glance that he was the kind of man who rolls around at the bottom of society.
"Words are unwarranted, even if you can't get you don't have much to lose, right?"In the face of the huge aura, the social elites in front of and behind the crowd, Lu Li did not have the cramp of the small people at the bottom, just a faint smile, calm eyes seem to be full of endless confidence.
The first chapter
"Yemer, Yemer, you're all right, get up quickly, there's going to be a class soon, this class is merciless ice, you hurry up." A somewhat urgent voice rang in Yemer's ear, and Yemer had a very strange feeling.
"This idiot, who is supposed to be faceless, covers his face. " Another voice rang in his ear, but Yemer awoke.
Yemo looked around blankly, no one knew, all strange faces.
It was obvious that the laughter was directed at him, and the people who were laughing around him seemed to be laughing at him, and for a moment he did not dare to ask aloud, but could only guard himself to prevent someone from laying hands on him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who did not laugh at himself, just now he was kind enough to push himself to wake up.
"How is it like a school?" Yemer asked subconsciously with some surprise.
"Haha..." came another burst of laughter.
"Ye Mo, I think you're confused, Yan Yan is also free to write love letters? You're all right in the Ye family, now you're not a member of the Ye family, be careful in the future."
The tablemate sighed, and of course did not believe that Yemo would not remember for a while, but only to save face. He had not yet recognized the reality, and he was no longer Yemo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head bursts of pain, and he remembers that he and Master Luo Ying were refining back to Yuandan, and then the group of stray hairs of Xiliumen hit, and then the sound of explosions and all kinds of fighting, and remembers that Master held himself in the back with a recluse, but how did he appear here? Is this still the Luo Yue mainland?
By the way, he's sitting here now, and what about Master? Master is only three years older than him, and what's more, the reason why Xiliumen suddenly attacked them was because Master was so beautiful, and Xiliumen's young master wanted to marry his beautiful Master, and was rejected by Master.
In the event that Master fell into the hands of Xiliumen, the consequences would be unimaginable, and at the thought of it, Yemer could no longer contain his inner panic and suddenly stood up.
A cold-faced young woman came up to the platform with a few books under her arm, and with a cold glance at the laughing students below, the laughter subsided.
We all know that this is the English class lecturer Yun Bing, the most annoying is the students coaxing, and once she stares, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo has felt that something is wrong, although he understands the words, but the obvious language is not their original use, is this not the Luo Yue mainland? Frowning, Ye Mo wants to know more clearly, bursts of headache came, a lot of garbled information was memorized.
After the death of his father, Yemo was completely expelled from the Ye family, specifically because Yemo was not the seed of Ye Qiantian. To be more precise, after the death of Yemo's father, Yemo's bloodline was re-identified again, and it was determined that he was not the seed of the Ye family.
However, he also has a younger sister Ye Ling, a younger brother Ye Feng, and he is not a mother, but a half-brother and sister. Three years ago, his father seems to know that he owes Ye Mo, and specifically proposed to the Ye family to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianqian probably knew that he was not well, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, which found the Ning family in Beijing.
Of course, the Ning family was willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China, and promised the granddaughter of the Ning master, Ning Light Xue, to Ye Mo.
In a hospital medical examination, Ye Mo was found to be impotent, to put it bluntly, is not humane. Although the Ye family tried to hide the fact, but overnight it seems that the whole capital people know, one of the five families of China, the Ye family out of impotence, the Ye family is also a big disgrace.
"Ah. . . " Yemer exclaimed as the memory was turned over. He stood up and almost immediately took his pants off to look at them. He had some idea that he might be reborn into a man named Yemer, but he was so inhuman that it might as well kill him.
"That classmate, what's your name, what do you shout in class, go to my office after class."The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's exclamation, and her face was very unattractive.
The rest of the class are secretly amused, let a college student go to the office at the drop of a hat, it is estimated that only this English teacher can do it out, not to do it, the credits in the hands of others.
Ye Mo sat down dejectedly, although he did not understand the inside story of the family struggle, but also some understanding that he was probably driven out of the Ye family because of impotence, not necessarily because he was not a member of the Ye family, and DNA testing to do a little bit of fiddling who knows.
Ye Mo wasn't worried about being kicked out of the Ye family, he didn't care about that at all, he was concerned about his impotence, and what was going on with his master Luo Ying.
But he also understood why the class was laughing, because his predecessor had clearly been kicked out of the Ye family, but also to die to pursue the hottest girl in the class Yanyan. As a result, he posted his confession love letter on the blackboard, and then stood on the platform contemptuously looked at himself and said: "Master Ye, can you have sex with me?
Later, after the impotence thing was reported, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to save face, but he did not expect that the girl who had been very flattering to him actually did so to him, and then fainted under the shame, cheapening his own rebirth.
He couldn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's lesson on the platform, and even if he did, Yemo wouldn't listen to it. He couldn't accept the fact that he was now impotent. It was better not to be reborn than to be reborn like this.
It doesn't matter if he can't go to college, the main thing is to figure out his current situation. His impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family, although he was thrown out of the Ye family, but who knows if he will suddenly be killed? Maybe there are other insiders who caused him to be thrown out of the Ye family, and now his safety is still guaranteed?
After the bell rang, of course, the first thing Yemer did was not go to the beautiful teacher, but rushed out of the school, he wanted to find a place to see his own little * *, is not really impotent.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are a lot of small alleys, Ye Mo hurried into a lonely alley, hurriedly pulled down his pants.
Xiao ** was indeed very small, but Ye Mo was not disappointed because Xiao ** was small, but really hissed. He was not impotent, but because Xiao ** was too big, blocked by a meridian development, resulting in this false impotence situation.
But that's the way it is. With the technology on Earth now, it's no doubt a dream to open up this blocked meridian of his own, but it's hard to defeat Ye Mo. Although he still doesn't have the ability to open up the blocked meridian and make his little a * * strong, as long as he reaches the third level of qi practice, this meridian will automatically be opened up.
But Yemo immediately began to feel a little disappointed again, because in the rarefied condition of the Earth, it was undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of qi practice, and perhaps he would not be able to achieve it in his lifetime. In that case, he would still be the equivalent of impotence. Sighing, Yemo was about to pull up his pants when a sudden exclamation made him arouse his spirit.
"Hooligan ah..." an absolutely high-decibel soprano, rang out in front of Yemo, Yemo just to check his own small * *, actually forgot to check the situation around. I did not expect that this small alley is still connected, but in front of the turn here can not see it.
Yemer was not an exhibitionist, and he had no capital to expose now, so he quickly pulled up his pants and was about to slip away.
"Yemer, how is it you?" the woman asked in a startled tone after she had screamed, and it was clear that she knew Yemer.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Late at night, Qingzhu Senior Community, Jinhai City.
Shifeng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents, looking out of the floor-to-ceiling window at the swimming pool, full of loss and unwillingness.
As the leader of Shadow, one of the four major game studios in Gimhae City, he leads a guild of tens of thousands of people, and is a well-known sword magician in Gimhae City, but now he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
Ten years in the game.
Ten years of bloodshed.
After countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild and established ten city-states in the Realm of God, where he could begin to compete with the first-class guilds and enjoy endless glory.
Shifeng never thought that his ten years of hard work will be in vain, for the game, he gave up so much, but in the end it became someone else's wedding dress, all because he opposed the shadow into the super guild hegemony, less than the next day Lanhua Foundation gave him an answer, delete his ten years of hard work into the 200-level sword king account, go to the treasury to settle wages.
All he could get was five million credits and a mansion, which was less than a drop in the bucket compared to the ten city-states he had built, the virtual kingdoms of the Sun.
Shifeng thought that he paid so much for the shadow, so that Lanhua Group into a large consortium, a lot of credit is his, but the result is like throwing garbage in general, he lost, for what Lanhua Consortium did, he will be revenge.
"I'm never going to leave it at that. It's a big deal to start all over again."
Shifeng's eyes flashed with confidence and firmness, the release document in his hand was torn to shreds, and then picked up a bottle of red wine on the table, suddenly poured a few mouthfuls.
Even without the Sword King account, without the support of the team, but the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, the same can rise in the realm of God, and once again establish a virtual kingdom of their own.
Early in the morning, the sun is just rising.
Drop by drop!
The phone kept ringing.
Shifeng was dissatisfied with being woken up, helpless to get up and pick up the phone next to the bed, last night's hangover is still dizzy.
Hello, what's the matter?
"Feng Ge, I'm Kuroko, what else do you ask? We said we want to become professional players, today is the day of recruitment in the school shadow studio, you have not always wanted to become a core member of the shadow?"
Shifeng was a little confused.
Just fired by the Lanhua consortium, and how can I go to the shadow examination. "Feng brother, Feng brother?
Are you listening? They're going to test it at ten o'clock, and if you don't hurry up, it'll be too late!
"Heiko, you don't have to be kidding, I've just been fired by Shadow. "
"Feng brother, how much did you drink yesterday? You haven't woken up until now, and the shadow hasn't hired anyone, so how do you get fired?
Before Shifeng could react, Heiko hung up the phone.
Dizzy Shifeng, looked at the phone, found that this old love crazy six, is not his phone at all, his phone is the latest love crazy twelve.
Then look around. Less than fifteen square meters of the small bedroom is a mess, full of books on the game strategy, and the corner desk on the laptop, is also very backward old model, the wall of the wardrobe, scattered with a lot of clothes, and in the wardrobe fitting mirror appeared a familiar face.
Shifeng saw this familiar face, suddenly startled.
Shifeng immediately got up and went to the fitting mirror, photographed and photographed, to make sure that he really became young.
Yesterday I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom, and now I get up and go to this broken place, and I'm getting younger.
Shifeng still has some memories of this place. It was ten years ago, in order to fight for the small house he rented when he was a senior in Shenyuan, he lived for more than half a year, and then he made some money in Shenyuan, and went to the city to rent a large apartment-style house.
Thought that year was extremely difficult, the situation at home was not good, in order for him to go to college, he also owed a lot of foreign debt, so his parents also hard-earned money every month to send enough living expenses, let themselves suffer.
Shifeng single-mindedly wanted to make money to change the family situation, but college students are all over the streets, want to find a good income job is more difficult than the sky, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game, in order to improve the game technology, he ruthlessly bought a virtual helmet, has become a professional gamer as the goal, in the virtual game hard training technology.
At that time, he ate white buns and noodles every day, in order to save money, he did not participate in every class reunion or fraternity, so he became a little transparent in the class, the boys despised, the girls saw far away, every time he went to the supermarket to buy noodles, but less than ten credits in his wallet, even a credit of ham sausage did not dare to buy, the saleswoman looked at Shifeng pitiful, recommended special ham, Shifeng looked at the tempting ham, and touched his wallet, or gritted his teeth and refused.
'who's kidding me? '
Shifeng looked at the familiar scene and his younger self in the mirror, shook his head and denied the idea.
Even the most developed America does not have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shifeng looked at the time on his phone again.
19 April 2129.
"Is it that I was born again?" Shifeng joked with a wry smile on his face.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, and that it could not be April 2129, when he was still a senior.
Shifeng shook his head, trying to sober up, but still holding a glimmer of hope that he could be reborn, really back to ten years ago, so he went to the computer desk, opened the laptop.
If the time of the mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the network can not be faked.
After a few minutes on the net.
Shifeng was completely shocked, he inquired on the network of various information, all show that today is indeed April 19, 2129, even the official opening time of the global fiery divine domain, the official website is clearly written, the countdown is six days later on April 25.
"Did I really go back to ten years ago?" Shifeng stared at the news report of Shenyuan, leaving tears of emotion in the corners of his eyes.
At this time Shifeng's mood is indescribable, there is regret, there is grief, there is joy.
It was as if everything in front of him was a dream.
But the sound of cicadas outside the window, and the air conditioning blowing cold air, reminded Shifeng that it was all true.
Looking at the family photo in college on his mobile phone, Shifeng never found that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles in the corners of her eyes. They were really old and not as vibrant as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the divine realm, high debt, excessive labor and pressure, so that his parents were seriously ill, a disease can not afford, want to be cured to recover millions of credit points, but at that time Shifeng was only a shadow of a small captain, the money earned simply could not pay such an expensive cost.
In order to raise money, Shifeng tried his best, but it was not enough. Even if Shifeng tried his best to maintain, his parents left after a few months.
He did not take good care of his parents in his last life, and who knows the pain and regret?
Even if later Shifeng earned millions of credit points, this has become a permanent pain in Shifeng's heart.
I didn't expect fate to play such a joke on him, actually starting from scratch, everything back to the origin.
"Well, that's great, hahaha. Now that I've been born again, I'm going to change all that, earn enough money, cure my parents, and stop them from working for a living." Shifeng wiped tears from his eyes and swore to himself.
Just as Shifeng was planning his future, Heiko called again, constantly urging Shifeng to go to the university for examination.
However, Shifeng was not in a hurry, dressed and packed himself before heading to Jinhai University.
He was all too familiar with shadows.
I remember when I was in college, Lan Hailong, the grand dude of Lanhua Group, opened a shadow studio, and at the same time provided a lot of money to organize the master students in Jinhai University, to fight in the realm of God, when he also went to the examination, and became a core member, Heiko became a peripheral member, when he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, Shadow Studio has his leadership, let the Lanhua Group in the divine realm to make a lot of money, a leap into a large consortium, did not expect to be fired by the Blue Sea Dragon himself.
Now that he has been reborn, he also has an advantage over the divine realm that others cannot match. Naturally, he is not ready to join the shadows again, to become a tool for others, to make money for others. He wants to take a different path, to fight for his own life, not to have his parents send living expenses, to pay off all his debts, so he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shifeng came to the No. 1 teaching building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking up and down at the gate, anxious.
"Feng brother, you finally came, fortunately the registration is not closed, let's hurry in to register it," said Heiko anxiously after seeing Shifeng.
Shifeng shook his head and said very seriously, "Heiko, I'm not going to go to the shadow, I want to open my own studio, will you come? "
Kuroko met in a virtual game, the technology is very good, and then together to break into the world, can be said to be brothers, working together in the shadow of the day, although Kuroko has no game talent, but the management is very strong, the guild hundreds of thousands of people in order to manage, if Kuroko's help, to achieve the goal will be further, but he will comply with Kuroko's choice, after all, he now has nothing, Kuroko's family situation is not good, in order to live only decided to do professional players, join the shadow to earn a living.
After a full minute, Kuroko looked up at the stone peak.
"Feng brother, you don't say stupid things, do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's eight thousand credits, to open a studio, at least six people, but also work space, but also pay wages and so on, the start-up capital alone will be seventy-eight thousand, and follow-up investment, that's a lot of money, but now you have so much money?" Heiko knew Shifeng's situation very well, knew that Shifeng's family is not good, and wanted to persuade Shifeng to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy Shenyu virtual helmet now." Shifeng silently nodded and admitted that, as Kuroko said, even 7 or 8 million said less, remember the 100-person studio recruited by Blue Feilong, spent more than 5 million, and later in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio, and spent a lot.
"In that case, why should we take the risk, go to the shadow is not more stable, at least the shadow can provide virtual helmets, otherwise we can not even play, let alone become professional players." Kuroko saw that Shifeng understood the crux of the problem, immediately relieved, and pulled Shifeng to enter the teaching building.
Shifeng shook off Kuroko's hand, looked at Kuroko seriously, and said, "But I still plan to open my own studio, I don't want to be controlled, Kuroko you come? "
Shifeng will not force Kuroko, after all, he has no guarantee, and it is impossible to tell the secret that he is a reborn person, only hope that Kuroko will believe him.
Heiko saw Shifeng such a serious look, always feel that today's Shifeng is very strange, too crazy, virtual game upfront can not make money, this we all know, is there any way for Shifeng to make money in the divine realm? Even if the money is a few months later, they do not have so much time to waste.
Kuroko hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed: "I know, who let you be the big brother, I open a studio with you is, but what about the virtual helmet, without the helmet we can not play the game? "
Shifeng's tight brow suddenly relaxed, happy to pat Heiko on the shoulder, smiled: "This is my good brother, the virtual helmet thing is at ease, I remember there is a trial offer for college students in Shenyu, every university has a place to issue, as long as you rely on your student ID card, you can get a virtual helmet free trial for ten days, let's take a look at it."
Heiko's swarthy face turned blue at this time, feeling that the future is a dark, why would he believe in Shifeng? Is it the kind of self-confidence and stability of Shifeng? Is it really no problem to start a business with Shifeng?
What can you do in ten days in Godland?
Ten days past, will certainly miss the major studios to hire a good time, in the end is not to buy a virtual helmet, but how to get the money?
If you want to earn 16,000 credits in the opening ten days, even a group of professional players can't do it!
"Leave the question of money to me."
Shifeng patted Kuroko on the shoulder and smiled confidently.
Earning 16,000 credits in ten days is fanciful, but he has the courage of a born-again, no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break one by one. And the opening of the divine realm is the beginning of his rise.
Then Shifeng with Heiko to get the trial helmet, and all the money to buy instant noodles, put in the rental room next to the computer table, a full two boxes, enough food for more than ten days, and then explained some of the things of the divine realm, quietly waiting for the opening of the divine realm.
At nine o'clock in the evening of April 25, there were a few glimmers of light in the dark and silent hut.
Shifeng lay still on the bed, his eyes closed, and gently clicked the start button of the helmet.
"Godland, here I come."
I can't tell what this sound is, hearing the ear seems to penetrate the body into the soul, let the body can't help but hit a few shivers in this cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpered through the heavens and the earth, and gusts of snow fluttered with the wind, fragmenting the heavens and sprinkling the earth layer by layer.
It was not night, it was only dusk, but the sky was as dark as night, and it gave a heavy feeling, as if it weighed on the heart and breathless. On the silvery earth, a great outline could be seen, a magnificent city, like the presence of a great beast.
In the center of the city, there was a towering tower-like altar, in the shape of seven horns, all dark, straight into the clouds, standing tall and motionless in the blizzard, and the whimpering wind that blew on the altar was mixed with the sound of such a karaoke, scattered into the distance, with primitive roughness, with a different charm.
A hoarse murmur floated from the altar in the blizzard, and seemed to merge with the wind, faintly indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where is it, and if there is no hope, why let me see it! " The voice was frantic, almost hysterical, and roared for nine days.
Beneath the altar, at this moment, there are countless figures dressed in moustaches, silently standing there, from a distance, there are hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, around the altar, densely packed, motionless, but there is a fanaticism emerging, as if the people on the altar a word, they can give everything for it.
The snow, it's bigger.
"If you let me see it, there must be hope, but where is the hope? " The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, full of sorrow, and lingered.
"Today bright yellow wrong return, three Tai open the wasteland, the snow wind, forever, the old man to count the barbarian! " The voice suddenly became louder, do not know what means, but saw that the sky on the wind and clouds change, countless falling snowflakes all suddenly stopped, then all rolled back, from all sides roaring to come together, making the heavens tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky, and all the snowflakes coalesced to form a huge snow-colored dragon. As soon as the dragon was formed, it immediately raised its head to the sky and hissed, its voice piercing into the ears, so that all who heard it were immediately shaken, as if they were about to be torn apart by the sound.
Shocking bursts of blood, excreted from the body of the snow dragon, soon permeated its whole body, so that the snow dragon as a blood dragon, it is a sad roar, struggling body fiercely towards the sky, like a meteor straight into the sky, as if to blow a hole in the day, open a hope.
Its speed, the blink of an eye is endless, roaring and whirling, as if the dragon hit an invisible diaphragm somewhere, the heavens and the earth shook, the humming sound spread in all directions, the blood dragon screamed again, the body with visible speed layer by layer collapse.
Just as it was about to break apart completely, the hundreds of thousands of silent people below the altar, all hands pinched, bit the tip of their tongues, spewed out a mouthful of blood, which seemed to be pulled by some force, galloped up, like a sea of blood rising into the air, straight to the collapsing blood dragon, and merged with it, so that the dragon's collapse eased and rushed higher into the sky.
Seeing the blood dragon flying higher and higher, gathered the eyes of all, but at this moment, the blood dragon is a violent body shock, issued a hiss spread over tens of thousands of miles, can no longer prevent the collapse of the body, turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes, fluttering down, from a distance to see the world has been dyed into a red yellow spring.
Even more at this moment, the moment of the collapse of the blood dragon, from its mouth came a voice completely different from the mournful roar! "Sorrow. . . "
At the top of the altar, in the very center, sat cross-kneed an old man in a purple robe, his face wrinkled and speckled with brown, his eyes open in a murmur, but they were dim, and he was obviously blind.
In front of him lay a complete spine, radiating a white mantle, and in his right hand he held a stone tablet resting on the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes looked silently at the sky, for a long, long time, with a long sigh.
As he spoke, his right hand, which held the stone tablet, moved again on the strange spine, rubbing against the bone, making a clicking sound, and dissipating into the distance, his figure shivering and blending with the sound, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
Late at night, it was dark, but the reckless mountains were not calm, the beasts were haunted, the roars shook the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, and the leaves rustled and fell.
There was another roar, and Lin Feng shrank his neck, brushed off the leaves that had fallen on his body, and looked at the mountains in the dark, sighing in his heart that it was completely different from the earth.
Lin Feng sat under the tree in a daze, opposite a few tough youngsters are looking at him with disdain, a small fat man is shouting at Lin Feng: "Leave you a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat dry food, hurry to work! "
Lin Feng came to his senses, did not speak, patted his buttocks and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted: "Useless waste, not as strong as a child, he should be thrown into the mountains to be eaten by the beasts! "
Lin Feng skimmed his lips, brother a person who came across the earth, how to compare physical strength with your herd of animals?
This great world of Tianyuan is a world dominated by true cultivators.
The wolf village in front of us is just a small village in the reckless mountains. Of course, there are no true cultivators, but every villager practices martial arts and exerts his strength, even women and children.
Only in this way can we survive in a world where ferocious beasts are rampant and even ancient relics are infested.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village also have to go into the mountains to hunt, many prey are used to come out at night, although the night into the mountains is dangerous, but the harvest will be greater.
People in the village have become accustomed to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village do not sleep, they gather together to play, waiting for their own adults to return from hunting.
Also dragged clear nose children, do not care to play with dozens of hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, a group of teenagers are competing to see who can lift the village weighs up to a thousand pounds of giant ding.
Lin Feng looked at the group of small animals, sighed, and compared with their strength, he really looked like a waste of wood.
But this will not let Lin Feng feel depressed, although from time to time people talk behind him, but he still rely on the ability to fool around in this small mountain village called Wolf Village to stay temporarily. What really makes his eggs hurt is that there is one more thing in his mind.
Super Grandmaster System.
At first Lin Feng was still happy, thinking that crossing is to have welfare, but the system explained that the first half of his heart cooled.
"The main task of the system: host Kaishan faction, establish this side of the world's largest clan, become the first ancestor. "
"The main quest is divided into different stages, each stage needs to be completed within a limited time, timeout is not completed, directly obliterate the host!"
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence "Efface the host", speechless for a long time, and finally squeezed a few words out of his teeth: "I bought a watch last year! "
After the anger, Lin Feng helplessly read the content of the mission, he is not ready to risk challenging the system, to see if the other side can erase him, just came to the world ass is not sitting hot, he does not want to die again.
The main task 1.0 - to receive four pro-transmission of the mantle disciples.
Mission Statement: Even if you are a scattered cultivator and want to pass on your mantle, you should also take students. The most important resource of a school is always people, and it is the gifted disciples who pass on their talents.
Mission time limit: One year, timeout not completed, direct obliteration of the host.
"Pit father ah!" Lin Feng sighed, we just crossed the new people, young like a refreshing cabbage, I should hurry to find a big cow as a master, a good hug thigh right?
System big brother you somehow give me this cheats, in order to receive apprentices, this poor and white, what do you want me to teach others?
What is more pit, the system said that there is a newbie package, but told their own package system failure, the newbie package delayed release, so that Lin Feng lamented that there is no most pit father only more pit father.
Open the exchange system, but a variety of good things dazzling, magic elixirs, magic exercises, only you can't think of, no he is out of stock.
The problem is, everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng does not have even one exchange point at the moment, can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding his mother in his heart, and there was a sudden commotion at the entrance of the village. It looked like the hunting party had returned.
The youngsters waiting in the village cheered and went to the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced at them indifferently, but was dismayed to find that all the young men who had returned from hunting had returned empty-handed, with no prey to speak of, and even their weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are a second life, living in the mountains, without weapons simply can not live.
An imperceptible smile crossed Lin Feng's lips: "There seems to be a story."Thinking of this, he also walked towards the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before he got close, he heard someone yelling, "Wolf Wind is the hope of our Wolf Village, and now he has been seriously wounded by the people of Shicun.
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young man in the middle of the crowd slumped to the ground, covered with bruises, with a cold glow of hatred in his eyes.
"Is this the genius that the people of Wolf Village are talking about?" Lin Feng peeked in to observe, for this wolf wind, he is also well-known for a long time, the idol of the whole Wolf Village youth, regarded as the hope of the village, today Lin Feng is the first time to see a real person.
Although the wolf wind at this time was injured in the body, his expression was weak, but he was full of qi and blood, and although his physical strength could not be compared with that of a true cultivator, he was definitely at the top of the worldly warriors.
According to the axioms of the Great World of Heaven and Yuan, people have this level at a young age, and if they cultivate Zhen and practice qi, they will also have a future. In the final analysis, Zhen cultivators guide the Reiki of heaven and earth into their bodies, condense their mana, and strengthen their own foundations.
Lin Feng silently tones out his own super-grandfather system, which has a disciple talent detector, and he presses OK on the wolf wind.
"The subject's qualifications are too low to become a disciple of the host. "
Lin Feng frowned. The system was too fussy, and he had thought of taking in four disciples at random first, fooling around with the one-year deadline of the system, and finally expelling the handful of disciples from the door and wall.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to exploit the loopholes in the system, and even a talented young man like Wolf Feng, who is known for his ten miles and eight townships, is not qualified. Lin Feng wants to gather four disciples to complete the system task, and it is too difficult.
"A year, a year..." Lin Feng sighed gloomily.
In the crowd, an old man next to Wolf Wind turned blue and grunted, "Wolf Wind is my grandson, of course, this matter can't just be settled, but not now. There has been a lot of movement in the mountains in recent days, and it looks like a mountain treasure is going to be born. Get the mountain treasure first, and then settle accounts with Ishimura!"
There are often armed fights between rural clans, Lin Feng is not interested in this, but the word "Shanbao" into his ear, let his heart move slightly.
Lin Feng was thinking about Shanbao, when he heard someone in the crowd swearing in a low voice: "I don't know how Shicun raised such a small monster, not yet four years old, a small doll, can even defeat the genius of our village wolf wind, it's hell! "
His eyes lit up.
The little doll, less than four years old, defeated the wolf wind in front of him?
Wolf Wind already had some talent, and the man who wounded him was not even four years old. What kind of talent was that?
The little fat man next to Lin Feng swore in a low voice, "Damn the little devil, he must be killed! "
Looking at him, Lin Feng echoed, "Yeah, yeah."
But in his mind, this little doll may be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd, he now wished to immediately grow wings to fly to the stone village, but he did not dare to go out of the village alone, otherwise it would be directly to the mountain beasts to feed.
At this point, the mechanical rigidity of the cue suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"Starter package released, do you check it immediately? "
Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, his heart was overjoyed, he had never felt that the dull system beep was so melodious.
Find a place where there's no one. Lin Feng opens the package.
Starter Package: The host gets the basic training for the four levels of the Qi training period, gets a chance to win a raffle, gets 300 redemption points, gets the Taoist secret "Nine Days of Thunder Rectification" and gets the magic nine days of thunder.
Lin Feng froze, and a warm current fell from the top of his head, straight between his chest and abdomen, quickly rushed to open a hidden hole in the body.
There are twelve important acupuncture points hidden in the human body, which cultivators call the Twelve Towers.
During the Qi training period, the cultivation is divided into twelve levels in order to open the twelve-fold building. As each acupuncture point is opened, the Reiki will be transformed into mana, and the cultivator's mana will go up a step.
Lin Feng now felt a warm current of continuous fighting, along the way, until the opening of the four acupuncture points in his body did not disappear. With Lin Feng's breath, the energy of the outside world was quickly inhaled into the body, circling in the four acupuncture points that were opened.
Each acupuncture point is like a non-stop operation of the star cluster universe, Reiki is constantly transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just as the universe began to open, the evolution of all living things in general.
Lin Feng felt that his whole body had become light, his mind moved, and the magic in the acupuncture trick was like a spring, and the explosive power was stupid.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and was relieved: "Finally a little bit of self-preservation." But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system is to establish the first clan in history, and that he wants to become the first grandmaster in history, Lin Feng was suddenly under a lot of pressure, and hurriedly checked the other things in the starter package.
"Raffle opportunity?" Lin Feng looked at the auxiliary training system in addition to the exchange system, there is a lottery system, but it is gray, not yet activated, do not think about it for the time being.
For now, we can only hope that the purchasing power of those 300 exchange points is higher.
While thinking, Lin Feng into the exchange system, before a poor, he did not have the heart to look at the price.
Looking carefully at the price tag, Lin Feng scolded the system black heart, the lowest level of a bottle of Qi Dan, to ten exchange points, a slightly spiritual iron sword to thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic outfit, a set of feathers and a star crown, it's fifty points.
The most basic supernatural powers such as "fireball" and "palm thunder" such as stalls, to 100 points.
As for those behind the buttocks hung a string of zero high-grade goods, Lin Feng did not dare to look, afraid of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "existing exchange points" column and shook his head: "Too little start-up capital. "
Fortunately, the novice package came out with a book of Taoist secrets and a magic, otherwise Lin Feng really want to catch blind.
Taoism is the foundation of cultivation, mainly to improve the realm, while supernatural powers are practical martial arts or spells that have many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the package is of high grade, the existing exchange system can not even be redeemed, the system must be upgraded before it can be redeemed.
As for the system upgrade, but need Lin Feng to complete a certain number of system tasks before opening, it is too early to say.
Jiuxiao Tianlei Fa-rectification is one of the top Lei Dao methods in this Tianyuan world, but it has been lost for many years, and the predecessors who were successful in cultivation in the past were all bulls walking sideways with this Dao method.
According to the instructions, the novice package is a random method, can open a nine-day thunder rectification, Lin Feng is the ancestral tomb smoke, 300 exchange points although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng at this time in the heart of the depression swept away.
Such a top-level Taoist book, if there is no damn main task, Lin Feng must first find a no-man's land to practice a body of magic before coming out to kill the four sides.
But now that it's going to take an apprentice, it's a different story.
Dissatisfaction to dissatisfaction, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his state of mind, and acted quickly.
He remained silent, asked the way to the stone village, and quietly left the wolf village without disturbing others.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility, and Lin Feng, who has become a cultivator, is not afraid of the people of Wolf Village, but he is afraid that they will reveal their identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, now the wolf village people gathered at the entrance of the village, because the wolf wind was injured a lot of things to talk about, Lin Feng from the village around the back, no one noticed his movements.
On the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate to invest directly in 50 exchange points to buy a outfit for himself.
How could Lin Feng from the earth not know the truth of "Buddha wants gold, people want clothes", want to sell things, publicity and packaging should be done first.
Looking down at their feathered star crown, white robes with wide sleeves, a school of fairy wind and bone to get the image of a high person, Lin Feng nodded with satisfaction, the system is expensive things are expensive, but the quality of the sale is really not said.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing that caught his eye was half of a huge dead tree, the trunk diameter of a full ten meters, the whole body blackened.
Lin Feng looked at it and speculated that it was a lightning-struck tree, which had been split by lightning many years ago. The huge crown and vigorous vitality of the old tree had been destroyed, and now there was only a stump eight or nine meters high on the ground.
But just by looking at the size of the existing trunk, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead tree was blackened and showed no signs of life.
At that moment, an old man came up to him, coughing and saying, "This tree has been withering for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng and looked him up and down with a pair of eyes, "Little old man is the head of this stone village.
Lin Feng smiled, the body naturally exuded a breath of dust and pride, and then with a outfit, white robes with wide sleeves, feathers and star crowns, selling appearance completely unfussy, absolutely the world's superior model.
"Discover the goal, suitable to become the host's pro-disciple."
Lin Feng just wanted to talk, heard the sudden sound of the system beep, almost choked on the drool.
The old mayor of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but he shivered.
Lin Feng stared at the entrance of the village with his eyes blazing green, like a wolf howling with hunger.
At the entrance of the village, a pink jade peck, snow-white cute child, is trying to pull the tail of a big yellow dog, the child's voice is clear and loud: "Babble babble, don't run! "
The sound of the system in Lin Feng's mind kept going: "The talent system has been sorted out, and the No. 1 target information is as follows. "
"Root bone -> 10; understanding -> 8; mind -> 8; fortune -> 8."
"Summary: the target talent is very high, it is recommended to earn under the door, careful teaching, will be a pillar of the family. "
Lin Feng did not see anything else, staring at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
The root bone of 10, what does it mean?
For example, if someone else is running, it takes 100 meters from the start to the end, and the end is the same, the dot starts at 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder, the wolf he could have beaten when he was less than four years old was all peachy-faced.
Xiao Dot also found Lin Feng at this time, a blank look on his face, blinking big eyes, full of Meng Zhengtai.
Lin Feng smacked his mouth, the goods are not only strong to the anti-heaven, understanding, mind, fortune are also super-genius level.
Isn't it a bit stressful to receive such a cargo as an apprentice?
Lin Feng pondered, and a warm, sunny smile gradually appeared on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in a previous life saw him show such a smile, he would immediately hide as far away as possible.
Part 1, Chapter 1
The morning sun, shining through the light silver curtains, just fell on the bed, stinging her eyes.
At the party last night, she was happy to drink too much, and it was Lu Yanchen who took her away.
Time sat up, the thin silk was slipped off, a touch of red on the white sheet revealed, and his own body, greasy white skin covered with kiss marks.
It was the result of a night of pampering.
'i love you. '
When the love was strong, his moving words, as if still in the ear. Time face peach blossom, eyes shy, turned his head to look around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt off the bed, and when his legs touched the ground, he was weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the light came out again, Lu Yanchen also came back, calmly and slowly into the living room, slender and erect figure with a powerful and oppressive aura.
Time to look up, will fall into a pair of deep eyes, eyes as quiet as the unfathomable clear pool.
After all, it was the first time that such a most intimate relationship had taken place, and the time was inexplicably shy, downcast eyes did not dare to look at him.
When she was in a daze, she vaguely heard him say that he was going to surprise her.
Are you going to ask her to marry you?
Time is a bit overwhelmed, heart fluttering fluttering.
She had just uttered her voice when she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice: "Break up! "
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he was going to give her, was a breakup?
Is he teasing her, joking, or is he serious about breaking up?
A cry of extreme pain, hidden in the throat can not come out, a good half-sound, time to find their own voice,
Very light very light, as if low to the dust. "Break up, after we have a relationship. . . Lu Yanchen, what do you mean? "
"Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who held me to death to let me not stop, you also enjoyed last night. "
Time is as stunned as thunder!
She stared at the man who was so different from the one she remembered, trembled uncontrollably, and asked three difficult words, "Why? "
With that, he turned and looked out the window, a faint smile on his lips.
That smile, in the eyes of time, looks like mockery.
Time was as white as snow, the pain from the heart, pressing the nerve endings to the limbs, the vertigo-like darkness hit, and her fingertips clenched the palms of her hands to keep herself from fainting.
The air was suddenly bleak and damp, so cold that people shivered and suffocated, and could not stay for a minute.
Time is gone.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Rain country, Cangyun town Lingjia, the moon over the middle of the day.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated.
The fact that it took ten seconds for a man of God to affirm something was absolutely incredible, but it was also a testament to how incredible what had happened to him was.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and had unprecedented achievements in Dando, pioneering the art of "Three Fires" caused a revolution in the world of alchemy, and was revered as the "Dan Emperor".
But he was not satisfied, and he wanted to go further, to reach the fabled realm of vanity, to shatter the void, to become a god. To this end, he visited countless ancient sites, and finally entered the Valley of Black Blood, after many dangers to find a mysterious ancient tower.
He did not disappoint him, the ancient pagoda appeared on the golden text, is a supreme practice, called "Immortality of the Book of Heaven", practice to the highest level, the body will not be bad and immortal, coexist with heaven and earth, and live with the sun and moon!
But even with the martial arts cultivation of the cold world, I still feel that the Book of Immortality is obscure and difficult to understand, as if I were reading a heavenly book, and I have no clue.
He forcibly wrote down the exercise, and when he was about to study the ancient pagoda, it vibrated and released an immeasurable light, which shattered his body in an instant. But strangely, his soul did not dissipate, and he fell into a state of non-waking, non-dreaming, which lasted for tens of thousands of years.
For ten thousand years, his soul had been contemplating the Indestructible Book—he could do nothing else, and after ten thousand years, he finally realized the first level of this practice.
A strong person in the realm of heaven and man took 10,000 years to understand the first realm of a practice. What is this concept?
You should know that those who are strong in the realm of heaven and man generally have a lifespan of less than a thousand years. Normally, there is no one in the world who can cultivate the Indestructible Book, because they are already old and dead before they have even begun.
But Ling Han mastered the first level of the Immortal Book in this strange way, and then he suddenly came to life and was reborn in the body of a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"No matter what's going on, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only the cultivation of the second level of the body, and the waste material can no longer be waste material, I was once a strong person in the realm of heaven and man, stood at the top of the martial arts, and was a master of Dandao. If my qualifications were poor, I used elixirs to make up for it, and I did not believe that I could not return to the top."
"Besides, I can finally cultivate the Indestructible Book, which is a supreme practice, and even... it may not be owned by the mortal realm, but comes from the legendary divine realm, otherwise how could it take 10,000 years to understand the First Heavy Practice?"
"In this life, I will be able to surpass my predecessors and achieve the throne of God!"
"Besides, what's the matter with this body, which only reached the second level of cultivation at the age of sixteen? Is it because today's martial arts are too withered?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into the mind, this is the memory of another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people also fused together, regardless of each other.
'i get it. '
Ling Han nodded in his heart. The reason why he was only on the second level of the cultivation body now was because his spiritual root was so poor.
If you want to cultivate and become a warrior, there is a prerequisite: you must have spiritual roots. With spiritual roots, you can absorb the aura of heaven and earth, temper your body, and transform it into your own energy.
Some Linggen absorb Reiki quickly, some Linggen is slow, so Linggen is divided into heaven and earth Xuanhuang four major grades, each major grade is divided into the upper, middle and lower three minor grades, with the heaven grade being the best and the yellow grade the worst.
The key to judging the quality of the Ling root lies in the purity, the purer the better, but the Ling root of cold is both the five elements, the most messy, in the martial arts this is the most inferior Ling root, counted as a yellow lower grade can only be said to be reluctant, so he is now 16 years old but only cultivated to the second level of the body, while his peers have reached the fourth and fifth levels of the body.
The Ling Han of the previous life was the Tianlinggen, but also the Jiuyang Fire Linggen of the highest grade in heaven, coupled with the unmatched talent of Dan Dao, with Dan Fuwu, it took only two hundred years to reach the realm of heaven and man, which is an unprecedented record.
"The root of the Five Elements is the lowest spiritual root, and it is no wonder that the predecessors, despite their incomparable efforts, only cultivated at the second level of the body." "As far as I am concerned, the root of the Five Elements is a bit tricky, but with the help of elixirs, I will surely be able to return to the top for up to four hundred years!"
'Why! '
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, with an unbelievably shocked expression on his face, he was stunned for a long time, with a strong soul force to look inside his own spiritual roots in Dantian, the shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not a five-element mixed spiritual root, the five elements are perfectly balanced, forming a Taoist lotus! This is a five-element chaotic lotus, the best of the best, even rarer than the nine-yang fire spiritual root, which can be called a god-level spiritual root!" "The predecessors were slow to cultivate, because god-level spiritual roots require special exercises in order to bring out their true power."
"And I . . . just mastered a five-element Tianji Gong that matches the five-element Chaos Lotus!"
"A hundred years! No, it will only take fifty years for me to reach heaven and man again!"
Rao couldn't help but show his joy at the cultivation of the heavenly and human realms in Ling Han's previous life. The spiritual root was predestined from birth and cannot be changed the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, he visited countless ancient sites in order to break the void and become a god, and obtained a large number of mysteries of the exercises, of which the Five Elements Tianji Gong is one.
In the previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and in this life, he will create brilliance and create immortal myths.
'how did the predecessor die? '
Ling Han picked up the memory, and soon he was scowling.
The predecessor is the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family, his mother, grandparents died very early. And the Ling family is a martial arts family, every member of the people practice martial arts, but also respect martial arts, like Ling Dong behavior what can sit on the head of the family? Is his strength is the strongest, fight out.
Can Ling Han because of the problem of Linggen, from an early age will be regarded as waste wood, eat up the white eyes.
In order to give his son a bright future, Ling Dongxing and Huyang College reached an agreement that Huyang College would recruit Ling Han as a disciple and train him fully, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing would go into the Valley of Purple Light to find something for Huyang College that had been lost a long time ago.
Huyang College was built and run by the Yuguo Dynasty, with countless resources, and if it is fully trained, then the people who waste materials can also be promoted to Juyuan.
But the people of Huyang College can't be idiots, and if that thing is easy to get, how can they offer such good terms?
Ziguangdi Valley, dangerous, a wrong step can be killed, but for the sake of his son, Ling Dongxing set out seven days ago without looking back.
Yesterday, the people of Huyang College came and informed the Ling family that they would pick up the people today as agreed. But at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the archdeacon of the Ling family, came to discuss with his predecessor and asked him to give up this precious place to his grandson, Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius, the future is unlimited, such an opportunity can not be given to a waste material to waste.
Of course, the predecessor would not agree, this is his father's life in exchange for the opportunity! But Ling Chongkuan said it was a discussion, in fact, only to inform the predecessor, did not pay attention to his opinion at all.
The predecessor can't bear to strike, but Ling Chong Kuan is a strong person in the realm of Juyuan, a finger can suppress him, and he is not an opponent?
With just one punch, the former body was seriously injured, and then locked up in his room, apparently did not want him to make trouble in front of the people of Huyang College.
And the predecessor of the heavy hit was so angry and dead.
Ling Han snorted, it was so deceitful, his own father opened his life in exchange for this quota, was actually taken away by Ling Chong Kuan Ye Sun so?
This pair of shameless dog things!
I can't help it!
He got up from the bed, and suddenly his whole body ached--he was alive, but his wounds would not get better without a fight.
"Linggen is still traumatized!" Ling Han frowned, and Ling Chongkuan's blow caused damage to his Linggen, and Linggen was injured, which is a very troublesome thing, and ordinary medical stones are ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of elixirs that can repair Linggen, but the materials needed for four are too expensive to sell the whole Ling family for - and my Linggen is only lightly damaged, so I don't need such advanced elixirs."
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into dan, which is too much to do with the cultivation I'm doing at the second level of my body. Then there's only one choice: Yuanxin Fuling San, which requires only mixing the herbs in proportion and boiling them into a medicinal juice."
"First heal the injury, and then to stop Ling Chong Kuan Ye-sun, although I am not rare this quota, but I must not let my father's life in exchange for the opportunity to cheapen this pair of shameless Ye-sun!"
He sat down cross-kneed and began to run the Indestructible Book.
It was the first time he had performed what might have been a god-level exercise, but because he had been studying it for tens of thousands of years, he was now at ease.
Buzzing, his body suddenly gave birth to a strong vitality, a lot of energy consumption, but the injury is a rapid recovery.
In just a few minutes, he was dead from his injuries.
"It's worthy of not extinguishing the Book of Heaven, and I've only just begun to cultivate to have such a wonderful effect. It's just that it's completely different from other practices. The normal practice is to use the spiritual root to transform the aura of heaven and earth into the elemental force, but not extinguishing the Book of Heaven is just the opposite: it quenches the elemental force in the body and can heal injuries."
"When you reach the highest level of practice, it's not impossible to be immortal." "That's why it's called the Book of Heaven!" "Unfortunately, the current level isn't enough, otherwise I would be able to repair all the spiritual roots with the Book of Immortality."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked out of the window at the whitening sky, murmured: "Now, it's time to go for a while Ling Chongkuan that shameless old goods, give him a surprise. "
He put on his shoes, went to the door and opened it.
A tall figure appeared at the door to block his way, a man named Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Chongkuan's lackeys.
"Young Master Han, the archdeacon ordered, you have to stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan said with a smile. Although the man opposite was the son of the head of the family, he was a well-known waste material, and it was a joke in his eyes.
Ling Han's eyes were cold and he said, "Don't you dare stop me? "
It was you who stopped it, the archdeacon said, and you must not let Ling Han make trouble today. If necessary, you can beat him up! Zhang Yuanpi said with a smile, "This is the order of the archdeacon, and I ask Master Han not to embarrass me."
Ling Chongkuan this old dog is really cautious, beat him into a serious injury is still not assured, but also sent someone to guard the door, and this can see how important it is for Ling Chongkuan to get his grandson into Huyang College - but when this hope is lost, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and anger can be imagined.
"Get out of here!" Ling said coldly.
Snap!
Ling Han raised his hand is a slap in the face, coldly said: "What are you, tell you not to roll? "
What, he was actually slapped by a waste material? Zhang Yuan could not believe his face, the waste material dared to shoot at him, but also hit, which is the joke?
Snap!
Ling Han waved his hand again, and slapped him firmly.
"Baa-baa-baa-baa-baa"
The sound of an acoustic sheep bleat reverberated through the silent hills.
Li climbed up the hill on the seventh night. The night wind was sharp and cold, but he was sweating with anxiety. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the hill on his hands and feet, and the night was particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night appeared to be terrible, but Li Qinight's heart was anxious.
Li Qixiao, who came from a family of sharecroppers and poor parents, began herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qi spent the night tending his sheep as usual, but when he drove them back in the evening, he found that one sheep was missing, which made him very anxious. He hurried back to the hill to look for it, but he searched the whole hill and did not find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of Zhang Dahu's landlord, who lost a sheep, Li Qinight was distraught and worried.
Now the whole hill has been searched, there is no shadow of the sheep, at this time, Li Qinight thought of a place, there is only one place did not look for - the Fairy Cave!
Looking up at the night in front of the valley, like a wild beast, open its mouth at any time to choose people to devour, ears faintly heard the sound of wolves crying ghosts, overlooking the fairy cave blurred night, Li seven nights could not help but shiver.
Fairy Cave, the local notorious place, legend has it that there is a demon living in it, anyone who goes in, will be eaten, after going in, no one has ever been able to come out alive.
However, at this time, Zhang Dahu's cracking whip was reverberating in Li Qinight's ears, lost a sheep, Zhang Dahu will whip him to the skin!
"Well, well, well, the immortal crow of this seat has finally been refined, only the lack of soul, today is just to borrow your soul for a use!" I do not know how long, the fairy cave sounded a deep and gloomy voice.
In a moment, there was the rapid sound of flapping wings and a strange bird like a crow flew out of Fairy Hole.
"Fly, fly, this seat will use your soul to remember the burial place, fly over the relics, as long as the Nine Realms are still there, this seat must be found!"
Since then, between the heavens and the earth, there is a crow flying, into the burial place, into the fairy city, across the realm of evil. . . can not help themselves, flying over the nine realms, through all kinds of tribulations, millions of years do not die!
Time passes, times change, one invincible figure rises, one giant after another falls.Slowly, I don't know when, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow out of captivity, began to find a way to control their own destiny.
From the God of Medicine, to the Emperor of Flying Immortals, to the Emperor of Blood Seal Immortals, to the Emperor of Mingren Immortals, to the Emperor of Sun Swallowing Immortals, to the Emperor of Ice Feathers Immortals... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants rise, another generation of gods fall away, but, across thousands of years, the crow, still looms in the river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and the snow was falling.
As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw that he was sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, which was shaking a little, and there was the voice of a little girl talking softly beside him.
Outside the carriage, there was a cacophony of voices, shouts, cheers.
Lusheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back, from a state-owned enterprise to eat and die in the old oil, once drunk, woke up to the world.
It's been five days so far.
He sniffed, and the air smelled of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit.
"Oh, the white cinnamon wine in Osmanthus Fang is getting more and more fragrant," said the valet in the carriage.
Add to that a natural baby face and a small head, and you look like a ten-year-old.
Small face chubby, white and red, wearing a small green cotton skirt, small hands are still rubbing Lusheng ready to get out of the car to tie the hair rope.
This kind of hair rope is made of the bark of a very expensive tree, will naturally give off a light fragrance, but the only bad thing is that it will be hard when it is cold, need to be rubbed with hot hands to soften.
Lusheng smiled and said nothing, and the carriage soon stopped.
He lifted the curtain and got out of the car. The gray street was paved with bluestone bricks, each the size of a washbasin.
There was a lot of traffic on the streets, and some people were leading horses up and down the streets. The vendors and the girls and their families who came out to hang out were not shy about showing their faces and laughing.
Lu Sheng looked up at the winery in front of him. The white plaque was rectangular, and in the middle of it was written in three large characters: Osmanthus Fang.
"Inside, please! The A-size box is reserved for you!" A small group of smiling faces piled up to meet.
Lu Sheng nodded, a pair of rich boy style, from the side of the small hand to take the silver-edged white paper fan, gently shake, the fan unfolded, painted on the top of a pair of landscape smoke wave map, landscape one after another, light and dark overlap, and a look is the inscription of everyone's demeanor.
He followed Xiaoyou into the wine shop with ease.
The wine shop is divided into two floors, the first floor hall is sitting a lot of people listening to people singing.
A green-clad girl stood in the empty space, her voice gentle, and there was a middle-aged woman playing a lute on the side.
Singing is a three will preach, the three will preach is the marching general and the mountain fox woman's sad and beautiful love.
It was a pity that the drinkers were rude, and that only a few of the literati were able to understand, and the rest of them ignored the girl and the two.
Lu Sheng stopped and looked at the first floor so busy, he simply found a vacant seat on the first floor and sat down.
"Who ordered the three will pass? " He casually asked a small fight.
He has a different status in this Osmanthus Fang, if this Osmanthus Fang is equivalent to the high-class entertainment club on Earth, then he is the supreme vip customer here.
Such spending, in Jiuliancheng, a small city in the north, has been considered a top customer.
It's the Duke of Zhou. Zhou lacks the Duke of Zhou.
Lusheng did not trouble him, and waved him away.
As he sat down, his eyes swept around the crowd on the first floor, and he soon saw a pale, emaciated man, dressed in white, holding a golden ruffled fan in his hand.
"I guess I'm looking at the little girl who sings again," said Lu Sheng, shaking his head.
"The big dude warned him last time, and he's such a bad guy!" said Xiao Qiao with a grumble.
Lu Sheng smiled and said no more, and began to listen to the music quietly.
The dark red wooden table was quickly served with a table of wine and vegetables, and Lu Sheng took a pinch of lettuce and fried shredded meat and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of the white cinnamon liqueur, which is almost like a drink. The subtle sweet floral aroma blends together and is almost like drinking fruit juice.
This northern snow city, ice shrimp is the specialty here, in the thick ice hole casual fishing, you can play a large number of body translucent shrimp.
Ice shrimp are half the length of ordinary shrimp, but the taste is incomparable.
Of course, the price is also extremely expensive.
It's a luxury for ordinary people to eat once a month, and there's no place like him.
Lu Sheng ate the food, drank the wine, and listened to the music, but his mind was on other things.
It had been so many days since he had been in this world, which resembled ancient China, but he had observed that there were many oddities in it.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but then he found out he wasn't.
The customs, the festival climate, were far different from any dynastic region he knew.
The door of the winery opened again.
A line of strong men in skimpy outfits came in one after another and sat down at a table near the corner.
At a glance, these strong men knew that they were not locals, their dress was more like coming from the Central Plains, and their dress temperament was not as rough as that of the Northland.
At the head was a strong man with a shaved head, brass earrings, and a face full of flesh, but now he sighed.
"What's the big brother worried about, Lijiacun can't get through, we can take the second road, and it's OK to take a detour from Zhangcun," said the other man with a frown.
"You know what, when I came to rendezvous, I came from the other side of Zhangcun. The situation is similar to Lijiacun. A lot of people have died."
"What the hell is going on, big brother, you tell the brothers, and let us learn more," urged one of the men.
The shaven-headed man sighed again. "I don't know exactly how, but I know that several fishing villages on the shores of Suiyang Lake have had accidents.
Isn't it?
Lusheng's table was not far from them, and they could hear their undisguised chatter.
Originally, he was just listening to play, but I didn't expect these people to actually talk about the things of Shinto.
His road family in this life, in the north of the ice city is one of the largest families, the wealth of that is still less.
If you compare it on Earth, it's at least rich people with billions of dollars in assets.
These days out drinking, he also heard a lot of rumors about monsters and ghosts in the wine shop, but most of them are legends.
It was the first time anyone had experienced anything like this, so Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
Fortunately, the men did not hide it, and continued to chat loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"The water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes, more than a foot tall, green-faced fangs, covered with a lot of water plants, good boy, if it wasn't for your big brother I ran fast, now you wouldn't want to see me."
"Big brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost?" One man didn't believe it.
"Afraid it's not Big Brother you made up the story? "
Lu Sheng was amused to hear this, and thought it was just a braggart who had come out of nowhere. He had seen a lot of people like this all this time.
After eating and drinking, he asked Xiaoyou to take the song list of the girl and browse it at will.
Although the three will pass is good, but not the situation, he intends to change a more cheerful one.
Snap!
But just then, the bald man blushed and slapped the table.
A piece of bone that the water devil dropped on the ground! I picked it up secretly!
He carefully took a jade-like green stone out of his arms and patted it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of jade?" laughed a man.
"What is this?" he asked.
This brother, can you show me this thing?
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the sidelines.
Lu Sheng stood at the edge of the table with a smile on his face, his eyes sweeping over the green jade on the table.
"How dare you ask for it? It's the stuff the water ghost left behind," the shaved head marveled.
He's taking it out now, and he's going to throw it away in a minute.
After all, it's not something people leave behind, and it's really not worth the trouble to attract water ghosts.
"I'll have a look at it." Lu Sheng did not believe in any water ghosts, but looked at the jade sold well, not like an ordinary jade.
To know the general jade, shop stalls can be bought everywhere, is the jade scraps casually polished out, the price is extremely cheap.
But I don't know how, as soon as he saw the jade, he felt something was wrong.
Tsing Yi white fox Qiu, wearing a blue jade officer's hat, wearing is embroidered with silver thread moire black boots.
All dressed up can be consumed in this Osmanthus Fang for several months, even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
"If the prince wants it, it's not impossible. A denarius or two will do! "
Lusheng asked Xiaoqiao to take out one or two pieces of silver and put them on the table.
The shaved head decisively picked up the jade and shoved it into Lusheng's hand. A few people changed their eyes, got up and left.
Lusheng did not speak, but watched a few people leave, holding the jade in his hand, picked it up and looked at it carefully.
He shook his head. One or two pieces of silver was nothing to him. According to the memory of the body, his usual monthly expenses were at least a hundred or more pieces of silver. Occasionally, more might cost a thousand or two.
When he thought about it, he thought about it.
Taking the jade, he ignored the sight of the lively guests around him, but left the winery on small feet and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But just out of the wine shop, not half way, he was suddenly stunned, picked up the jade in the palm of his hand.
The jade melted in the palm of his hand, in the palm of his right hand.
In just a few seconds, it turned into a cloud of dark green mucus, and there was a faint cry from the mucus.
The whole mucus suddenly exploded into a cloud of green smoke, slowly drifting away from Lusheng in front of him.
He stood in the same place, stunned to see that the jade was still in his hands, but the green inside did not know when quietly disappeared.
He stood there for a moment, staring at the ceiling.
Xiaoqiao kept shouting at him.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses, and then looked at the jade in his hand, which was simply an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
'it's gone, back to the house! '
The two men got into the carriage, and the driver took his whip and gave it a few strokes, and the two black horses, covered with long hair, moved slowly.
In the car, Lusheng did not say a word, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hand. Xiaoqiao also found the strangeness of the stone at this time.
"I've been tricked again!" she muttered, and she didn't say much. The prince was fine this time. The biggest time he had been tricked before was for a so-called antique jug, which cost him thousands of pieces of silver and nearly killed him. This time it was only one or two pieces of silver, and the young master sometimes had more than that for a meal.
The carriage made its way back to the house, and as it passed the gate, Lusheng heard someone yelling outside.
"... before I heard that the water ghost was removed! A Taoist from the tourist side intervened to relieve the danger of the fishing village! "
Is there anyone from the court?
"I came early, and I heard that even the head of Ouyang, the governor of the city's Yamen, was almost trapped. Fortunately, I met a cloud traveler, and it is said that as soon as the Taoist shot, it was a flash of gold, and the water ghost Dangcang screamed, turned into green slime, and then exploded into smoke and dispersed."
'of course not! '
Lusheng heard the chatter of the officers guarding the gate.
From time to time he would deliberately pass by this gate, where the officers and guards were well informed and liked to brag about strange things.
"It's a coincidence. . . " Lusheng's face was silent.
His heart sank as he thought back to the jade.
Autumn 9999, East China Sea, Qingzhou City.
The Qingzhou Academy, the holy place of Qingzhou City, the nobles of Qingzhou City, and more than half of the powerful people in the Zongmen family all came out of the Qingzhou Academy. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to study in the Academy, and if they have the opportunity to study in the Academy, they will study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone is aware of this. In one of the rooms of the Qingzhou Academy, a teenager is sleeping on a table.
Above the lecture hall, a young girl in a long green dress also noticed the scene, a look of anger on her face, and stepped towards the young man who was sleeping.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, is an official student of Qingzhou College and a lecturer for foreign students. He has a beautiful face and a hot body. In the schoolhouse, a pair of eyes move with Qin Yi's moving posture. Even if he is angry, Qin Yi's steps are still graceful.
"This guy is sleeping in Sister Qin's lecture hall again." It seems that only then did he notice the sleeping figure, and many of the teenagers around him were a little speechless. Obviously, this is not the first time.
"With Sister Qin's looks and figure, even looking at her is enough to be pleasing to the eye, what the hell is going on in that guy's mind."
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer, no one, as for the reason, as long as you see her, you can understand, I don't know how many people worship her as a goddess, her lecture hall, is always full of students.
Qin Yi's steps were light, and she did not make a sound when she came to the young man's side. She stood in front of the table, looking at the sleeping face in front of her, and her beautiful face was covered with frost.
"Ye Futian." A soft voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
As if in a dream to hear someone call himself, Ye Futian's body moved, hands propped on the head, leisurely opened his eyes, hazy eyes, reflected in the eyes of the undulating peaks.
"It's big. " Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper, his voice was very soft, as if he were talking to himself, but in the quiet environment at the moment, the voice still seemed particularly abrupt, only for a moment, many eyes froze in the air, and then turned into anger.
"How dare he... blatantly belittle Sister Qin?"
A wave of angry eyes, like swords, made Ye Futian shudder, as if he sensed something was wrong, and his eyes moved up the inviting place, and then he saw a face as delicate as jade, but full of anger.
"Er..." Ye Futian a face of black lines, how is Qin Yi?
He looked back and saw a fifteen-year-old innocent girl glaring at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, and then scolded, was killed, no wonder the size is not right.
"Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian," Qin Yi coldly interrupted him, "Qingzhou Academy was founded in what context?
It was obvious that Qin Yi was going to avoid the embarrassment and change the subject, but her anger at the moment, Ye Futian could clearly feel, and he even vaguely felt the flow of a wisp of sword from Qin Yi's body, sharp and piercing, piercing every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, Emperor Donghuang unified the Eastern Shenzhou and ordered all the princes of the world to create the Wufu Academy and flourish the martial arts, and the Qingzhou Academy was founded in this context," Ye Futian replied. Of course, he was talking about the historical record, and there was another name in the wild history he had seen in his family, but the taboo name was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the professions of spiritual practice?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Spiritual practice can be divided into martial arts and magic, martial arts have many professions such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, magic practitioners have many professions such as mages, dan masters, refiners, and mages are divided into many lines, and of course there are gifted people who practice both martial arts and magic."
"You seem to have left out a profession," Qin Yi asked, looking solemn and serious.
The boy's face showed a touch of divine brilliance: "Shenzhou is recognized as the strongest profession, the providence of God, the destiny mage, with God-given talents, those with rare talents, such as summoners, masters of beasts, astrologers, the vast majority of them are from the destiny mage, regardless of the practice of martial arts, the destiny mage can have a stronger talent than others."
All the people around me are enchanted, destiny mage, legendary profession, destiny, God's favor. "Not only that, even destiny mage, is also naturally suitable for martial arts.
Qin Yimulu longing, then looked at the young man in front of him, and some anger said: "I did not expect you to know a lot about this. "
"Of course." Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said earnestly, "I am a destiny mage."
"Poof. . . " Not far away, a teenager who was drinking water choked violently, coughing violently, around a pair of eyes looking at Ye Futian, as if looking at idiots.
Is there such a brazen person in the world, worthy of the legend of the Qingzhou Academy, who not only openly molested Qin Shijie, but now falsely claims to be a destiny mage, in order to attract the attention of Qin Shijie?
However, what kind of person is he, who has been practicing in the matriculation palace for three years, who has been lingering in the first state of awakening, who is physically weak, who has obviously not completed his physical training, who is so mediocre that he can even be called a waste wood, and who says that he is a mage of destiny?
Qin Yi's chest heaved again, suddenly magnificent, she looked at Ye Futian angrily: "Since you are a destiny mage, the natural life palace has a soul, release the soul of your life palace for me to see. "
"My soul is still asleep and cannot be summoned, and it is because of my soul that I fall asleep in the lecture hall," Ye Futian replied calmly.
"Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted, staring deathly at the young man in front of him, and said, "Three years ago, when you were twelve years old and enrolled in the palace, I was still a foreign disciple, and when I visited your talent testing, your perception of Reiki as a natural product shocked the palace, and many teachers paid attention to it. However, for the past three years, you have not made any progress, and have always stayed in the first reunion state of awakening, doing nothing all day long, being lazy, and absent-minded in the lecture hall.
"In the past three years, whether it is the Spring or Autumn examination, you have all abstained, directly ranked the penultimate in the Academy, Ye Futian, do you have a heart of shame?"
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the whole school became silent, needles could be heard falling, and the eyes of all the people stared at Qin Yi's excited face, as if this was the first time they had seen Qin Shijie like this.
Ye Futian seemed to be calmed, and the pair of dark eyes stared at the delicate face flushed with anger in front of him.
"Three years?" Ye Futian whispered in his heart, did not realize that three years had passed unknowingly, and the guy in the palace of life, or no change at all, and he had some surprises, has always been indifferent to the iceberg sex goddess Qin Shijie, turned out to have been paying attention to him, from the year he stepped into the palace to detect the gift of perception of nature has begun.
The space was silent, Qin Yimei stared at the young man in front of him, a handsome face with clear lines, clean and deep eyes as bright as stars, and at the age of fifteen, in addition to being thin, he could find no other faults, and in three or two years, he would be a beautiful man.
"Is my tone too heavy?" Qin Yi saw Ye Futian in the corner of his eyes seemed to have a bit of loneliness, and could not help but secretly say in his heart, and his anger dissipated a bit.
"There's still a month to go until the Qiuyu big exam, and if you still abstain or fail this time, even if the rest of your life to intercede for you is useless, the palace will not allow you to continue to stay, do you understand?" Qin Yi continued, and the people in the schoolhouse stared, it seems that the palace is intolerable to that guy.
If so, I'm afraid it will go down in the annals of Qingzhou Academy, after all, it is rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy.
"He goes, I go," came an indifferent voice at the end, and many people looked at the young man sitting in the corner, with mixed eyes, envy, jealousy, adoration, fear.
"It has been decided in the palace that the rest of his life does not need to participate in next year's Spring Festival, and he can choose any palace of the palace, the Order of the Knights, and the Palace of Magic to practice. His future can no longer be affected by you." Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed. His fate and that of the rest of his life will eventually go in completely different directions.
The corner of his mouth drew a faint smile, some cynicism.
"Shut up. . . " Sitting in the back, Yusheng stood up, his eyes shining with a bright sharp light, stabbing Qin Yi.
"Sit down. " Ye Futian did not return, said faintly, the rest of his eyes lagged, looking at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words to him, is an iron order.
"I decided to..." Ye Futian's face showed a slightly frivolous smile, looking at Qin Yidao: "officially participate in this year's autumn examination. "
Behind, there was a bright light in the eyes of the rest of life.
Three years on, he's finally, going to be serious?
After three years of practice in Qingzhou Gakuen Palace, the people of Gakuen Palace only knew that he was extremely gifted for the rest of his life. He was gifted with the perception of gold attributes, and he was gifted with martial arts. Although he was a foreign disciple, his realm was higher than many lecturers.
But who really knows the sleeping teenager?
"You are weak, you are still in the state of awakening the first reunion, even if you take the autumn examination, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian, sighed in his heart, even now to rise, I am afraid it is still too late.
"What if it's over?" Ye Futian didn't seem to know himself at all, and there was a strong confidence in his tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall later," Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed a strange brilliance, looking at the shadow and fiery figure in front of him, his eyes involuntarily looked at the place where he should not look, weak way: "Do you want to do anything? "
"This guy, what does this mean..." Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where do you look?" It seems to notice the look in Ye Futian's eyes, many people have the urge to run away, he even dared to molest Qin Shijie?
Qin Yi naturally also noticed the look in Ye Futian's eyes, and the compassion that had just been born was gone in an instant. The beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian fiercely, and he gritted his teeth and said, "Whatever you want to do, you can do it!"
Deep in the mountains and forests, all demons converge.
For the first time, the tribes put aside their enmity and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes... all kinds of demons came together. For a time, the whole forest was all kinds of demons or large or small or delicate or enchanting voices. At the top was sitting ten demon kings, these ten demon world's top strong, at this time there was the same heavy look between the eyebrows.
"Demons, I think you know what has happened here recently.The Tiger Clan has always been strong, and the first thing the Tiger King said was to quiet the demons. "We belong to the same category of demons. In such a crisis, I think all clans should put aside their preconceived ideas, join hands with one voice, and work together to solve the current problems.
What is the purpose?
"Is there any need to guess?" snorted the Tiger King. "Who but the monks of the six sects and three sects would do such a thing, and have we had fewer demons slaughtered by him over the years?"
"But we have always been clear with these Xiuxianmen, so why did they suddenly block my way out of the border?"
"They didn't eat the first son of their three clans and six factions," the Snake King guessed. "They didn't have to tear their faces like that, did they?
"Yes!" said the Leopard King indignantly. "After all these years, which demon hasn't eaten a mortal, how can the three sects and six factions suddenly be in trouble? I don't think it's them."
"Yes, everyone knows that the demons of our realm are detrimental to their cultivation, so they never go near the border forest, and how can they stay here all the time?"
"But... apart from the six factions and three clans, who has the strength to kill all the demons out of bounds within three months?"
The Eagle King nodded, as if remembering something, and his feathers trembled. "I have heard that the demons who have gone out of the realm have all died without bones, and that those who have been stripped of their skins have been cooked, and that there are dried corpses in the trees of shame in the forest.
The Tiger King slapped the arm of the stone chair and stood up angrily. "Fellow demon kings, I think it's better to kill and find out together than to guess who did it. I don't believe it. No matter how high they cultivate, they can still stop this army of ten thousand demons.
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings suddenly showed an expression of approval, and indeed, rather than be frightened, it was better to take the initiative.
The Deer King was the first to respond, "My son is dead at their hands, and it is better to go out and kill him than to guess here and there. What about the three sects and six factions? When have we demons ever been afraid of them!"
"Isn't that why we are gathered here today, to kill and avenge the death of one of our own kind, whoever he may be?" Even the least daring Rabbit King stood up and responded, but the Rabbits were the deadliest.
"Yes, this revenge is not repaid, it is a demon! "
"The demons of the people are on top, and I will swear vengeance on them. "
Other demon kings have also stood up to respond, and even the demons of all ethnic groups on standby around them, also have the appearance of the appearance of the bright claws of the bright claws, excitedly shouted the slogan of revenge, Yanran a whole army ready to go.
"What. . . " a thin voice suddenly rang out in the demon group, "I don't think I have to go. "
In the wave of indignation, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared, although it was not loud, but it succeeded in attracting the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, the eyes of all the demons pierced.
"Who is it? " The tiger king is a tiger roar, searching for this seedless monster.
The demons looked around, clearly the most acute of the five senses demons, but for a long time did not find the voice of the man.
"Who the hell just spoke?" The Tiger King was a little angry. "Where did the demon come from? There's a kind of king to stand up!"
'i'm here, here! '
The demons again toured around several times, still did not see who the voice was.
"Here, here..." the voice repeated, "left, left, wrong... over, a little to the right, wrong, look here, look here!"
The demons followed the voice and looked around several times, but still did not find the voice.
Oh, come on, I'm here!
It was only with a sigh that a figure suddenly climbed on to the high platform on which the demon king sat, and the demons saw the man who had spoken.
It was a woman in a gray, floppy robe, her shoulders limp, her eyes dull and falling, the whole person with a languid air, very short and thin, with a yellowish complexion.
A word "weak" appeared in the minds of the demons at the same time, too weak! Even the body of the demon was pathetically weak, as if any demon breathed air, can blow her away.
No wonder the demons just looked for a long time did not find this person, such a demon is too inconspicuous.
The blood-thirsty Tiger King couldn't see it, and with a squirt of his nose, he said fiercely, "Well, you're a seedless boy, and just a few monks have scared you, and you're still like this." Demon can take shape, but this is a meeting of all demons, so most of the demons here have shown some prototypes to distinguish between races, and only she has maintained a full human form, which makes the Tiger King even more displeased, "Don't dare to show people in their original form, what kind of demon are you?" "I'm human."
I am a human being, replied the woman.
Shemale? The Tiger King was stunned for a moment. What kind of shemale is shemale? Never heard of it!
"What a mess of weak demons, dare to come to the meeting of all demons. " Tiger King glared at the woman indignantly. "You are a seedless demon, stop talking nonsense here, affect my morale to go to revenge. "
"No, I'm serious. " The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders drooped unconsciously, looking weaker. "You really don't have to go out looking for revenge. "
The Tiger King was angry and roared, "Believe it or not I ate you little devil. "
"You ate me, and you didn't have to run in vain?
What do you mean?
"I mean, the guy you were talking about who kills monsters and is inferior to animals..." She sighed, patted her dusty robe and looked up, still slouched, but pointed to her nose. "It could be me! "
There was silence for three seconds.
'kill her! '
At the same time, the demons reacted and pounced on the woman.
Small animals or something - what a hassle!
Five minutes later.
-- The First and Last Banshee Congress, the end!
Chapter 1 Tony Downe?
The loud noise stimulated the nerves in the brain, and the decibels were so loud that they could cause deafness. A blinding white light shone into the eyes, and the sun ached.
Dawn couldn't help but squint, but the white light didn't die, but spread to the whole world.
What the fuck is going on here? Am I in a rock club?
Cursing in his heart, Dawn opened his eyes and was met by a large, menacing face. It was black with sweat, and the hot air from the two black holes under its broad nose seemed to have reached his face. The white teeth in its gaping mouth were as frightening as those of a wild animal, and of course the bad breath that spewed from it.
What followed was a violent, head-on collision. Dawn felt as if he had been punched in the jaw and fell backwards.
The weight of the two men fell on the poor plastic bottles, and they disintegrated under their weight. White water sprayed out, and even a column of water shot out of the mouth of one of the bottles, directly into the faces of the "pond fish" behind it, and the other "pond fish" shot up like frightened sparrows.
'Damn it! '
'it's fucking hell! '
'What's going on here? '
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
'how do you kick it? '
Dawn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the strange faces around him, some of them anxious, some of them gloating, and some of them covering their faces in silence. There was still a lot of noise, but the great uproar had changed its tone, and there were boos and laughter.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on?
Wait, let's see what's on the sidelines?The announcer suddenly got excited and stood up and looked down from the top stand, "Forest's main striker, David Johnson, has been knocked into the sideline coach's box in a struggle with an opposing player, and poor coach Tony Downe is standing on the sidelines directing the game...Oh, look at the horror on the ground, it's a Mars collision!
Dawn lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaked and crumpled with grass clippings and dirt, looking like a freshly used rag.
A big-nosed, black-bearded, Mario-like man appeared in his field of vision, and he nimbly pulled white gloves out of the back-colored leather bag he was carrying and put them on, then began to examine Dawn's body.
Heck, it looks like he landed on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me?" He held out his hand and waved it in front of Dawn's eyes, his tone visibly more anxious than before.
At the same time, the TV screen began to repeat the scene.
David Johansen was pushed hard by the No.14 in a fierce tussle, and the big black man slanted towards Tony Downe, who was standing on the sidelines. But the strange thing was that Downe, who had plenty of time to dodge, was standing on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his players crash into him.
The Forest players huddled anxiously around the coach's bench, with Downe lying on the ground at the centre of the crowd, and David Johansen, the black striker who had made the mistake, kneeling on the ground in prayer. If his coach had anything to do with it, he would have been the first player to kill his manager on the pitch.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood on the pitch, arms folded, watching the action, there were also curious people who took on the role of scouts for the whole team, running to watch the action and then running back to share the crowd with their team-mates.
The Forest fans in the stands did not seem to be worried about the life or death of their manager. They took the opportunity to swear loudly at their team's poor performance, with words beginning with "F" or "s" coming out of their mouths and countless raised middle fingers dazzling the big screen with "0:2".
Forest's team doctor, Gary F1eming, was still trying his best. He had just seen Tony's eyeball move, so why didn't he react?
He patted Tony Downe on the face, still unresponsive. The team's acting head coach lay on the ground like a waxwork, his mouth slightly open and his eyes wide, as if he had seen something startling.
The blue sky, the white clouds like cotton candy, the faces with different skin tones and expressions, the noisy environment, all this is very familiar, but so strange, as if thousands of miles away from their own.
The referee signalled to the team doctor to see to it that he could not suspend the game indefinitely because of an off-field injury. He whistled for the players to return to the pitch and the game to continue, even though the Forest players had no desire to fight.
"But he might even be in danger!" Fleming yelled at the umpire, furious at his indifference, pointing at Downe, who was still lying on the ground.
"Then you call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!" The referee shot back without a hint of weakness. "Besides, he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you say," he said, pointing behind Fleming and running back onto the pitch.
Fleming turned back to see Dawn standing up slowly, touching the back of his head, and he hurried up to help him.How are you feeling, Tony?
Dawn asked blankly, "Where is this?"
Fleming turned and swore an expletive, which had been a bad thing lately.Des, Des, you come here!He beckoned a golden man from the coach's bench over.
A man called "Des" came running. "How's Tony?
"It's terrible. He even asked me where I was just now.
Des's reaction was the same as Fleming's, and he turned his head and cursed.
"I suspect it was the result of the impact on the back of his head when he fell to the ground. "
Is it bad, Gary?Des bit his lip and looked grave.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad," Fleming shook his head.
'What does that mean? '
"The good thing is that he's only going to have a short memory loss, and he'll get over it with a little rest. The bad thing...do you need me to say more?"
Des waved his hand to show that he understood. "Take him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we're behind, and we need him to direct the game..." he said, turning his head to look at Tony Downe next to him, but he was surprised that Downe was now moving slowly alone towards the players' tunnel.
"Hey!" Des hurriedly dropped Fleming and ran up to grab his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going? " In the noisy environment, Des's teeth-and-claws yelling actually had the effect of a "whisper."
Dawn looked back at Des blankly, a look that chilled Des's heart, and now the setting sun was shining brightly above them, but he couldn't see any brilliance in those eyes.
Tony, where are you going?Des repeated.
"I... I don't know, maybe... it's home..." Dawn muttered, still trying to break free of Des's hand.
Fleming also came running from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now, we're in the game, you're the manager, you're in charge of the team!"
The three men's tug at the entrance drew attention from the benches of both teams, as well as from the stands, and even the players on the field would glance here from time to time.
Dawn burst out laughing: "I'm a coach?" This is ridiculous, how can I be a coach... even though I'm a fan and play Football Manager a lot, how can I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a goddamn nightmare!
"He's Des, desa1ker, a former England international who played as a centre-back and only retired from the team last season, and now he's your colleague, your assistant," Fleming said as he introduced the pair to each other for the first time.
Dawn nodded, then said to Des, "OK, now you're directing the game for me, and I'm going to take a break." With that, he wrenched Des's hand away, ignoring the loud boos and the two flabbergasted people behind him, and walked into the hallway.
Fleming looked at Dawn's back and then at Des Walker.
With a heavy sigh, Walker turned and walked back. "This game can't be played! "
Downe sat in the passageway, his back to the wall, staring blankly at his surroundings. Across from him on the white wall was a large sign, with three wavy curves beneath a large red "mushroom" and the English word "Forest."
Where am I? What the hell is going on?
Dawn touched the back of his head, where there was still a dull pain.
***, sneak up on Laozi, hit Laozi in the back!
"What's my name?" he muttered, but suddenly he covered his mouth, and it was only then that he realized that he had been speaking English, the language of birds.
"S * * *, how did this happen?"
Dawn, who had finally learned where he was, froze again, so strangely that his brain stopped responding after the load, and it seemed to have nothing to do with him.
That was the scene at the City Stadium this afternoon when Forest's acting manager, Tony Downe, was knocked down by one of his players while standing on the sidelines and appeared to fall into a brief coma, only to walk straight into the players' tunnel when he got up again.
In the dim light of the streetlights outside, Dawn stood in the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. A middle-aged ghost with a straight, high nose, deep, blue eyes, and a curvy brown head.
Tang, who is actually from Sichuan, China, is only twenty-six years old, and the man in the mirror even has a tattoo!Thirty-four years old!This is Tony Tang's age.
Not only had he inexplicably stooped to an Englishman, he had travelled forward four years and three months!
Although he never thought he was handsome enough to attract the attention of many women.
He snarled at the mirror, then smashed it with a blow, and it suddenly became a million pieces of himself, and there was a clatter as the pieces fell to the ground, and a million faces looked at Dawn as if they were laughing at him.
Dawn felt a little dizzy, and he stepped back and leaned against the smooth wall, gasping for breath.
After a few minutes of silence in the dark, Dawn calmed down and decided not to think about such a complicated problem. He had a habit in China of finding a place to drink when things went wrong. Chengdu was full of bars, and he might be able to find a one-night stand or something. He had a habit of thinking of Nottingham as Chengdu in his mind, and decided to go out and find a bar to drown his sorrows.
Glancing at the hazy sky outside, he put on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
"Forest have had a bad year recently, losing 3-0 at home to underdogs Walsall. Paul Hart, who had high hopes for the club, failed to deliver and submitted his resignation to chairman nige1doughty after the last round, which was quickly approved."
Today's sports news is being broadcast on a TV fixed on a high shelf, with the emphasis, naturally, on what's happening on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There were boos in the noisy bar.
A drunken man pointed his middle finger at the TV. "That Tony Downe I know him, the little hairy boy who used to work for Paul Hart in the youth team.
The drunk had just finished his tirade when Dawn pushed through the door. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the people who were drinking and chatting in the bar. They all turned their eyes to the door, and when they saw who it was, they were surprised, and then their faces lit up with playful smiles.
A typical English middle-aged man stood up with a glass of wine and shouted, "Our Tony Downe coach is here! "
"Woof!" A "welcome" hissed from the mouths of the people inside the bar.
The middle-aged man raised his glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately raised their glasses in agreement.Cheers!
The other man, who was clearly drunk, stood up crookedly, walked over to Downe, held a beer bottle to his mouth, belched, and asked, "Coach Tony Downe, that was a beautiful defensive play, but the referee and public opinion obviously didn't think so..."
He turned his head and laughed at the others in the bar.
So he pushed away the bottle in front of him with a sullen face, then went straight to the bar and said to the bartender, "A bottle, please..." He habitually wanted to say "Xiao Er" - a small bottle of Erpantou, although he was from Sichuan, but he had gone to college in the north and had liked the strong drink since then - but he could not speak "Xiao Er" in English, and more importantly he quickly realized that this was in England, not China. He bowed his head and muttered a curse, then changed his words, "The strongest drink."
The others, who had been watching him, raised their voices when they heard him say that he wanted the strongest drink.
How dare Tony, the coward, drink too?
The young bartender was at a loss as to what to do with the exuberant customers. He tried to get a drink but was stopped by the drunkards who shouted, "Get him juice!
"No, no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ahahaha!" He yelled.
Alarmed by the noise outside, the owner of the bar came downstairs and stood on the landing, where he saw almost all the customers who had not fallen asleep at their tables gathered around the bar, and in the middle of them sat a man wrapped in a black windbreaker, who was being laughed at heartily by the drunkards.
His loud voice suddenly quieted the tavern, and the drunkards, who had been arrogant, fell silent when they saw the man standing behind them.
Donn wondered who could have brought the group down with a single word. He turned his head slightly and saw a man coming out of the shadows at the top of the stairs.
The young bartender quickly pointed to Dawn and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a stiff drink. "
When the visitor saw who was sitting, he was a little surprised, but he said, "Just give it to him. "
"But . . . but they won't let . . . " The bartender looked awkwardly at the drunks who had returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, but everyone he caught his eye kept their heads down, either pretending to be asleep or drinking hard with their heads down. Dawn became more and more interested in the able middle-aged man in front of him.
"I don't see any objection. Pour him a Scotch and I'll have a treat," the barman said, turning to Dawn. "Single or double?"
The drunkards laughed as they looked on.
The barman smiled. "I forgot who you were..." He filled the glass with half a shot of golden whiskey, then half a shot of water, and handed it to Dawn. "This is the wine of my hometown."
Dawn took a sip and immediately coughed. He rarely drank foreign wine, and the pure Scotch had a strong smell of coke.
There was a schadenfreude of laughter inside the bar.
"The Tony Downe I know never drinks and lives like a true old-fashioned Puritan, and he wouldn't look at me the way he does now, don't you know who I am?" The man stared at Downe, who seemed to see through the man himself.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Er... me," Dawn said, bowing his head and taking another sip. This time he didn't dare let the liquid linger in his throat for more than a second.
There was a knock at the door.
The man touched the back of his head to show understanding.
Someone nearby helped Dawn out, and a voice shouted: "It looks like our coach Tony has really broken his head!The man sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, two-time European Cup winner and 1978 Stanley Matthews Award winner Mr Kenny Burns!He's a hundred times better than you ass!"
The man behind him laughs and shouts, "Stupid ass, stupid ass," but the object of his derision jerks back and spills the last half of his glass. The golden scotch glints brilliantly in the light, arcs beautifully through the air, and hits the hapless man in the face with the precision of a David Beckham right-footed free-kick.
His swear words were knocked back by a thick glass, and Dawn pounced on him with a swiftness that no one could have imagined. He could bear it no longer; he had come to this place inexplicably, had travelled four and a half years inexplicably, had been ridiculed and insulted inexplicably... and now he wanted to find someone to take it out on, whether he knocked someone else down or someone else knocked him down.
The two men crashed into the table behind them, and the empty bottle fell and shattered to the ground with a crunch.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone froze. They didn't expect Tony Downe, who had just been acting like a coward, to explode.
One of the first to react was Kenny Burns, the owner of the bar, who shoved a fat man standing next to the bar and shouted, "What are you doing standing there?
In addition to the grim appearance on the ground, blood was already seeping from the forehead of the man who had been beaten, and a red circle appeared there, the mark of the mouth of the cup; in addition to that, his left cheek was as red as if he had been drunk.
Dawn, on the other hand, had done nothing but mess up his head and clothes, and when he was pulled up, he seemed to have finished his anger, and instead of throwing himself into a fight, he tidied up his clothes and head, and spat at the hapless creature who was being held up by his companion, "I don't care who you are, don't mess with me."
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry for the mess you've made here. It's been a s * * * day..." He was annoyed at the thought of being crossed. "Some other day... I'll come and apologize in person, and don't worry about making amends."
Then, without waiting for any sign from the owner of the bar, he turned and went to the door, and as he passed the fat man, he said sarcastically, "Keep your milk for yourself, fat pig."
Everyone watched him push through the door, but no one thought to stop him, so they watched him leave, leaving a mess.
There was silence in the bar. Then the drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room and the mess, and asked confusedly, "Did I miss anything? "
I don't want to be a jerk! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Dawn shout that?
Since his "past life" is quite bad, why not use this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, but he has watched football for more than ten years, football manager games have been played in every generation, how much to understand the nature of the work of some coaches, this is not a good opportunity to challenge?
He no longer has to think about the boring question of why God chose him. He now just has to think about how to be more like a real professional coach. It's going to be hard, but it's worth trying.
"Hey, buddy. You broke into my house without my permission, and I'm going to call the police if you don't leave!"
Dawn looked blankly at the old man standing across from him, holding many, many newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten hamburger in his hand.
"Is this... your home?" He pointed to the bench below him.
'of course. '
"Ah, I'm sorry to interrupt..." Dawn got up from the chair, and the other man immediately sat down and lay down, covering himself with the papers in his arms and pressing them firmly between the back of the chair and his body.
Looking at the beggar contentedly eating a hamburger and lying in his "newspaper den," Dawn even had to thank God for not allowing himself to be "possessed" by him.
A taxi dropped off a passenger in front of him, and he quickly stepped forward and got in. Dawn took one last look at the beggar, who was enjoying his "dinner" in the cold wind, and asked the driver to take him back to his strange home.
Starting today, a whole new world is slowly unfolding before Dawn's eyes. It's a sunny Saturday morning, and Zhao Yao is on his way to get sterilized. . . to get his cat sterilized.
In the bag was a yellow cat, also known as an orange cat, one of the pastoral cats, whose head, back, and limbs were covered in layers of yellow and orange markings.
Chest and stomach is a large fluffy white hair, the tips of the limbs are white, it is said that the snow white gloves have a killing effect on girls, will control their brain waves, let them make "ah ~ ~ ah ~ ~" sound.
It was a male cat, but it had big eyes and a very girly look.
At this point, the cat was howling at the top of its lungs. Most domestic cats are very housebound and only want to stay at home for the rest of their lives. Moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao could only comfort the cat with his voice.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly streaked through outer space, gradually flying over China, the surface of the meteor shimmered with an eerie sheen, as if constantly emitting some kind of rays into the surrounding void.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag to the front desk: "Male cat neutered, made an appointment before, surname Zhao. "
"You haven't been to us before looking at the records. You need to fill in the information field on the medical record card. "
In outer space, the meteor slowly crossed the sky over the land of China, and began to move in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Where the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies, and their eyes flashed a deep luster, just like the luster emitted by the meteor.
Then the matcha suddenly moved, struggling to jump up, and darted towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse let out a cry of surprise, but Zhao Yao on the other side of the darted out and grabbed the fleeing matcha.
Zhao Yao was still too slow to catch the body of the matcha, but only the tail of the matcha.
Tail was scratched, matcha let out a roar, instinctively turned his head is to Zhao Yao a bite, this is the instinct of cats, the speed is also extremely fast, an instant on the back of Zhao Yao's hand opened a hole, Zhao Yao back of the hand pain, also immediately released the palm.
Perhaps knowing that he was in trouble, Matcha did not continue to run away, but curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some uneasiness.
Zhao Yao hugged the matcha and said, "Silly cat, what do you bite, rebel, right! "
There was a sudden flash of light in the eyes of the matcha cat, and the blood stains on the teeth disappeared completely.
Zhao Yao also felt a sudden dizziness in his head, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but it was a little dazed, and he saw only a smooth patch on the back of his hand, where there was a wound and blood.
The little nurse on the other side took the cat and said, "Good matcha, it's all right, it'll be all right in a while, don't be nervous. "
The cry was heard in Zhao Yao's ears, but it was not a simple cat meow, but turned into understandable words.
Zhao Yao pointed to the matcha in front of him with a shocked face and said, "This... this... this cat speaks!"
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you all right? "
"Didn't you hear it?" Zhao Yao said quickly, "It's... it's talking."
The little nurse frowned, and looked at Zhao Yao more and more strange.
Can you understand me meow?
'take me home! '
"Woof woof woof, scared pee ~ meow."
Zhao Yao suddenly opened his mouth wide, looked at the side of the unconscious, still comforting the matcha nurse, looked at the matcha and said: "Can you understand me? "
"Can understand, can understand, I want to go home, take me home, whine whine whine."
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat.
Ignoring the strange eyes of the little nurse, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into the bag, trotting all the way out of the hospital.
In the rental house, the matcha cat returned to the familiar environment and immediately relaxed, lying on the coffee table began to lick his little white hands, eyes narrowed, a relaxed face. For cats, licking fur is always very suitable for relaxation behavior.
Before the tea table, Zhao Yao was staring at the matcha cat in front of him, and said tentatively, "Can you still talk? "
He stood up and said, "Does the master want to play games? "
Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said, somewhat bewildered, "When did you learn to speak?"
Looking at the face of an innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao a face of weird.
Matcha cat, however, did not feel weird about the situation in front of him, suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinting and rubbing Zhao Yao's body, milk voice: "Play games with me. "
Looking at the matcha cat in front of him, who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao touched his partner's head, and the latter showed a purr of enjoyment.
You are only one year old, and now you are only five years old.Zhao Yao's mouth turned into a smile.You are still a child, and that seems to be good.
A month later, it was nine o'clock at night.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes, and sat down on the sofa.
He lived in this rental house, although only 30 square meters, but fully furnished, is a newlywed couple in the past house, and very close to the company, let him work overtime every day do not have to worry about traffic problems, so although the rent is not cheap, but still let Zhao Yao out of the will.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unknowingly crawled to his side and rubbed his head on his arm, a look of affection and flattery.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed Matcha's head, and the latter showed a look of enjoyment.
But just then, the phone on the sofa was pushed over by the matcha.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, her thin white arms resting on her small head, and her long black satin-like hair was flowing in the air, revealing half of her bright little girlish face.
What's going on?
There was a steady stream of dry heat burning her little face, making her feel uncomfortable, and today she came to the imperial capital from Yecheng, and just now she drank a glass of boiled water handed by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
"No, Tang Mo'er jumped down, go after her, can't let her run! "
Tang Moer a stirring spirit, sober more than half, Han Xiaowan actually designed her!
What should I do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man, as if grasping at a straw, "Sir, help me, I've been drugged, and there are some men behind me who want to forcefully explode me. "
The man's narrow, cold eyes glanced over the girl's back at the men, and though they were light, they were chilling.
The men were punks who had seen the world. They had seen the man who covered the headlines of financial magazines and controlled the lifeblood of the imperial economy on television.
Gu ink cold.
It was a man they could not afford to provoke, so they turned and ran.In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle was taking place. Angels with flaming wings, knights in heavy armor, crusaders with golden swords, were fighting an evil army of smoky bone dragons, hideous and terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
It is certainly a strange imagination to imagine that the battle between the two sides was not fought on a plain strewn with fire and smoke, or in a graveyard strewn with bones, but in a dark, invisible darkness.
But what was more strange was that beyond the battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, a few faint voices could be heard whispering?
Do it, do it quickly! My God!
"You can control your Death Knight before you talk about anyone else! The Death Knight is fighting with the Mobile Bunker!!"
Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy?
When the battle was over, the angels, knights, and scattered skeletons that had been on the battlefield disappeared into the darkness of the background, and once again there was absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.
But a few voices continued to communicate something, and even more voices joined in.
"My teammates are a bunch of pigs! All the dogs are better than them! Not only does it not help the situation, but it also robs the command of the core troops..." said the voice of the previous failure.
"Bah! Clearly the undead creatures are too weak, if it were my demon army, it would be different. . . " Another voice did not show any weakness in the counterattack, and made such a forced excuse for his wrong command: "I thought the death knights could easily take out those bunkers. "
Hearing this voice, the darkness could not help but hear a few soft laughs, and the two sides of the argument suddenly lost their temper, helplessly said to the victorious side: "Skill is not as good as man, Ganbai downwind. "
And the winner now engaged in a round of graceless ridicule?
Haha! Justice will triumph over evil in the end!
"In the face of our power, whether undead or demons, even the gods will kill you!"
Such words are undoubtedly more infuriating, had calmed down the two sides immediately launched a new round of scolding, and outside the new battlefield of the victorious side of the third person, some helplessly asked: "Should I not organize this round of games? "
The original before that pair of tragic and heroic war, even just a game?
A voice not involved in the game responded, "It's amazing to be able to simulate a realistic war with your mind and make us onlookers feel like we're actually there. You're really good at surprising us, I hope."
Faced with the sudden thanks, the man known as Hope replied quietly, "You're overpaid. It's just a pastime. "
Yes, the great battle, which was like a life-and-death showdown between good and evil, was only a diversion, adding only a little pleasure to the endless prison.
This is the realm of the void beyond the plane of reality. It is supposed to be an eternally dark, cold, silent Jedi, where no living thing can survive, a realm more terrible than death.
Yet in such a place, a place of death that could not contain any living being, a group of indeterminate creatures lived tenaciously, having lost their bodies, leaving only the last of their consciousness in the void.
They call themselves the Voidwalkers, imprisoned forever in this prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the most powerful of all races and realms, the mages who reached the apex of magic, the warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the preachers who were steadfast and noble, the demons who ruled hell, the lichs who controlled souls, and so on, and so on, and they have left their names in the history of all planes.
Many people think that they are long dead, only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they do not know that this group of old monsters strong enough to be described as perverted, in fact, imprisoned in the endless void beyond the plane, has spent incalculable years there, and seems to be imprisoned here forever, the seemingly thin barrier between the plane of reality and the void, is a wall of sighs that they will never be able to break through, Rao is that they once had the power is so strong, but there is nothing they can do about it.
But they never gave up hope of escape, for among the 33 Voidwalkers there was a very special being, the Fifth, code-named Hope.
Hope, whose original name was Baiyi, did not come from the dimensions of human existence beyond the void, but from a strange place called Earth. He used to be the editor of a small news website, and his daily job was to pick up news from other websites at home and abroad, and then replace it with something like a bombshell!
Men will shed tears, women will be silent and so on the title of their own website, a noisy and tedious work.
Later because of an accident life and death of Bai Yi, consciousness did not immediately disappear, but under the yin and yang error into this mysterious void, met several other void walkers, and finally so strong to survive until this moment.
The Voidwalkers insisted that he, from a different world, would be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "You are the only one who is different and wants to get out of here, you are our only chance, I believe that, that's why I call you by the code name Hope," the first Voidwalker, the code name Sorcerer, had said to him.
They have always believed in this, that they will one day see the light of day, even though they have been imprisoned for countless years, hundreds of years? thousands of years?
Talking or discussing is obviously not enough to survive thousands of years in this immutable prison without going insane. In fact, the primary means by which the Voidwalkers spend their time is an activity called memory-sharing.
The activity is based on a mindfulness technique called memory recall, which allows people to recall every detail of their experience, even every punctuation mark on a newspaper.
And then through a certain amount of editing, you get rid of the memories that you don't want other people to see, such as having sex with a woman or having sex with your right or left hand, and then you exchange the memories with the other person, so it's like watching a really long movie about someone else's life, and it's a great way to pass the time.
The memory of the thirty-three Voidwalkers was equivalent to having lived thirty-three lives, and even though he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid confusion, retaining only their knowledge and experience, his state of mind had sifted away all the weaknesses of naivety and impetuousness during the thirty-three lives, and he had become mature and stable, no longer an ordinary person on Earth.
That's why the other Voidwalkers had high hopes, but as the years passed, even he couldn't find any escape, and the only thing he could do was make the boring time a little less boring.
At the same time, the reality of the plane East is about to usher in the fall of night, in the afterglow of the setting sun sprinkled throughout the Sensai College, the students finally ended the day's heavy schoolwork, accompanied by young and vibrant laughter, strolling in twos and threes on the college's avenue.
Yaya, a second-year student in the Department of Soul A, was one of them. She had a lovely pretty face, her long black hair was combed into two equally lovely ponytails, and she was wearing the standard uniform of Sensai College. After saying a simple goodbye to her classmates, she went to the college square alone, sat down on a bench at random, and then took out half a loaf of bread from her jacket pocket, which she had left over from dinner.
A few moments later, there was a sound of wings flapping in mid-air, and a few white doves quickly landed at Mia's feet, pecking at the crumbs she had spilled, cooing at the same time. Mia crouched down carefully, and her long ponytails swept gently along with her movements, and she quietly looked at the group and the pigeons she had become familiar with, with a smile of relief on her face.
The beautiful maiden, the docile white dove, the plaza with a few statues standing quietly, and the surrounding lush vegetation all come together in the last golden rays of the setting sun.
This is what Mia does every day, and it is the most relaxing time of her day. As an average student, life at Sensai College, an institution of higher learning, is always going to be extraordinarily hard.
"It's getting dark, that's all for today, and I have to go back to practice. Good-bye, gentlemen pigeons." With a relaxed smile on her face, Mia said goodbye to the group of pigeons, and hurried back to her dorm with her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under her short uniform skirt.
Evenings were also an important time to study, especially for a student of Mia's talent, which required less effort than the smile that seemed to hang on her face forever.
1. Chapter 1
The Su family mansion, a huge martial arts arena, is holding a martial arts awakening ceremony.
The young man on the altar, whose name was Su Yu, was the son of a great elder of the Su family, and he was very gifted.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed the nine-fold quenching body at the age of fourteen, known as the first day of the Su family.
Now there has been such a genius as Su Yu, so with Su Mo's talent, the awakened soul, is bound to be no worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo, can also awaken the human level of more than the fifth level of the soul, then the Su family this time, can appear two top talents, their future development of the Su family, is not small.
When the presiding elder called out the name, the shocked disciples, elders and others, all looked at the beautiful young man next to them, in the eyes, the sense of expectation, incomparably strong, even more than before Su Yu.
Sumo looked calm and lifted his feet to the altar.
Su Yu, walking down the altar, with a proud face, gave Su Mo a cold smile, and his eyes were full of provocation.
He took a deep breath and sat down on his knees, his eyes closed.
From the bottom of the altar, a stream of light immediately floated out, constantly drilling into Sumo's body.
His talent in the Su family is the top of the existence, only fifteen years old to complete the quenching body, talent can not be described as bad. However, he has always been Su Mo's head.
By this time, more and more runes were flashing on the altar, enveloping Sumo's body.
Sumo sat with his eyes closed, breathing slightly rapidly, and from his body, bursts of roaring sound gradually rang out.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar!
Boom!
Finally, there was a bang, a dark shadow rose abruptly, dark shadow like a black hole, which slowly rotated, bottomless, giving a sense of cold.
At the same time, a yellow halo flashed above the shadow.
Ah!
For a moment, all the people in the room, their eyes glazed over.
A halo?
The most low-level warrior soul?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu's face was glazed over with consternation.
Because, he did not think at all, the first day of the Su family, actually only awakened the human level of the first order of the soul, the most low-level soul!
Su Mopan sat on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, and he was stunned to see his own martial soul.
"A human-level warrior-soul..." Sumo muttered, a wry smile playing on his lips. He had never expected to awaken a warrior-soul of the lowest order!
The most garbage soul?Awakened a waste soul!
"What's the first day, it's basically the first waste in my Sue's house. "
For a moment, including Su's parents, deacons and others, everyone looked at Su Mo's eyes changed, there was disappointment, disdain, contempt.
At the altar, Sumo slowly got up, his fists clenched unconsciously.
After a cold glance around, Sumo sneered in his heart: "These people are really snobbish! "
In the past, Sumo was so gifted that everyone was polite to him, and everywhere he went, he was hugging and clapping his ass.
Now that he had awakened the Garbage Warrior, the men immediately changed their faces.
Sumo shook his head, didn't bother with them, and strode off from the altar.
There was some itching on the face, and what appeared to be a grassy area around it.
Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I come back to life?
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped death, his eyes widened with excitement at the sight.
No! How can such a beautiful girl be convenient anywhere?
Xu stared at the beautiful girl in front of his eyes completely faded the hem of the skirt, the sacrificial pants also took off bit by bit, into the eyes of a piece of tender white, but also with a woman's unique body fragrance.
"Girl, what are you doing? You can't defecate anywhere! "
She let out a shriek, dropped her skirt in panic, and the whole thing bounced off the ground, skimming across the air on a sword.
Shit, what is this? Royal sword flying in the sky?
So, what the fuck is a fairy?
At the same time, there was a sudden rush of strange but familiar memories in his head, as if he had been born to experience the general.
I fucking crossed!
Immediately read the file in the mind does not belong to their own memory, Xu lack to sort out everything.
This is actually a world of cultivating immortals, just like the little fairy in front of you who is so angry that her sword flies into the sky. People can cultivate all kinds of exercises to become immortals.
And the owner of this body is the present-day master of the horse, but this master of the horse is completely unlucky.
He himself is only a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was recruited by the emperor as a horse by chance, and he was provided with countless natural materials and treasures for his cultivation. In just six years, he congealed his belly and entered the Jindan period.
On the day he entered the Jindan period, he really entered the cave with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights in the marriage bed, and as a result, the beautiful princess, like a fox, cultivated him all over, and even the gift of spiritual root was taken away.
Genius Yu Maye just newly married to become a waste, has no use of the slightest value of his low-key sent out of the palace overnight, on the way to the border by the emperor's arrangement of people slapped to death, gassed to death, and finally abandoned here.
'Oh, it's a pity! '
Sorting out these memories, Xu lacks a look of regret on his face, shakes his head and sighs, chagrined: "Damn it! Why didn't you take a step earlier and cross over to the beautiful princess crazy in bed to do sports happy time? "
Thinking of the beautiful princess in the wedding bed of ecstasy, proud figure, and amorous gasp, Xu lack more and more feel a pity, a step too late ah!
"Bold adulterer, dare to spy on this girl in the toilet, give me my life! "
At that moment, there was a sudden rebuke, and it was the fairy who had gone and returned.
Her face was red with shame, but there was an endless sense of murder in her eyes, and she stepped on the cold mantle of the sword at the foot of the kill.
"Damn it, fairy, it's definitely a misunderstanding! It's clear that you squatted down where I was lying, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, would you please put your pants up first? You look like this, so I have no incentive to run away!"
The woman's face suddenly changed, and she blushed and mentioned the sacrilegious trousers under her skirt, and with a shriek, she angrily said, "The adulterer is looking for death." The speed of the sword's flight suddenly increased, and it swished toward Xu's death.
Running wildly, Xu lack frantically thought of a way to escape.
Suddenly, there was a flash of light in my head.
She immediately stopped, reached out and took a familiar token from her bosom, turned to the woman and yelled, "Bold witch, I am the horse of today's Fire Yuan Kingdom, do you dare to be disrespectful to me?
Just then, a series of system prompts rang out in Xu's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' for activating the face-punching system, this system will escort you and help you to fly! "
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' pretending to succeed, the reward pretending to be worth 1 point, whether to enter the mall to redeem? "
"The system detects that the host 'Xu lack' ability is low and weak, it is difficult to survive in the difficulty of this world, a special reward package for novices, whether to check the package? "
At the same time, a light curtain window popped up in front of the eyes, showing several pieces of information data.
Xu Xian first took a breath, followed by an uncontrollable laugh. What kind of face-punching system, a listen is tailor-made for me, to help me break the sky of the anti-sky system ah!
Adulterer, dying, what's so funny about you?
Suddenly, a petulant rebuke pulled Xu Xiao back from the ecstasy.
The woman was standing in front of him, holding a flying sword in her hand and pointing it at him, but her big eyes were wary and suspicious.
"Come on. . . you want to do something with me, don't you? Is there a way you can get closer to me and try?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' pretending to succeed, the reward pretending to be worth 1 point. "
Sure enough, the system beep that only he could hear sounded in Xu's ear again, and he couldn't help but laugh again. "Yes, there seems to be a gift bag. "
Suddenly, the picture in front of the light curtain window changed, there was a square gift box, the gift box was opened, a few streams of light jumped out, a flash.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' to obtain the first level of experience Dan, take can get 10,000 experience points. "
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Qiao' for obtaining two preliminary magic escape charms, which can be used to instantly move to any place outside a five-kilometer radius."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Xian' for obtaining the first level of the Five Elements of the Ancients (Note: The first level can only be cultivated until the foundation period, and then can be exchanged at the mall)."
"Ding, detected that the host 'Xu lacks' Linggen defects, do not meet the cultivation conditions, the system will complete all the Linggen for you."
Immediately, Xu lack of feeling in the body like a current through, the scalp momentarily numb.
Can be followed by a sense of comfort, all over the body pores like to be completely opened, greedy to absorb the four sides of Reiki.
Boom!
Soon, he felt his body change dramatically, becoming closer to nature, as if he could blend in and control everything.
But he was well aware of how familiar this feeling was, when the fire spirit root had not been taken away by the princess, he had such an affectionate feeling for the flame, and now the system not only restored his fire spirit root, but also completed the other attributes of the spirit root.
Golden wood, water, fire and earth, all at once five kinds of spiritual roots, and each is the most superior "heavenly" level.
I'm going to go, this is going against the heavens!
Thinking of this, Xu Xian finally could not help but raise his arms and shout: "The system in hand, the world I have, what bullshit fire Yuanguo Princess Emperor, when I return from Xu Xian upgrade, I will trample all of you underfoot, trample to pieces. "
"Bold adulterer, since he claims to be the fire of the country of the horse, he dares to speak out of his mouth, trying to kill the king? " The woman next to him was a little silly, this horse lost his mind crazy?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' pretending success, get the pretending value of 1 point. "
Xu lack of concentration, the corners of his mouth slightly twitched, damn, Gu dress forced to look forward to the future, almost forget the current trouble, have to quickly find a way to run.
'that's right, experience Dan! '
He suddenly remembered that there was a first-level experience Dan in the rookie package.
Without the slightest hesitation, hurriedly with the mind of the operating system interface, opened a package, three items appeared in it.
"Use, use. " Xu stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Xiao' on the success of the cultivation of the Five Elements of Taikoo."
"Ding, the host 'Xu lack' has taken the first-level experience dan and gained 10,000 experience points. "
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' upgrade, the current realm of gas refining period one layer. "
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' upgrade, the current realm of gas refining period three layers. "
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu lack' upgrade, the current realm of gas refining period ten floors. "
In just a few breaths, Xu went from a mortal without the power to bind chickens to a cultivator of immortals, sprinting directly to the tenth floor of the qi-refining period, just one step away from the foundation-building period.
And his strength now is infinitely stronger than the ten layers of the normal gas-refining period.
The reason is that he has five celestial roots, which is equivalent to a person having five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even with these five different auras, the power that erupts is much more than five times as simple.
"There's really nothing to say this time, I'm not invincible who is invincible? "
But at that moment, the woman opposite waved a streamer of light across the sky, and the sharp blade of the sword darted like a viper in the blink of an eye.
"Damn it, fairy, I just asked you, this little beauty, to come up and give Master Ben a good look, and who let you out of the sword? You're a sneak attack!"
When Xu saw the flying sword coming, he was startled and immediately opened his mouth to scold.
Can curse back, but the foot movement is not ambiguous at all, homeopathic slide back, fingertips actually condensed a wisp of water element aura, flick on the oncoming sword blade.
'when! '
There was a trill, and the sword flew out of him.
"How is this... possible?" He asked.
The woman immediately froze, Zongmen can be so dexterous to crack this sword, in addition to those who cultivate inscrutable uncles not to say, at least those who have to build the foundation of the sixth floor of the brothers and sisters can do it!
"I'm just wondering," he said, "what just happened was a misunderstanding, and you're still tangled up, and you're still trying to kill me? Don't think I won't hit you because you look like a fairy, but I just didn't see it clearly, and this time I'll look at it aboveboard."
Xu lack annoyed scold, the foot Yu step out, Tuyuan Reiki immediately into the earth, the speed suddenly doubled, in the blink of an eye appeared in front of the woman.
Immediately after, a wisp of water element aura gushed out of the palm, around the four sides, the woman did not have time to react, was imprisoned on the spot.
"Fornication... adulterer, what do you want to do?" The woman was startled, feeling that the fire element aura in her body was completely suppressed.
"Hey, now that you've called me a whore, I can't carry this pot for nothing."
With a smirk on his face and a raised eyebrow, he reached out and grabbed the hem of the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is a future life, dance with the king of the world!
Nine heavens, between the sea of clouds, wind and thunder, a line of heaven!
Here, is the nine heavens continent, three days, a Jedi, wind thunder platform! on the wind thunder, in and out of a line of heaven!
But at the moment, the wind and thunder platform, it is a misty mist!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Swords! You will not die! "
"Chuyang, the Nine Swords, the world's first artifact in your hands, is a pure waste, how many years, you have made no progress, is simply a violent aggressor of heavenly things!
Loud shouts came from all directions.
The look in his eyes, still as calm as a rock! - The body, still as straight as a javelin!
Like the sword in his hand, full of the meaning of not bending, even though he had been mortally wounded!
At his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, countless mutilated bodies, dripping with blood.
Looking around just shouting, but did not rush to a group of masters, Chu Yang face showed a bit of scornful smile, arrogance and disdain!
No matter how high such people and their xinxing are cultivated, no matter how many they are, even if they could kill me ten thousand times, they are not worthy to be my enemy!
How could the matter of the Ninth Harvest Sword in his own hands be leaked? He had clearly examined it for three years before he determined that there was a section of the Ninth Harvest Sword in the Fengleitai for the last three days, and it took him a lot of pains to finally find an opportunity to risk his life for the last three days, but why did he encounter such a powerful ambush after he came here?
Today, I entered the last three days, it is only the fifth day! Today's situation, pure death! I have always been known to be secretive, who knows their plans?
I rushed a dozen times in a row, each time, was blocked back! And their choice of these places, all belong to the dead corner!
Extremely in love, extremely in the sword! their own love into the sword, kendo into the martial arts, martial arts to seek the way of heaven, at the cost of lifelong loneliness, killing all over the world as a raft to save the world, but in the end, it is still not able to practice the nine swords, practice the nine heavenly gods gong!
Is it the wrong choice? Or is it the wrong path at all?
Merciless Swordsman Merciless Swordsman, if a swordsman has feelings, what is a swordsman? Kendo Budo Tendo, after all, is merciless... but at the moment of life and death, why is it so shaken?
Nine Swords Nine Swords, what is your secret?
Chu Yang smiled wryly as he looked around at the eyes staring greedily at the sword. You only know that you can be invincible if you get the sword, but do you know how much I paid for the sword?
There's nothing left.
Blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was passing quickly. He had pursued martial arts all his life, falling in love, breaking love, falling out of love until he was merciless, and at the moment of death, he thought that his only regret should be that he had not reached the highest realm of his life, but what he did not expect was that at this moment, there was a figure in his mind that he had long forgotten.
Mo light dance, Chuyang in love with a broken woman!
"Originally, I didn't really break love. . . " Chu Yang muttered with a self-deprecating smile on his lips.
A trace of remorse crept into his heart, like smoke, and swept over his whole mind in a moment.
Light dance! Unknown I go to Huangquan this time, may be with you?
"All of us together! Chop him up! As for the Nine Swords, let's discuss them before it's too late!" One man shouted, "If not, when he replies, it will be our turn to make a big deal out of it!"
"Life is not a light dance, a dance is a life of hardship; this life is a royal dance, a life of hardship dance!"
This is a love night, Mo light dance made a small poem. I remember, at that time, Mo light dance eyes with tears, eyes sad and bitter, she... knew that she was using her love to practice, but she still like a moth to the flame into their arms, let themselves burn!
Hearing the news, he immediately rushed to go, but in the end, it was a step too late. Although he would later hurt Mo light dance of all the family all killed even the nine families of chickens and dogs do not remain, but the beauty can not be reborn after all!
When he was dying, he lay softly in his arms and said to himself, "Chu Yang, if there is a future life... if I can still meet you, I hope you can take a good... look at me. I look better than a sword!"
Light dance, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can you have tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two clear tears, but their own heart, at that moment smashed to pieces! Since then, this heart dust!
Life and death follow each other to the ninth sky!
This is the world's first talent snow tears cold feeling Mo light dance to Chuyang's deep affection, specially made a poem.
And now, light dance, you have reached the ninth heaven, but I am still in the human world. . . but, I can immediately follow you in life and death. . . life and death!
Chu Yang thought in a trance, has always been cold and hard mouth, put on a gentle sad smile.
Light dance, wait for me!
You know, if I have a future life, I'd rather not practice kendo, I'd rather not peak, I'd rather not take revenge, and I'd rather be with you! What in the world can match your satisfied smile?
No, not bitter... light dance, you are bitter, but do not feel bitter, now... I am bitter!
Swords add more and more body, blood flying out, a little bit of pain from all over the body focus, and finally the mind of the song and dance interrupted!
Chu Yang roared with fury! He stood up suddenly, his long black hair flying violently!
Chu Yang's heart ached, looked down, hanging on the neck of the piece of jade pei snapped and shattered in front of his eyes.
This is the light dance to leave their only memorial ah!
"Kill! " Chu Yang suddenly looked up, the eyes of the killing machine mad rush, a wild drink, in the hands of the nine swords suddenly swing ten thousand swords, just like nine days of lightning suddenly connected into a girdle of light!
There was a bang, and all the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
Everyone hurried back, looking in horror at the foot of Chu Yang neat circle of half-cut weapons, cold sweat on the vest dripping down.
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Jiu Jiu sword? "
Before anyone could answer, he smiled grimly and said slowly, "Well, I'll show you the Nine Swords!"
He suddenly leaped! He had been mortally wounded so many times that he leaped!
"Nine marauding swords, a bit of cold light! "
With the arc shot out, thousands of cold mang rush out!
Nine Heavenly Swordsmanship! One Sword!
Nine heavens, is the name of this continent. Historically, all swordsmanship, never dared to use these three words to name, but this nine hijab swordsmanship, but directly is the use of the name "nine heavens"!
Throughout the ages, this is the only one!
Although Chu Yang could not play the real power of the Jiu Jiu swordsmanship, he had been aware of these swords for a long time. The power of these swords, although not as great as imagined, but also far beyond the worldly swordsmanship.
Surrounded by dozens of masters, knowing that this sword is not small, all took out the ability to press the bottom of the box, trying to resist this attack! Everyone's body is shaking, feeling the weapon in their hands, are about to hold unsteady.
"Nine marauding swords, what's the harm in slaughtering the world! "
The first move is not finished, the second move has been killing the advent of the rush of light, like the tide of the sea, boundless killing machine outburst!
Screams rang out, a dozen enough to dominate one side of the master, while trying to resist, but still covered in blood, retreated in confusion!
At this moment, everyone has a delusion: now Chu Yang, absolutely no injuries! Absolutely complete state!
They did not know that they had interrupted the memory of Chu Yang, interrupted the song and dance of Mo light dance, so that Chu Yang completely furious, completely out of all the potential of the body! This is the power of life, the rage of the soul!
"Nine marauding swords, a gathering of wind and clouds is the emperor!"
Chu Yang Huoran opened his eyes and bellowed, "Why? Why not?"
In the distance, three directions, three lights rise at the same time, in the air into three golden shadows!
He is only Wuzun, although the distance from the king level is only one level, but this level is no different from the difference between heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a great hand!
"But these last three days, it is not a place in your area where a poisoned sword Wuzun can sow wild! " One person said gently: "It is a pity that I can not fight you fairly, it is a pity! "
At the sound of the words, the other two appeared together. The three men, all of them with wide robes and long sleeves, flowing with the wind, came with a handsome posture and a calm face.
Chu Yang's eyes have been a little blurred: "You three kings . . . also want the sword of nine robbers? "
"But I want you to die!" The three smiled at the same time, with the same demeanor: "But by the way, to take over the Nine Swords is also a windfall.
Chu Yang smiled arrogantly, straightened his back, and said proudly, "It's a pity you don't know about the Nine Swords! You'll never get it!"
He is now powerless to fight again!
It was the only sword he could use to its full power, and when he saw it, he knew he could use it. But such a sword needed to be prodded with his own life!
It is the Nine Swords and Souls that kill and destroy all on their own!
The three kings were almost too late to fight, too late to scream, and they went up in smoke! Even the golden shadows of their royal power flashed in the air, but their lives had been reduced to nothing!
Chu Yang sighed, his body in mid-air, his eyes casually skimmed, but he found a figure that he thought should never be here. In the distance, a man in white stared at this side, his face full of disbelief.
"Heavenly machine? " Chu Yang eyes all the time, finally understand. Why their own so secret action was actually ambushed, why all their attacks have been accurately blocked!
It was him, and it was him. No wonder he was such a failure!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the sky, slowly fell down, like the dead leaves of late autumn, fell in the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, murmuring: "Dance, if there is a future life, dance with the king of the world! "
Since death is inevitable, then with the greatest enthusiasm and the most intense longing, embrace death, because there, have their own lovers!
CHAPTER II
Mengqi's secret joy was interrupted, and his complacency turned to shame, while Zhende and other small Sammy looked at the eyes of surprise and contempt, quite a primary school students to draw a line with bad classmates, only Zhenhui "Fang Aqi" stared blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, a trance-like appearance.
Subconsciously, Mengqi half-turned his head and looked at Xuanzang next to him.
For him, shame, depression is a small matter, exposing the fact that he borrows the body to return the soul is the big problem!
Xuanzang's face was still bitter and his eyes were dejected, and when he felt Mengqi's eyes, he shook his head slightly. "There is no Amitabha Buddha in the south, and everything depends on the decision of Xuanzang's brother," he said without hinting.
Well, he thought I saw that he was asking him for mercy. . . Munch quietly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that he had passed the test, unless the parents who abandoned the body, the horse-faced uncle and so on to find, it should not be seen through, if another ten years and eight years, it would be even more unsuspected, childhood memories would be easy to forget.
Compared to this, breaking into the servitude yard is just a small thing!
The crooked Mengqi tried to make his expression as dull as Zhenhui's, lest Xuanzang see that he was not so depressed and sad.
After the broad-faced and big-eared Xuangu questioned the remaining children one by one, together with Mengqi and Zhenhui, a total of six were admitted to the Miscellaneous Servants' Court, while the rest belonged to the Warrior Monastic Court.
The ruler of his right hand gently tapped his left palm: "Follow me to shave in the miscellaneous yard, receive monk robes and sutras and other things, and in the future, I will be hard-working, and I will not have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma schools to practice advanced sutras and martial arts."
There's a Dharma here, too?
Mengqi was stunned for a moment, but Xuangu didn't give him time to think, and walked straight through the children to the outside of the temple.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi did not dare to ask more questions, followed closely behind Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang two yellow-clad monks, turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You don't have to be formally initiated, you just have to worship the Buddha and shave your name." Xuan Ku pointed to the futon in the small Buddha hall.
"Yes, Uncle Xuangu," the children responded with Zhende, and one by one they knelt on the futon and prostrated themselves to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshipped the Buddha, Xuangu clasped his hands together, and Baoxiang solemnly saluted the statue, reciting "Nanwu Amitabha Buddha", then he went to one of the children and touched his right hand on the top of his head.
The child's long black hair changes instantly, with the speed of Munch's naked eye, the roots turn yellow, fall to the ground like leaves, and in less than two breaths, the child becomes a real little Sammy.
"The troubles are gone, the red dust is far away," Xuan Ku said solemnly, his mellow voice reverberating in the pure Buddhist hall.
What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!
Mengqi was surprised and excited. Will he have a chance to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuan Ku went to the children one by one and removed their hair, always saying the same words.
When it was Mengqi's turn, he bowed his head, meditated on the name of Buddha and Daozu, and mourned the hair that was about to say goodbye to him.
Thick and broad palms caressed the top of Mengqi's head, and a root of withered hair fell in front of his eyes, which made him sad, almost uncontrollable, but he loved the red dust, and never thought of becoming a monk.
"The troubles are over, the red dust is far away. "
The sound of Xuangu was like the sudden ringing of a bell, which made Mengqi tremble all over his body and clear his mind.
Can Xuan bitter left, clear disappeared, Mengqi's faith is still firm, the future must be vulgar!
After paying homage to the Buddha, shaving, and leaving a famous monk's plate, Xuan Kuo asked a few gray-clad monks to take the children to the backyard to get their own things - two sets of gray robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, the Shaolin Precepts, the Twelve Small Mantras for Morning Lessons, and so on.
"After you have learned the characters in the Teaching Academy, you will be able to recite the precepts of this temple and the small mantras of the morning class. Before that, I will first talk about the main precepts of this temple in general. First, you must not deceive your teachers and destroy your ancestors. Second, you must not allow or steal martial arts. Third, you must not kill living beings. Fourth, you must not drink alcohol. Fifth, you must not eat meat and sin. Sixth, you must not break the color precepts..." Xuan Ku repeated the main precepts that need to be observed several times.
He mentions only two of these punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and the rest of the punishments include coolie work, scripture copying, caning, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the "miscellaneous yard" with the little Sammy.
"In this temple, those who wear gray robes are the general monks, those who wear yellow robes are the deacons of the houses, and those who wear yellow robes and red robes are the abbots, the heads of the houses, and the elders..." Along the way, Xuan Kuo instilled "monastery common sense" in the young Shami without relenting, until Zhende and others entered the "warrior monastery" and he became silent again.
As the party walked further and further away, both inside and outside the yellow wall were shaded by green trees, and it was rare to see a Buddhist temple. After a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled and old courtyard.
"Oh, Master Xuangu, Master Xuanzang, have you come so early?" A fat monk at the door greeted him with a smile, wearing the same yellow coat, but with his collar slanted open and his stomach timid.
Xuan Ku frowned and meticulously said, "Nan no Amitabha Buddha, Xuan Xin brother, how can you be so lazy? "
The fat monk Xuanxin had long been familiar with Xuangu's temper, and he was not angry at all, saying, "Oh, you are too attached to the foreign minister, and this is for the disciples of our servitude institute?" He did not want to get involved with Xuangu on this issue, and pointed directly to Mengqi and other humane people.
"I'd also like to ask Brother Xuanxin to arrange it," Xuan replied solemnly.
At this point, Xuanzang, who had been making a saw-nosed gourd, suddenly opened his mouth: "Zhen Ying, Zhen Guan is still in the miscellaneous service yard? "
"It's still there, it's still there!" The fat monk Xuanxin said incredulously, "Brother Xuanzang, what are you asking them to do?
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed, "My martial arts have been destroyed, and it is inconvenient to mislead people's children. How dare I take students? Master Xuanxin, I'm tired of you letting them share a room with Zhenying and Zhenguan."
He was referring to Mengqi and Zhenhui.
Mengqi's heart beat violently, Xuanzang this is the first time to arrange their own affairs, should really Ying, Zhenguan two monks have something special, can help themselves?
"Haha, Master Xuanzang, how dare I bear a word of 'tiredness' for the things you ordered, Master? Why do you need to do such a small thing?"
Xuan Ku looked at Xuan Zang sideways and did not say much, but said to Meng Qi, Zhenhui and other small shami, "I placed you in the miscellaneous service academy because you each have problems. If you can solve your own problems and polish your xinxing, you may not have the opportunity to enter the martial arts monastery, the Dharma monastery, or even the Bodhi monastery in the future."
"But if you continue to cheat and be slippery, lazy and playful, impetuous and unbearable, I will not hide it, and will report it to the House of Discipline and punish you accordingly."
He did not hide his thoughts, in order to show frankness, not a bit of selfishness, said the next Xuanxin old blush.
"Yes, Uncle Xuanwu," Mengqi and other small Shami answered in unison.
After seeing Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin wriggled his body and let pieces of fat shake up and down: "Finally gone, I was most afraid to see this iron-faced ghost. "
The monk . . . Mengqi pretended not to squint, and followed Xuanxin, who was walking from side to side, into the meditation room.
"Zhen Ying, Zhen Guan, this is your teacher Zhen Ding, Zhen Hui." Xuan Xin pointed to Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, then turned and went to another meditation room with the other young shami.
In the meditation room, there is a bunk, enough for seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
On top of the bunk, two gray-clad monks were lying and sitting, both in their twenties. The one who was lying had a dull expression and was speechless, while the one who was sitting had a deep frown and a cold tone: "Package luggage and so on at the bottom of the bunk. If you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the courtyard and get it."
Mengqi took a look at the stolid Zhenhui, decided to open his own mouth to establish a good "roommate relationship. "
The man sitting said coldly: "True view. "
After the answer, he stopped speaking, and even turned his head not to look at Mengqi and Zhenhui, so that Mengqi's stomach to close the relationship of the topic can not play.
I closed my eyes and went back to sleep.
Who are these people?
Meng Qi secretly returned to the dark, but on the surface he smiled and said to Zhenhui: "Zhenhui Master, I am Zhending, in the future you can call Master on the line. "
"Yes, brother," Zhenhui exclaimed without any embarrassment.
It's still a good thing!
Mengqi sighed to himself, and decided to play the role of a brother and help Zhenhui: "Little brother, I'll call you little brother, come on, let's change the monk's robes first."
Although there were people in the room, Mengqi, who was often naked in his dorm room when he was in college, did not feel unwell, and quickly took off his clothes and changed into a monk's robe.
He was quietly grateful for the simplicity of the monk's robes, so that he did not make a fool of himself, while he examined the things on his body that he had not had time to examine before.
The body of the robe, fine weaver, soft texture, even if Mengqi did not know the goods, you can see the value of a lot of money, at the same time, "he" waist hanging a transparent jade pei, neck wearing a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red rope, close to the chest, cool, cool, uncomfortable.
Mengqi carefully played with the thumb-sized jade Buddha, only to see "it" full of compassion, lifelike, obviously extraordinary carving, at the same time, "it" feel delicate, both warm and give a sense of cool.
"According to Uncle Ma-face, what nameless old monk sent this jade Buddha? But since what kind of master did not take it, it is estimated that it is not an ordinary product, or better to wear it close to your body."
Mengqi re-hung the jade Buddha pendant on his chest, close to his body and hid it, and then packed up the jade pei, clothing, etc., and put it under the bunk he had chosen.
At this point, Zhen Ying, who had been sleeping, suddenly turned over and sat up, put on his shoes and went out. Meng Qi was stunned and did not understand what had happened.
"It's time for dinner," said Zhenguan coldly, and he got out of the bunk and went to the door.
What are these two people!
Mengqi scolded again, then turned to Zhenhui and said, "Little Master, are you all right? It's dinner time!"
As soon as Zhenhui's voice fell, the little figure darted to the door like a rabbit, as if it were already hungry.
"..." Munch was immediately embarrassed. Is he the only one who is more normal here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door and looked back at Mengqi, his face full of doubt: "Brother, won't you go? "
You have a little conscience and know how to wait for me!
Munch thought to himself, and then half-jokingly replied, "I'm not as hungry as you. "
Look at you two, it's like starving ghosts reincarnated! \Q>
He turned around and ran away.
Hey! He moved a few times and yelled, "Gi, little brother, wait for me! "
Suddenly, a wave of sadness hit his heart, others are small sister, why I only have a small sister, and there will be no sister in the foreseeable future.
As the rain poured down, a beautiful woman of twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a little boy of five or six, knelt before the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling, from a remote mountain village, six years ago she was admitted to college with dreams and hopes, but did not expect to meet a man who changed everything for her, this man is the famous flower of Beitang City... Li Zhe!
At that time! Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe in a school, an accident, she was taken by Li Zhe, and then Li Zhe launched a frantic pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost full of tricks, unscrupulous.
But Zhao Meiling is just a simple and simple girl who just came to the city, that would be such a love match, not only the body, but also the heart are completely given to him, but then Li Zhe tired of playing with her, he ruthlessly abandoned her.
Later, Zhao Meiling learned that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the child, for which she did not hesitate to fall out with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling wanted to raise him alone, but after five years, because the body is too tired, replaced by a terminal illness, there are no years to live, she finally decided to send the child to the Li family, want the child to feel a father's love, have a better life, then she can also rest assured after death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, completely did not recognize the child is their Li family, Zhao Meiling can only take the child kneeling in front of the iron gate, pleading.
At this point, the iron gate slowly opened, and several people came out with umbrellas, led by a man who bore a slight resemblance to the boy, who was the boy's father, Li Zhe.
"Here, smelly woman, this amount of money is enough for you to live well, " Li Zhe frowned, reached out and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe, you must keep Fu Er, he is your son!"
Li Zhe refused, and then said coldly, "Do you want the money or not? "
Hearing the words, Zhao Meiling had tears in her eyes and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn away.
Kneeling on the ground, Zhao Meiling hugged Li Zhe's thigh and begged, "Zhe! "
'snap! '
Before Zhao Meiling could finish, Li Zhe slapped her hard on the face, "Let go, you smelly woman."
When the little boy next to him saw his mother being beaten, he rushed over and hugged Li Zhe's thigh, full of childish exclamation, "Daddy, don't hit Mommy."
In fact, the little boy from birth, did not know who his father was, and the mother did not say again, until this time Zhao Meiling took out Li Zhe's photo to the little boy to see, the little boy knew that he had a father, and was so happy that he almost jumped up.
But now, he didn't understand why his father didn't want his mother, and hit her.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy holding his thigh, a look of disgust, and kicked the little boy out, "Who is your father, die ~ wild ~ seed! "
The little boy was kicked out and fell to the ground, curled up and covered his stomach with a face of pain that was more than a five-year-old boy could bear.
Zhao Meiling was also startled, hastily released Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, nervously and concernedly asked, "Fuer are you all right? "
The little boy looked at his mother worriedly, pursed his lips, fought back tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe did not look at the mother and son, into the iron gate, next to a man with gray hair like a housekeeper, picked up the check, handed it to Zhao Meiling, sympathetic advice, "You still accept it! "
Zhao Meiling shook her head, held the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain.
The butler looked at the back of the mother and son, sighed deeply, turned into the house, and slowly closed the iron door.
Four years later, before she died, Zhao Meiling called the little boy, who was nine years old and had grown up a lot, to her bedside, gently rubbed his head, smiled weakly and said, "Fu Er, you can study well in the future, you can have a good job in the future, and don't begrudge the Li family or your father.
The little boy fought back tears and nodded earnestly.
Looking at the little boy earnestly nodded to agree, Zhao Meiling put a serene smile on her face, and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, shining brightly on the earth, so that it was not dark around.
'Boom! '
Suddenly there was a deafening sound in the sky. Zhao Fu was startled and looked up at the sky. He saw that the whole sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of fire.
'Bang! '
With a loud bang, a meteor emitting colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu, the dazzling light let Zhao Fu block with his hand, and then the bright light dissipated, a one-finger-long, two-finger-thick crystal quietly floating in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu curiously stepped forward, holding the crystal, floating in mid-air crystal unresponsive by Zhao Fu a grasp.
At this time, the original sleeping people were also awakened by a series of loud noises, open the door or open the window, looking at the countless crystals floating in mid-air, began to frantically rush out of the house, looting the crystals, Zhao Fu did not stay in the same place, hurried back to his home.
In a single rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the crystal, if only by selling, this crystal is not a gemstone can be comparable, if the number is scarce, the value of the city is not at all, but the number of keys falling from the sky is too much, not to mention the appearance of tens of billions, so this crystal may not be worth much at all.
"Detect the host as a primary intelligence and begin soul binding..."
Ding! The soul binds successfully and begins its journey to the world of the apocalypse.
After the sound, Zhao Fu's eyes blackened and he fainted on the ground. "Hong Dali, male, 22-year-old orphan, died because he was brave enough to save two children who were about to be hit by a car.
"No, no, no, I don't want to go to the Hong family with you to make a betrothal!" Tang Muxin buried his head in the pillow, desperately kicking the white and tender calf: "Hong Dali is the city's famous waste ah, they have lost the face of the Hong family, and people are sick and crooked, the brain is not smart not to say or a standard septuagenarian, I don't want to find such a person as my fiance!"
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Ruisi, chairman of Tang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is versatile, Bo Gutong does not say now, looks like a flower, my fair lady, set the spirit of heaven and earth in one body, especially a good cook, the standard of the hall under the kitchen on the big bed, in the school I do not know how many boys dream lover.
Today, however, she heard her father say that he would take him to the famous loser Hong Dali family to be betrothed, so how could she bear it: "If not for his parents spoiled her, a single seedling in a thousand acres, on his kind of waste, would have been driven out of the Hong family to their own destruction, where would have the opportunity to lose the family all day long? "
Hearing his daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, who was sitting at the head of the bed, had a wry smile on his face and said helplessly, "Xinxin, I can't help it. "
Your relationship with Hong Dali, your grandfather personally decided that year, although he lost a little, but it is not a big problem, right?
Tang Ruisi was wearing a blue-gray waistcoat, a spotless white sweatshirt, a simple bow tie at the collar, a light stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, a short black hair combed back meticulously, polished, the whole image is quite good, but the original bright eyes are now full of helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of, if not really cornered, how would he be willing to send his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dali, can be called a wonderful flower in the world, the only thing he likes to do or will do, is two words: loser.
One of his most famous quotes was, "I have to be a loser. Don't losers waste my parents' talent for making money? "
This sentence can be called the whole city of Tianjing no one knows no one knows the joke, many parents educate their children will say: "If you dare to learn Hong Dali that septuagenarian, see that I do not break your legs! "
Therefore, Tang Muxin will have such a big reaction, it is indeed reasonable.
"It's the same..." Tang Ruisi frowned and thought, suddenly his eyes lit up, and said, "Xinxin, what do you think of this? Let's set up a relationship first, and when Dad's company is back to normal, then we'll find an excuse to withdraw the relationship. This time we're over budget for research, and once the funds keep up, as long as the project is successful, it will definitely be a sensational event in the world, and when we get over it, then we'll find a way to withdraw the relationship, and his family shouldn't say anything more, right?"
Tang Muxin whimpered, "It's easy to get married, but his family is one of the world's top 500 enterprises, which is so easy? "
I have to say, Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, she will not end well. This is the way of the world, the law of the jungle. When you are strong, no one may dare to touch you, but when you really fall, there will be no shortage of people.
For example, the old master of the willow family who had been pestering her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried again for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way but this method, and could only reluctantly get up: "Well, then try it first, sob, father, in the future you must remember to quit ah, I don't want to marry that black sheep! "
"Well, well, for the sake of my family Xinxin, my father will try to go around as much as possible." Tang Ruisi sighed and patted Tang Muxin on the shoulder: "Xinxin, go."
Hong Dali sat on the bed, his eyes blank, his mind in a mess.
The surroundings were strange, the memory in his head was quite wrong, and now he could only barely recall the screeching of the brakes, and the rest was a jumble of memories that did not belong to him at all.
Looking at his pale, slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself, "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live. So, where is this place?"
He looked around for a moment and thought, "It's urgent to find out what's going on. "
"One, whether I'm dead or alive now. Two, where is this place, who am I? Three, what should I do next?"
"Now let's look at the first point," Hong vigorously pinched a small piece of oily skin on the back of his left hand and rubbed it. "It hurts, so I should be alive," he said, carefully touching his face, neck, ears, and top of his head. "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the realm of human beings."
"Then the second question is, where is this place, and who am I?" Hong Dali looked around again, at the reinforced concrete structure of the house, the snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a thirty-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room: "It's modern society, yes, but I've never seen the stars on the walls around me, and I've never heard of all kinds of toy models.
With no one around, Hong stood up carefully and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak, like a thin bamboo pole, I really don't know when it will suddenly die ah. "
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali opened a few Web sites at random, and the content displayed was very different from that on Earth, but at least he understood a few things: "First, the writing of this world or this country is still Chinese characters. Second, it is indeed a parallel space, and many things are different from Earth, but not too much.
No ID card?Thinking about it, but quickly relieved: "Oh, look at the age of this body should not be very high, about 17 or 18 years old, the ID card may be done, but it is more likely that it has not been issued, after all, this world is different from the earth, some nuances are normal."
"Big loser system binding success, current level: level one."
System tone introduced here, Hong Dali suddenly appeared in the mind of a small person, it seems that it should be himself.
"Host name: Hong Dali."
Sexual ability: 32. Note: Normal people have an index of 100."
Hong Dali looked flabbergasted: "The big loser system? Is this thing true or false?
Fortunately, there is no way out, Hong Dali is eager to commit suicide kung fu, the system's metal voice again came: "Note: the host every loser 100,000 yuan (RMB), you can get an attribute point.
When all the host's attributes reach the level of normal people, the big loser system will be upgraded, there will be new items to add, please look forward to.
"Can you get attribute points?" At this point, there is really nothing better than being able to improve their attributes, Hong Dali listened to the eyebrow smile, "Can you really get attribute points through the loser, let yourself become like a normal person?"
Although the sound of the system is still so cold, it is almost like a song in the ear at this time: "Yes. "
Hong Dali excited almost did not jump up: "I want to splurge! I want to lose! "
"Then ask the host to take the first task: the first loser. The task requirements: lose at least 100,000 yuan before midnight today.
"Current loser amount: 0."
"Damn it, it's eight o'clock in the evening! There's only four hours left, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose!"
Just thinking about it, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali and said softly, "Master Dali, Master and Lady let you pass, please follow me."
"Will you buy me a game pod?" Jiang Fei asked his father expectantly.
"Little Fei, you're in high school now, and you can't indulge in games like you used to!"
"Mom, this game is different! This is a 13-year-old masterpiece crafted by Saatchi & Saatchi, known as the second world of mankind!"
Jiang Fei said that the game called "Dawn" is indeed another innovation in human history, it is not only a model of virtual reality games, the degree of realism is close to 100 percent, but also through a new technology, can allow players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through this technology, the human body physiologically enjoy eight hours of quality sleep, but mentally can experience twenty-four hours of completely different magical life!
"This game is promoted by the whole country! It's not deceitful, this game not only doesn't affect learning, but also allows people to have a better rest!"
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
"I said for the last time, no, if you don't go back to your room and do your homework in twenty seconds, your allowance for the next month will be cut by fifty percent!"
'Old stubborn! '
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that there was no need to talk about it, his family conditions are good, his father is definitely not reluctant to buy this game pod, but his father's brain is rigid, absolutely do not believe that playing games will not affect learning! "Flying brother, how about it? Tonight "Dawn" will be officially opened, are you ready for the game pod? "
As soon as the bell rang and the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei picked at his shoulder and asked.
Don't mention it, I can't play with you this time!Jiang Fei gave a wry smile!
The brothers are all pointing at you!
Little fat man Zhao Feng said quickly, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in school, Jiang Fei's high school class 19 is the key class of the school, but Jiang Fei's grades belong to the middle, grades are not up or down, sports are not good, and not very good at interpersonal communication, so it can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree, so what can I do?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, and he had nothing to say to his only friend.
"Would you like the brothers to pool their money to buy one for you?" said Zhao Feng, because Jiang Fei's condition is similar, are the kind of guy who is not outstanding in all aspects, so the relationship between the two transparent people who do not receive the attention of teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
'i hope so! '
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei from childhood likes to play games, especially this kind of realistic games, as a boy, that do not want to fight swordsman? Husband when with a three-foot sword, immortal achievements, this is the dream of every boy, but peacetime, but also a highly developed society of science and technology, not to say that there is no war, even if there is a war, but also press the button, so want to enjoy the blood of the battle can only go to the virtual game experience!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless, since the promotion to high school, Jiang Fei was ordered by his father to limit entertainment, all the game equipment at home sealed, online games are exempt!
After school, Jiang Fei lethargically walked home, although it was only about six o'clock in the evening, but because it was already winter, so it was dark very early.
Thinking that today is the "Dawn" opening day, Jiang Fei gamely locked himself in his room! About ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework, he lay on his back on his bed, looking at the wall clock a little closer to the ten o'clock position, some of the heart is not a taste.
The opening time of Dawn is ten o'clock this evening, and then every day from ten o'clock to six o'clock the next morning, running eight hours a day, without delaying the player's normal life, but also allowing the player to fully experience twenty-four hours of game time!
Jiang Fei muttered as he subconsciously rubbed the ring on his index finger.
What the hell is this?
Jiang Fei's mouth open boss, looking at the hand of this faint shimmering ring, scared some speechless!
'buzz! '
A flash of white light, Jiang Fei in front of a flower, and when the line of sight is clear again, in front of him is not his own room!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of Dawn! Rookie Assistant No. 34784 is at your service!"
A clear female voice came into Jiang Fei's ears!
"Dawn? This is the landing screen for Dawn? "
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface!" replied the new assistant.
Jiang Fei is still a bit difficult to imagine, he does not have a game cabin, how can he enter the game?
Maybe this is my dream! Maybe I was too tired to finish my homework, so I lay down in bed and fell asleep, including the mysterious ring just now. I'm afraid it's all part of the dream, day thinking, night dreaming, maybe I want to play this game too much! Chapter 1
Liar! Great liar!
An angry Jiao drink, followed by the sound of the soles of the feet on the bluestone ground to escape.
Zhang held out his hands helplessly: "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher at the college... I just want you to be my student! Besides, even if I'm a liar, why add the word 'big'?"
After muttering, remembering what the director of political education had said, he rubbed his brows: "Seventeenth! If I can't get a single student today, I can roll up my bedding and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Hangben is not a person of this world, but the administrator of an ordinary university library on Earth, only remembers the fire, and then... there is no then, woke up to this world again.
As described in the novel, martial arts is respected, strength is king!
I thought I would be able to cross a waste firewood, was tragically remarried, and then hit the face counterattack, singing all the way. . . I seem to have thought a lot, and when I got here, I found that it was not a student, but . . . a teacher!
One of the saddest teachers in the whole college!
Other people's classrooms, are overcrowded, crowded can not sit down, and his classroom, no one, he managed to pull in a few, and finally even scolded several "liar" , turned and fled!
Investigate the reason, by their own soul pierced guy, teachers in the strength of the lowest do not say, but also very poor vision, can not see anything, the key . . . also taught wrong, out of a case of fire into the devil!
This is the same as the dead people in the hospital, whose reputation is greatly damaged and despised, and even the new students stay away one by one for fear of falling into his hands and being taught half-dead!
There were no students, and it was criticized. Last year's teacher evaluation, the whole college came last, and even got the only zero score in history.
Under the depression, drink to worry, as a result of the wish to hang up, he took the opportunity to cross over.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum that if he could not enroll another student in his class this year, he would be expelled from teaching!
Today, seventeen new students passed by his classroom, and as a result, as soon as they heard his name, they all ran away without exception, like a little girl who ran away as fast as she could when she encountered a strange corn.
"Looks like we have to find a way to fool one! "
I was thinking about how I should open my mouth to pull people, and I saw a girl with a dull face showing her head from the door.
Excuse me, is this Mr. Lu Xun's classroom?
The voice is sweet, lovely, beautiful, lovely.
Mr. Lu Xun, the star teacher of the college, the classroom is full every time, countless people come to admire.
"That's her!" Seeing someone throw himself into the net, his eyes lit up.
Recall all kinds of forced routines you have seen in previous lives, sit quietly in your seat, and assume the posture of a worldly superior: "Do you want to worship him as a teacher? "
The girl sparrow-like nod, black eyes, full of adoration: "I heard that Mr. Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian College, the professor's students, all extraordinary strength, everyone is proud to join his class! "
"No matter how well he talks, if he doesn't agree with your cultivation theory, not only will he not make progress, but if he doesn't get it right, he will fall back! If the teacher's reputation is not obvious, if he agrees with your theory, he can make rapid progress and greatly increase his cultivation!"
The girl was stunned for a moment, her beautiful eyes a little confused: "But I don't know what kind of class I'm suitable for!
Seeing her take the bait, she opened her eyes and hesitated for a moment. Marx, Encos and other sages came to mind one after another, pretending to be in a quandary: "Meeting is predestined, so I am also a teacher in this college, and I can help you look at your roots, talents, and temperament for free, and recommend a suitable teacher for you by the way!"
I did not expect to meet the teacher casually, so righteous, the girl excited hastily nodded.
"You show me your cultivation first! "
His eyes were half open and half closed, and he didn't seem to care.
'yes! '
Whoosh whoosh!
A moment of kung fu, the wind in the room roaring, a dragon-like movement of energy in the girl's body, the whole human breath, condensed but not scattered, powerful but not obvious, on behalf of her has an excellent foundation.
"Well, I can see that you usually cultivate earnestly and assiduously, have a solid foundation, and have excellent talent. You are a rare genius!" After a set of punches, Zhang nodded with satisfaction.
He learned this from the fortune-tellers on Earth, and the words are golden, wide-ranging, so that people do not hear mistakes, but secretly accurate.
"Teacher, I was injured in the leg, the doctor said, basically the same as useless. . . " The girl interrupted his rant, some doubt in her eyes.
"Injured..." Zhang Hanglao blushed, but he was too thick-skinned for others to see, and continued to talk nonsense: "Do you think I didn't see it? Just now when you exerted your strength, I knew it!
Anyway, it's all fooling around, you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense, fooling around with a disciple first.
"Chance? Teacher, what kind of chance is it?" The girl's eyes lit up.
After her leg injury, she has always felt inferior to others, secretly inferior, did not think that there may be a blessing in disguise.
"This opportunity, can let you soar into the sky, become the first freshman is not too much, after all, your talent is very good, is a unique genius, but..." Zhang Hanghaikou even, almost did not take out a "Tathagata Palm" .
Hearing that she could be the first freshman, and boasting that she was a genius, the girl couldn't help but show heat on her face and hurriedly asked, "But what? "
"But..." Zhang sighed, a pair of good talent is about to be buried exclamation: "There are not many teachers in the whole college who can see this kind of opportunity!
"No students? " The girl, who had high hopes, heard this with a slightly dimmed look in her eyes, and then thought of something and jumped up: "They don't accept students, so the teacher you... do not accept? "
"Of course I still take it, but, as you can see, I don't care about fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!"
Poof!
Before she had finished speaking, the girl prostrated herself to the ground: "I know that Mr. Gao is noble, but please accept me as a student! I will cultivate well and not lose Teacher's face!"
"Students promise not to disturb the teacher as a last resort!" Seeing his reluctance, the girl nodded quickly, with a sincere face.
"I don't have many students, may not be as resourceful as other teachers, and will be criticized. . . " Zhang continued.
"So. . . I heard that refining resources is very important. . . " The girl hesitated.
The resources that teachers receive at the college are tied to the performance and number of students they teach, and if the resources are not enough, it will be difficult to make progress in cultivation.
"Cough, I said this on purpose to test you, and since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I will take you under my wing!" Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Hang immediately interrupted and hurriedly said, "Identification!
'it's... so fast? '
I didn't expect the teacher's face to change like a book, fast outrageous, the girl slightly staggered, took the token that Zhang handed over on behalf of the identity, is considering whether to verify, before seeing the composure of Zhang teacher, has pulled her palm, took out a sharp knife gently stroke, a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Buzz!
The light flickered.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't the teacher just say to think about it, indifferent to fame and fortune, how to move so fast, and... the knives are ready?
"From now on, you are my student!"Dripping blood to confess the Lord, Zhang Hang was relieved and regained his superior appearance again: "What's your name?"
"Back to the teacher, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it could not be changed, the girl said no more, a face budding nod.
"Well, take your ID badge, get your bedding and books, and find your own place by the way. Classes start tomorrow, so come here and find me!"
Zhang swings his hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded and turned to leave.
"Successful fooling around on the last one!
Seeing her become her own student, Zhang Hang breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.
It's not easy, if not the network has seen a lot of pretending skills, I'm afraid it's really difficult to succeed today.
With a student, he was able to avoid the bad luck of being expelled. Zhang was relaxed, and immediately felt that the whole person's spirit was a lot smoother in an instant, and the attachments that hovered in his mind about his predecessor were slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since crossing into you, will live well for you! "
Before that, Zhang Hang died because he couldn't recruit students, and there was a lot of reluctance. At this moment, there are students, and the last insistence has disappeared without a trace. Until this moment, Zhang Hang is a complete master of this body.
Boom!
Completely in control of the body, Zhang Hang was thinking of fooling a few more students next, he felt a shock in his mind, a yellow bell Dalu's voice rang out.
Boom!
All kinds of mysterious language, he was a little dizzy, and then there was a huge palace in his mind, with five big words shining on it.
Tiandao Library!
Push the door to enter, countless bookshelves, all kinds of books endless, at a glance can not see the end.
"Library? Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, and I won't be in this world.
Other people's package, not the old grandfather, is the system, all kinds of good things, but he is a library, Zhang Hang only felt a black in front of his eyes, almost did not faint.
A library? A dry bird? Is there going to be a fight where someone throws a sword and I throw a book?
See what books they are?
Feeling helpless, Zhang reached out to the books on the shelves and grabbed them, trying to see what the library was all about, but found that the palm of his hand went straight through the shelves and grabbed an empty one.
"You're playing with me? Give me a library, but I can't get any books, I can't read them, what the hell are you going to do?"
Zhang hung his face speechless and wanted to cry without tears.
Part 1, Chapter 1
Hey, where's my tattoo?
Zhao Yu lifted his sleeve and looked at his two white arms in amazement. Before, his arms were tattooed with two teeth and claws, domineering green dragons!
What... it's all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found herself sitting in a dazzlingly lit office, with small partitions in front and behind her.
At the moment, the phone kept ringing, paper documents were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were speeding through the hall, all looking anxious.
At this point, a middle-aged man wearing a brown jacket came quickly and greeted the crowd, "Qu Ping group leader will now tell you about the case of electric baton rape, tonight to start the operation, everyone pay attention to listen!"
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was full of writing and a few photos.
Hearing the greeting, a large number of staff hurried around, casually pull up a chair, sit in front of the whiteboard and listen carefully.
Zhao Yu did not move the place, still sitting in his seat.
Now, still in great shock, he touched his right ear, which was intact!Before, his right ear had been split in two by a punk in a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw the photo on the desk. There was a handsome young man in a police uniform, who looked exactly like himself!
Grandma is a bear! Startled, a stream of strange memories like the Yellow River flooding general, instantaneously into his mind.Zhao Yu gradually realized, did... he encountered the legendary - crossing!
Zhao Yu clearly remembers that he was the gold medal fighter of the Qinglong Gang, a ruffian king who fought to the death! Although his real name is also called Zhao Yu, but the people in the rivers and lakes prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma is a bear!
Zhao Yu was startled again, and he finally remembered that before this, he had been executed by drug injection!
But, read read read... how did you get here?
Could it be that... I really crossed!?
And it's seamless docking, there's no use for reincarnation?
As new memories flooded in, he was surprised to find that it was a parallel world, and his current identity, as an agent of the mobile unit of the Major Crimes Unit, was actually a policeman!
This hall where he is now, not elsewhere, is the office of the police department!
Zhao Yu could not believe his eyes, such a huge contrast is really unimaginable. A senior ruffian turned into a major crime squad agent, this... where is the reason?
He touched his head subconsciously. Before, he had been cut several times on the head, and his hair was always uneven, so he simply had a big shaved head, as if he were evil. But now he had flowing black hair, and he was completely handsome.
"Colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of rape with electric batons in our city..." At this moment, a short-haired, wide-eyed female detective is telling the case for the people.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information from the memory of this agent, she is the leader of the B group of the serious crime team, regardless of her age, but steady style, high crime solving rate, is the leader in front of the red. Generally what needs the cooperation of the whole team of major cases, will be presided over by her.
"The victims were all well-dressed young women, and they all had bad lifestyle problems," said Qu Ping, the group leader. "Most of the incidents took place near bars, cabarets and other weathered places, and the time of the crime was after midnight."
"According to the victim's confession, the perpetrator first followed the victim into a deserted alleyway, then stunned her with an electric baton, and then raped her. After the crime, the perpetrator also urinated on the victim!"
Hearing the word "pee * pee" , the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu took a look, and this person is Liu Changhu, the vice-captain of the mobile team of the Serious Crimes Unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person has no less than a branch of Zhao Yu, and every day let him send a letter and pour tea, just like the next person.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a ruffian king, but a big boy with a weak character, who has just finished his internship and become a regular police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many of his senior colleagues will make fun of him and assign him some jobs that should not belong to him.
Now Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon, how can he stand to be yelled at? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled Liu Changhu, and even Qu Ping, the leader of the group, had to pause.
Who knows, just as everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly grabbed Zhao Yu's head. A ponytailed, slightly fat body, but also wearing large glasses of a girl, appeared in front of everyone.
The girl is a newly assigned trainee clerk of the Major Crimes Unit, named Li Beni. This girl is a fool, only contact less than a month, she fell in love with Zhao Yu.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied, she is a talented person, with a height of 78 meters, Yushu Linfeng, young and handsome, and really has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being shouted at, Li Beni hurried forward to relieve the siege: "Captain Liu, I'll come, I'll come! I'm still in the internship period, so naturally I'll do these jobs!"
With that, Li Beni smiled at Zhao Yu and ran to the pantry in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu did not have a good attack, so he had to sit down again patiently and continue to think about his crossing. Although he crossed, his memory is very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was lying on the execution couch. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he had been framed and had not killed anyone at all! The person who had been killed was the boss of a real estate group, and Zhao Yu had only beaten him in accordance with the instructions of his superiors.
Besides, even if he had been beaten to death, it would have been manslaughter, and he should not have been convicted of murder!
Thinking of all this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be full of anger and clench his fists. If he could find the people who framed him in the future, he would make them pay back double!
By this time, Li Beni had already brewed the coffee and distributed a cup to each of the colleagues present. The little girl's face had been brimming with enthusiasm, and every time she gave out a cup, she would kindly encourage a "hard work" and "come on" and so on, which won the favor of her colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, there are two packets of sugar in this cup! Tonight is doomed to get through, you have to stick to it!"
Without waiting for a response from Zhao Yu, Li Beni placed the plate happily.
At this point, the head of the Qu Ping team had finished speaking about the case, and it was up to Captain Jin Zhenbang, the head of the Serious Crimes Team, to speak. Captain Jin was over 50 years old, gray at the temples, and he was an unsmiling, very serious man.
Captain Jin said loudly, "There have been three electric baton cases, and one more will be classified as a serial incident.Not only the top, we can't wear this big hat!
So, we all take heart and try to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "So... Group A sent someone to the crime scene to investigate, since the perpetrator was following the victim, then he must have appeared in the bar and cabaret where the victim was before, and all the surveillance there must be transferred out, and this person must be found!
'yes! '
"Team B, you are mainly responsible for the matching of evidence!" Captain Jin ordered, "The criminal has no case record, and the line of blood does not go through. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue, although the police can not find a match, but you can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check and match, as long as the person has had a medical examination or has been hospitalized, you will be able to find him!"
'yes! '
"In addition, the electric baton used by the perpetrator, the mobile phone signal at the scene, the only victim who has seen the face of the perpetrator, these clues can not be ignored, all should be sent to follow up!"
'yes! '
"Well, let's arrange a plan of action for each group, and if there's no problem, let's go as soon as possible," Captain Kim said, closing his folder and turning to leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!" He yelled.
When they looked back, they found that the speaker was no one else, it was Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also stunned and hurriedly asked, "What's the matter, Zhao Yu? What's your problem?"
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said, "I'm not comfortable, go home first, you play with yourselves! "
Part 1, Chapter 1
21st century, Donghai City Senior Private Hospital Director's Office.
"Snap", a thick case was slammed on the table, President Lin's face was livid, angry, "Han Yunshio, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group, he owns 40 (percentage) of the equity of our hospital, you must give him priority to arrange detoxification!"
In the face of the president's fierce anger, Han Yunshio put his hands in the pockets of his white coat, very calm. "President Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li is a chronic snake venom, non-emergency I am not allowed to jump the queue here."
She is pure and beautiful, a pair of large eyes, a pair of small pear vortex, at a young age with amazing acupuncture talent known in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, is a rare master of detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or toxins in the human body, is her strength.
"You know, this is Lingyun!" The dean shot up in anger.
"That's enough, don't tell me that all doctors are equal, only men and women. Han Yunshio, I tell you, arrange for detoxification immediately, or get out of the medical profession from today!"
I thought Han Yunshio would be afraid, but she was still calm and serious, "President Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, there are only two kinds of people, I want to save and I do not want to save, Mr. Li I do not save, please ask another smart! "
With that, she smiled politely and turned to go. Her seemingly emaciated body was graceful and calm, and there was a kind of pride in her quiet beauty that could not be ignored. However, when Xuan Han Yunshio opened the door, President Lin was furious.
"Han Yunshio, don't you dare talk to me like that, you stop me!"
As she said this, she threw the case clip on the table at the back of her head, and Han Yunshio was stunned, only to feel a sense of wet heat slowly running down the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Tianning.
Han Yunshio woke up in a daze from the sedan chair, and heard a festive scene around him, blowing Suo banging gongs and drums one after another, and his eyes were dark.
What's going on?
Han Yunshio pulled off the thing that covered his head and looked at it, and suddenly he took a breath of cool air. Isn't this Hippa? Subconsciously, he looked up and down, and found himself dressed in a phoenix crown, like a bride who is getting married... drunk!
The sedan chair tossed and turned, so that Han Yunshio had a headache, and at this time, strange memories also flooded into the mind. There was no doubt that she had crossed, and as soon as she crossed, she was going to marry!
The original owner was the daughter of the Han family of the Tianning medical family, also known as Han Yunshio, because her mother's medical skills saved the life of the then empress, which is now the empress dowager, was fingered for marriage to the then seven emperors, which is now the king of Qin Longfei night, at that time was also spread as a good story, the Han family also soared in status.
But no one knows that Han Yunshio’s mother died as soon as she was born, and she grew up to be an ugly woman who did not know medical skills, so the marriage became taboo for the King of Qin to delay again and again. Some days ago, the King of Qin annoyed the Emperor, and the Emperor ordered her to marry on a date before the end of the month.
Qin Wang Long non-night youth crowned king, is the only remaining imperial son in the struggle for the throne, young only in his early twenties, but is now the only imperial uncle, can be said to be the first person of high power in Tianning.
Qin Wangfu in the south of the city, Han family in the north of the city, the sedan chair had to pass through the city from north to south, Qin Wang married, even if I did not show up, but according to the thousands of empty alleys, the whole city sensation.
As Han Yunshio was sorting out these memories, the joy came to an abrupt end, only to hear Xiba exclaim, "It's not good, it's not good! "
The first chapter
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's going to be zero o'clock soon. Get up and eat some dumplings."
He opened his eyes and saw a young face that existed only in his memory.
Sister?
"Wake up, go wash your face quickly, tell you not to drink, you have to drink, and fall asleep without looking at the Spring Festival Gala," Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is it New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu looked around confusedly, a small room of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched bedding, an old wooden table, a twenty-watt incandescent lamp overhead, emitting a yellow glow, the wall is still pasted with old newspapers, on which are some of the national events he can not remember.
Isn't this the old house on the family farm when he was a child, but it has long been torn down with the construction of small towns, and how did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, and then realized that it was definitely not a joke, because his hand became smaller and his arm became thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood by the doorframe, which still had the mark he made with a knife every New Year's Day, the highest line, 1988, 166 centimetres.
It's 1988? He hasn't graduated from junior high school yet?
He pinched himself so hard that he almost cried out in pain. Was it not a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out. His mother was cooking dumplings in a cauldron in the kitchen. He lived in a small house, and on the other side of the kitchen was the living room.
"Get up, will you still drink?" Zhang Muhua looked at his son with pity.
Feng Yu looked at her mother, who was still full of black hair, and her eyes were moist.
"Mom, you've worked hard.
"This child, what do you say, wash your face quickly, go to the house to watch TV for a while, the dumplings will be ready in a minute." Zhang Muhua heard that hard, the heart is also very happy, his son is growing up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. In the future, when he was just able to make money, his father was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and died in less than three months, without even spending a penny of what he had earned.
For a long time, Feng Yu's heart was hard.
"Dad." Feng Xingtai turned his head and looked at his son: "Get up, are you still dizzy? Watch the TV, the national dance party, can be festive."
"Dad, I'd like to have a drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Beer will do."
He had never had a drink with his father in his life, and Feng Yu now had a strong desire to drink with his father again.
"I don't have a long memory, that's all right, I'll drink a little later, I think you can get up tomorrow to pay New Year's greetings No, Danying, go get two bottles of beer."
Feng Danying shook his head helplessly and turned to get the beer and glass.
There was also a single bed with a futon on it. Feng Danying went to school and lived in the room with her mother when she came back from vacation. Feng Xingtai slept on this bed, but three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping on it.
On the west wall of the living room was a three-door standing wardrobe with two suitcases on top of it, and on top of a solid wood table was a fourteen-inch black-and-white television, which was showing the Spring Festival Gala.
There was a round folding table in the middle of the living room. It was already full of dishes and chopsticks. There were eight dishes in all, but they were all leftovers from the evening. There was chicken and fish and elbows. All eight dishes were meat dishes, and none of them were vegetarian.
Instead of watching TV, Feng Yu went to the front of the wardrobe and took a closer look at the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall in the doorway. February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can be sure now that he is born again!
The mother quickly cooked the dumplings, Feng Yu and Feng Danying went to the kitchen to help bring the dumplings up, all four sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up the chopsticks.
"Xiao Yu, you still drink!" Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, for the New Year, just let me drink a little more."
Feng Xingtai also helped to say a few words, Zhang Muhua shook his head, let them go. Feng Yu also gallantly to his mother and sister also poured a glass of beer, the family, must drink a glass.
"Dad, Mom, Sister, Happy New Year, Cheers!"
These leftovers on the table, Feng Yu casually ate a mouthful, all feel particularly delicious. This year, there are no future generations of those hormone additives or anything. Fish, rabbits and everything are wild, chickens and pigs are home-raised. The two of them ate these dishes, on the dumplings, one of them drank a bottle of beer, no matter how much Feng Xingtai would not allow.
After eating, Feng Yu washed up and went back to his hut to lie down. As he lay in bed, he tossed and turned and couldn't help but think of his life before he was born again.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his 40s. After resigning from a securities company, he made his own investment life.
With a wife and no children, his father died at an early age, and his mother lived with him.
He remembers that it was the spring of 2015, and he wanted to make more money in order to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, so he mortgaged all his family's savings, including his house and car, borrowed a lot of money, and put it all into the stock market.
At first, the situation was very good, his investment, soon doubled, so he boldly used a high leverage in an investment company, want to make more profit, another doubling, he did nothing for the rest of his life, can also be food and clothing.
When the stock market rose to 5000, he, like many people, was greedy and thought that it could continue to rise. At first, the stock market did rise some more, but it soon took a dive, because he used high leverage and did not have any additional funds, but lost a lot of money. After paying back the borrowed money, he became destitute, his wife did not know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he did not know how to go home to his family.
He was broke, he had a lot to drink that day, and then deliberately, under the watchful eye of a lot of people, he accidentally fell on the road and was hit by a big truck.
It wouldn't be considered suicide. He'd taken out an accident insurance policy that would have paid out millions, enough to get his house and car back and leave his mother and wife some money.
He remembers that he was looking at the speeding truck, thinking that if God could give him a chance to start again, he would not die in such a way, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But I didn't expect God to really give him a chance to start again!
Now that God has let him come back, there will be no regrets in this life. He is going to be a millionaire, he is going to be a legend in the investment world!
"Xiaoyu, don't shout, go to sleep."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted, complaining at the same time about her husband, how he let his son drink at night, which is nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. Chapter 1
Monday, May 20, 2019.
Spring ends at the summer solstice.
This season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan area has become very large. During the day, people still wear pants and become hot dogs; at night, they have to huddle under the covers and become cold birds.
Jiangnan University Town.
Song Shuhang was alone in the dormitory, and the computer desk was pulled to the side of the bed so that he could watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang did not have a penchant for skipping class - it was sweltering in the middle of the night last night, and in his sleep he made a move to 'ssangyong out to sea' and kicked off the quilt.
In the middle of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who had only a pair of shorts on his body, was forced to sleep. His hands groped for the bed, but he could not feel the quilt. Finally, he shrank into the shape of a prawn, shivering under the midnight wind.
As the sun rises, Song Shuhang has become a member of the seasonal cold army.
His roommate has excused him from today's class.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The fever faded, and he was still a little weak, so he couldn't go to class at all, so he had to stay alone in his dorm room and watch movies.
On the screen, the progress bar of the film slowly advanced, but the content of the film, Song Shuhang did not look into it at all.
He yawned, and his eyelids felt heavy.
At this point, the chat software in the bottom right corner of the computer jumps.
This is a prompt for someone to add him as a friend or join a group.
"Who added me?" muttered Song Shuhang, who reached out and tapped the bottom right corner of the computer's touchscreen, prompting a message to pop up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (******) has asked to add you as a friend.]Additional message: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who is this strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate?" Song Shuhang said darkly, thinking of the class of those who had clearly gone to college but were still in their teenage fantasies, and if they were, they would indeed have such strange nicknames.
Thinking of it, he clicked 'agree'.
Immediately after, another system message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group', do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to press the agreement.
'Shushan under great pressure' agreed to join the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group'.
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to your friends!] There is also a system smiley attached.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang agreed to turn off the prompts and group chat window - he was now drowsy, which has the energy to care what group he added?
Anyway, his group settings have always been 'no message, only number', and group chats don't pop up to bother him, only the number of chats after the group.
When he's more sober, he can flip through the chat logs, and he'll know what group he's in, and the chat logs of the group members won't be lost.
The film progress bar is still tenacious forward, Song Shuhang's consciousness is more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 group, after seeing a new person join the group, there were divers in the group. Beihe Sanren: "Has Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Taoist friend to come in? Hasn't added a new person for more than a year?"
Another ID for 'Su's A7' quickly replied: "There is a new Daoyou? Daoyou is in which district of China? Dao number? How many products have been repaired?"
This series of questions, always feel that there is something wrong?
"Is it a fairy? If it is, report it to the three sides and shine a light!
"Brother Sanlang, do you really belong to the goldfish?" Beihe Sanren sighed, "You don't want to die again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun added a senior to come in?"
Sanlang this guy is good at everything, affectionate and righteous, willing to help others, so the popularity is good - is usually like mouth flowers, do a good death.
This guy's luck value is low and appalling, every time can't help but inadvertently die, it is always the big seniors who offend. These idle egg pain big seniors are sad no fun, naturally very happy to toss the wild knife three waves this door to the fun.
"Kneeling and begging not to mention the words 'great predecessor', there is a shadow in the heart of this seat." Wild knife three waves issued a row of 'tearful' expression.
Four years ago, he had offended a beautiful senior with his broken mouth, and had been tossed around terribly. . . The senior had tossed him around for a whole year and four months. You heard me right, a whole year and four months! His eyes were moist when he thought of those inhuman years.
Three waves just finished saying this, the group popped up one after another smirk expression - undisguised, straightforward schadenfreude.
There were eight people in the group showing their online status, six of whom popped up in unison to brush a row of smiley faces.
"You schadenfreude guys, this seat remembers each of you, do not let this seat meet you, or we must let you taste the experience of this seat's seventy-two-way knife! " Wild knife three waves hate said. He is very confident in his own knife, just smirked at the six guys, not a single word is his opponent.
Three waves of wild swords had just finished.
He has cultivated deeply, and has reached the realm of the Queen of the 5 Pin Lings, and is only two steps away from the King of the 6 Pin Lings, but he cannot beat A7.
He was fast and fierce with seventy-two swords in one hand, and had a body as fast as lightning, but he couldn't beat A7.
He is known as a rabid sword, and when he gets mad, he is even afraid of himself, but he can't beat A7!
The people in the group saw that after the three waves withered, it was a series of unbridled smiles.
". . . " This time, the wild knife three waves can only be depressed to send a series of colons.
The group made a noise for a long time, but did not see the new voice, some doubt.
"The new Taoist friend is silent?" Beihe Sanren asked aloud.
Unfortunately, because of the effects of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has once again entered a state of semi-sleep.
At this time, Su Shi Aqi was very happy to send a message: "I read that the new Taoist friend is called 'Shushan pressure'.Have you ever heard of a master called this number, which sounds like a Confucian practitioner?
In retrospect, the practitioners of Confucianism were even better at fighting than the Buddhists. Not only did they have bad mouths, but their fists were also hard enough. And when they were in the mood to fight, they would also chant poems heroically to cheer them up.
"A seven, I said, your expectations of the new Taoist friends will always only be good or not to fight, as well as to fight cool or not?"
"Er." Su Shi Aqi was a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren smirked: "Will it be another 'big senior' who can't use chat tools? "
When he said that, everyone felt that the scene was very visual?
Yes, it seems that almost four years ago, there was also a senior who left the customs after more than 100 years of seclusion. He also managed to get on the chat software and was joined by Huangshan Zhenjun, but because he could not type, he did not speak.
Then, a guy called crazy knife three waves very happy in front of the senior, and asked the senior to report three, and asked her to send photos, and voice chat or something.
And then... a few days later, he saw his predecessor with his own eyes. It was a beautiful predecessor, as dazzling and beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
Then, the beautiful senior tossed three waves of wild swords for a full year and four months, before leaving contentedly.
At this point, an ID named 'pharmacist' spoke.
Unintelligible short message, no end.
Fortunately, the people in the group had long been accustomed to the pharmacist's brief chat habits - he was asking the group leader Huangshan Zhenjun where?
It is not that the medicine man has a noble and arrogant personality, but because he types with two fingers and handwriting, the speed is slow. When the number of words is high, it is easy to make mistakes, and it is extremely painful to delete and write. So the medicine man is used to speaking as short as he can.
"He went offline immediately after adding people, and heard that his family's baby demon dog ran away from home again, Huangshan Zhenjun went after him again. " Beihe Sanren replied.
... "the drug lord.
"That can only wait for the new Taoist friends to learn to use the chat tool. "
They all have preconceived notions that the new entrants are also like-minded.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang woke up slightly.
"Remember someone just added me to the group, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No. 1 group to come?" He murmured in a low voice, casually clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the Jiuzhou No. 1 group chat window.
What the hell is a group?
Soon, the chat log from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably visited it once.
This seat? Hunting the big demon dog?
Special words in all kinds of faeries.
The way people in the group chat and speak is also interesting - half ancient, half white. It gives the impression that modern people are trying to communicate in the ancient language, but because the ancient language is not good enough, resulting in a very awkward way of communication.
"Whee~~" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
Looks like this is a group built by fairy lovers?
Oh no, this is no ordinary group of fairy fans!
Everyone in the group has given themselves a road name, the place where they live should be called Dongfu, and the owner of the group's lost pet dog should be described as the family demon dog run away from home. There are also people who claim to have not fought a Confucian practitioner for hundreds of years, which means that the person claims to have lived for hundreds of years?
It's a shame just to look at these chat logs.
"This level of obsession, has reached the level of the second disease, and it is very Chinese characteristics of the fairy second." Song Shuhang nodded darkly.
Looks like it's a concentration camp for two sick people in Fairy!
This was his first impression of the Nine Continents One Group and its members.
But why add him to the group?
He looked at the information of Huangshan Zhenjun, the leader of the group, was not his classmate, and he certainly did not know him.
Slender lines of blue flowed down from the tip of the pen. The pale blue lines on the palm-sized card grew, and gradually a complex and mysterious pattern became more and more perfect as the tip of the pen slid.
Suddenly the tip of the pen was heavy, a change from the lightness of the moment, followed by a sharp side hook, pen hook like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly brightened, and then quickly faded down, back to business as usual.
His face remained focused as he finished the card. He had only completed fifteen, ten short of today's task. The one-star power card he was working on was the lowest power card, and it was one of the most widely used and consumed cards.
Just then, the room suddenly went dark.
The meter showed the number one hundred. I did not expect to run out of energy, it seems that today's task will have to add another one. Back at the table, Chen Duixun threw himself into his work, all his livelihood depends on this most paper-grade card.
Chen Dui's room was small, less than forty square meters, and there was a half-used work table in it. In addition to the work table, which was relatively clean, the rest of the room was full of mountains of clutter. It was also a variety of clutter, piles of old books, scattered raw materials.
Chen Dui has lived in this humble place for the past three years. It is a special relief room provided by the federal government, and a small room like this can be occupied for only 150 odis a month. For a poor person like Chen Dui, there is really no cheaper place to live.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Dui finally finished his work for the day--twenty-five energy cards.After carefully counting the number of cards, twice in succession, to make sure that the number was correct, he carefully put the energy cards into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted him, "Ah dusk is coming! "
He answered to the shopkeeper, who was an old man of about fifty, and the years had left a mark on him that could not be concealed: fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Dui carefully removed the card bag from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five. "
Uncle Hua took the card from Chen Dui's hand, put it on the shelf without looking at it, and said with a smile, "Thanks to Ah Dui, you send cards every day, otherwise I would be short of supplies here."
Chen Dui smiled, but did not answer, he knew that Uncle Hua's words were mostly meant as a joke. One-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards, not to mention the fact that it is located near Dongwei University, where can only sell twenty-five energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Dui's temper, no nonsense, directly asked: "A Dui is in need of cash or transfer? "
Chen Dui replied simply, and with that he handed a pale green Decca that he had prepared to Uncle Hua. Chen Dui said good-bye to Uncle Hua after the settlement and wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly called Chen Dui: "A Dui wait a minute. "
Chen Dui stopped and turned to look at Uncle Hua with a little surprise: "Is there anything else? Uncle Hua. "
Uncle Hua took out a piece of yellow paper from the drawer and looked at Chen Dui with a smile: "I almost forgot something. This is a cardmaker training course attendance card, which was sent by the dealer when the goods were purchased yesterday."
He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years, and if it hadn't been for him, Chen believed that life would have been out of reach for him as well.
Three years ago, he just learned how to make energy cards, go around to sell, but few people are interested, no business is willing to buy. The amount of one-star energy cards required is very large, businesses are more willing to buy in large quantities at a time. And Chen Dui can make up to 30 a day, for businesses, this is only a small number is not even a fraction.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua, who agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price of each card was 103 ODI, two ODI less than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. Nevertheless, Chen Dui was extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of one hundred and three odis was lower than the price of one hundred and five, Chen Dui felt that he was surrounded by great joy. He sold all the energy cards he had, bought the cheapest food, and bought all the ingredients for the energy cards with the rest of the money.
Since then, Chen Dui's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, and he didn't have a day off.
For three years, he made only one kind of card, the one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at ninety-five odis, he was able to make a profit of eight odis per energy card, and his daily income was stable at two hundred odis, which three years ago, was a figure he could not have imagined.
Chen Dui smiled at Uncle Hua and said, "Thank you Uncle Hua!" He took the lecture card and carefully put it into the card bag in his arms.
They are often incomparably gorgeous advertising, such as this lecture card on what to say "Eastern Wei University recognized academic qualifications" "Eastern Wei University senior senior business card maker authority to speak" Yunyun, in fact, what is inside Chen Dui clear.The only relationship between the organization hosting this training course and the Eastern Wei University is that the organization each time to pay a fee to the Eastern Wei University, as they maintain this nominal "jointly held" price.
Chen Dui is still going to listen to what the training course is about. Business card printing is one of the most difficult learning, so many years, he has not given up self-study, but little success. Until last year, he did not understand what is going on.
For a teenager without the slightest foundation, trying to teach himself the notoriously difficult and obscure business card printing, it was naturally more difficult. However, he did not have the slightest doubt about his intelligence, and was able to learn to make one-star power cards within a week by memory alone, the business card maker had praised his talent.
From then on, he set aside this goal, which was temporarily too high for him, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical studies.Every day, no matter how tired he was at work, he would find time to study the boring knowledge.
After saying good-bye to Uncle Hua, Chen Dui walked down an alley to the south.It was Saturday, and he had a job.
After a walk of about twenty minutes across two streets, he came to a second-hand card-buying station.
He is also the owner of the buying station, where Chen Dui works for three hours every Saturday and Sunday night.
He looked at me with a smile on his face.
Xiao Hei had long been accustomed to Chen Dui's face. When Chen Dui came here to ask for a short-term job, Xiao Hei would have refused. The buying station had been run by a man since his father, and when it came to his hands, it had also been run by himself.
But when Chen Dui said he did not want to pay, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Dui is still paid, and generally Chen Dui will choose a few used cards to take away as his pay.
Sometimes Chen Dui would pick out a few unused energy cards from the waste pile, and Xiao Hei calculated that every month, he saved a lot of money on it. But for the taciturn Chen Dui, he couldn't help but be a little curious, how did this guy know that there was still energy left in these cards?
But since then, he has smiled every time he sees Chen Dui.
Chen Dui crouched down and began to sort through the piles of discarded cards. There were many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, anthropomorphic cards, and even some of the rarer plant and animal cards. But all of the cards were useless, and all Chen Dui had to do was sort through them.
The work proceeded quickly, and it was evident that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Dui flipped his wrist and tossed a card at Xiao Hei, "Here, this card will last for a while." There was at least half of the energy in the two-star energy card, and Chen Dui couldn't understand why the original owner of the card would waste it. The capacity of the two-star energy card was one thousand, which meant that there was almost five hundred energy in it.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand and smiled. He ran to the energy meter and inserted the card, and when he saw the number "523" lit up on it, Xiao Hei laughed so much that his features were almost huddled together.
Three years of production career, let him have his own understanding of this most common and lowest level of cards. There is not only one way to make a star energy card, Chen Dui has collected twelve different structures of a star energy card from this.
These different structures of one-star energy cards were a great inspiration to Chen Dui, because he used some of the techniques of these cards to successfully reduce the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five odis. But such good fortune does not come every day, and so far, he has only collected twelve.
But today's luck seems to be good.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, from the surface texture, he is a kind of Chen Dui has never encountered another new structure of one-star energy card.
He put the card aside and continued to dig through it. There were so many one-star cards, but Chen Dui took the trouble to check them one by one. He was so fast that he could tell if he wanted one by just running his hand over it.
It all stemmed from his familiarity with the One-Star Power Cards, a familiarity that had come from three years of non-stop work, and he could tell by the feel of his hand, without looking, whether the card was a One-Star Power Card or not, whether it was a structure he had seen. He knew them so well, in every detail.
The fingers that skimmed the edge of the card stopped abruptly.
He got up from the bed.
Her head was dull as if it were not her own, the palms of her hands touched the luxurious sheets, not the old one she used to wash her hair, the overhead lamp, not the half-broken energy-saving lamp style she was used to seeing, her body ached as if it had just been torn by something, and she lifted her wrists, the bruises and purple marks on them were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to make a sound, lifted the covers, and saw that she was naked inside, and screamed almost out of her voice.
Lin limpid eyes in the bottom of the dripping circle twice, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed to pick up the messy clothes, casually put on, and did not look back to run out.
"Ah... let go of me, you let go..." Lin Qing struggled with his hands and feet.
He took her by the hand and led her back to the bed.
His deep eyes seemed to have an innate arrogance, his cheeks were frosty, his nose was high on his white face, and his jade-like skin made her feel envious of the woman who asked herself if her skin was good.
She asked herself how many men she had seen, but the men who were called male gods were suddenly eclipsed in his presence.
Is this the man who spent half the night yesterday tossing her half to death?
"Who sent you, and you drugged me, and you did this and thought you could get out of here unscathed?" He looked at the stunned woman, anger flashing in his dark eyes.
This strange woman, the skin is better than snow, the small face is pleasant, a pair of smart eyes, eyelashes fluttering, like a frightened fawn, and not willing to show weakness of the big open eyes forced to look at him.
Gu Jingze's eyes were fixed on her, and she saw that Lin Li's eyes were turning quickly with her brain.
But she had the wrong man.
In front of the people, although handsome people feel dizzy, but obviously not that super-first-line big star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was on the ground, and she was on the ground, and she was on the ground.
"You're mistaken, and now I'm the one who's badly damaged." Her buttocks hurt, her hands hurt, and the pain below was too much to ignore. Irritated, she yelled out directly, "I'm going to be obsessed with someone else, and you don't have half a dime to do with it. You think you're worth my medicine, and Aunt Ben didn't do it casually.
The wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tight, his eyebrows were twisted into Sichuan characters, and his dark eyes were like dormant beasts, staring at the disheveled woman. Her white half-shoulders were exposed, and there were bruises and red marks on them.
The images of the evening flashed through his mind again, and he felt a sudden heat in his lower abdomen, and again felt the unmistakable heat surging through his body.
away from her face.
This was the first time I'd ever seen him, and it was the first time I'd ever seen him.
When she got out of the car, she looked at him, and he looked at her, and she looked at him.
She ran out of the room.
Hearing him hiss, she exclaimed, "Look at what, look at yourself! "
"You..." Gu Jingze was about to turn around and grab her, but he felt a wave of impatience in his body, and the following had been irrepressibly exalted again.
"Damn it," he swore, clenching his fists to restrain the damn s * * t.
There was a flurry of voices outside.
Qin Hao looked back, his mouth closed in amazement.
What was the situation just now? How did the gentleman's room even run out of a disheveled woman?
He raised his piercing eyes, and his dark eyes shone brightly, so that Qin Hao hurriedly swallowed all the doubts he shouldn't have.
Gu Jingze washed his body in the bathroom until his skin was washed pink, then swore in the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze was stunned, this time, the mother actually came over, a thought also knew it would not be a good thing.
The door to the bathroom opened, and a beautiful woman stood outside, looking at the bed in amazement.
The beds, which had not yet been made up, were clearly telling everyone in front of them what had happened last night.
"I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm very busy today. "
The excitement on her face was hard to hide. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know that you had an affair with a girl."
Gu Jingze opened the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "Will you leave this matter alone? "
"How can I not care, Jingze, you have to marry her, you have to be responsible for other girls. "
"Mother, I won't marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more disturbed by the thought of the woman.
"Do you still think about that Mo Huiling? I tell you, it's impossible for you to be with her, you get along with her for so many years, or you can't touch her, you are simply doomed not to be together!"
"Mother, that's enough!" Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, the family is almost ready for artificial insemination for you to get a child, but you touched a woman today, that means she is the most suitable object for you!"
Taoist famous mountain Qingcheng, since ancient times, there have been countless strange people in and out of it, the so-called reckless hidden dragon snake, this is the case.
Countless myths and legends, countless legends, like a thick cloud, to Qingcheng covered with a veil of mystery.
Morning dew, the mountain slate path, groups of Tsing Yi Road people holding three long incense, silently and quickly on the path, towards the back of the mountain a towering, smooth as a mirror stone wall.
The mountain road is steep, the dew is slippery, but these people are faster than the galloping horse, with a strip of green shadow. More people jump from time to time, the wind flying across a hundred meters, the morning wind blowing, clothes flying together, that floating momentum, like immortals.
Qingchengshan mountains, peaks, major palaces and pavilions, there are Taoist people continue to walk out, in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there were a large group of small Taoists carrying various flags, magic weapons, carrying censers around the Nine Palaces of the Great Array. Cigarettes shot high into the air, and the wind of the wind wound up, turning into a cloud over the heads of the group.
In front of a large number of Taoists, just below the stone wall, a group of wearing gold-rimmed purple Taoist robes, with silver thread embroidered on the chest and back of the eight trigrams, the edge of the sleeves of the robes more Yunxia lines, hundred grass patterns, Zhou body up and down the gorgeous Taoist, is holding the dust, expressionless solemn standing there.
The group waited quietly for a while, and when a red light suddenly jumped up in the east, the red light tore open the heavens and the earth in an instant and sprinkled all over the place, many Taoists prostrated themselves together and reverently performed the three-kneeling-nine-kneeling salute to the stone wall.
Thousands of people were chanting mantras at the same time, and the sound of the 'buzzing' mantras became entwined and spread far and wide as a subtle sound that made people tremble. Gradually, a strange power rose from the mantras, and a bright, colorful glow shone from the heads of the many people, shining on the smooth, polished stone wall.
The Taoists, dressed in gold and purple robes, prostrated themselves on the ground at the same time and mumbled a prayer.
For half an hour, a wisp of white light shone from the top of the stone wall, and soon the whole stone wall was emitting a clear white light.
The smoke rose into the sky, and there were countless clouds of smoke entwined in the stone wall. A few shadowy figures with golden light around their bodies could be seen in the clouds of smoke. The figures became more and more clear, and finally three men, two women, and five Taoists wearing white robes, whose faces were obscured by the golden light, appeared in front of the people.
The woman in the middle looked down at the many Taoists who were kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had a pair of scrolls in her hand, which she threw out.
There was a flash of white light on the stone wall, and the scroll made of purple jade and gold silk slowly floated out, landing on the purple-robed veteran who was leading many Taoists in prostration. The woman who had thrown the scroll said a few words in a low voice, and turned to leave with a few companions around her.
Several purple-robed old men suddenly shouted, "Grandfather mercy, mercy ah! "
The sound of 'Dong Dong' kept ringing, and all the Taoists bowed heavily to the five men and women, knocking their heads on the rocks.
The woman who threw out the scroll gave a cold drink, and suddenly all the Taoists fell to their knees stiffly, not daring to make any more movement sounds.
It was the end of the day, and the end of the night, and the end of the night.
The light of the stone wall dimmed, and the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several things with strange light slowly fell from the sky, namely, a sword, a pearl, a small ding, five charms and nine medicine bottles.
Swords, beads, and small dings are as small as children's playthings, but each one is entwined with a dazzling haze of light, and they are obviously extraordinary things.
Five Fuluo is more entwined with golden light, purple compelling, if there is no pressure wave after wave from the Fuluo, slightly closer to those Taoist footing is not stable, have been pushed back by this force.
The nine vials were densely engraved with all kinds of charms and seals. The old Tao who had just received the scroll opened one of the vials in front of many Taoists, and a secluded medicine chest burst forth. Thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time.
The mere smell of a wisp of medicinal incense was more than enough to overcome the three months of painstaking work of these Taoists. The old man in the purple robe was busy sealing the bottle tightly and firmly. The mere aroma of the elixir had such a magical effect that you could imagine what a treasure the elixir in the bottle was.
Several of the purple-robed elders murmured together for a while, gathered up their swords, beads, dings, runes, and vials, and then unrolled the scroll in front of all the elders.
The first half of the scroll was a scripture on the cultivation of qi, the Sutra of Taixuqi, while the second half of the scroll caused the purple-robed Taoists to lose their color and cry out in dismay. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists swarmed out of Qingcheng Mountain.
Qingchengshan in the secular world of the latent forces launched in full, set off the invisible waves.
Part 1, Chapter 1
In the sweltering heat of July, the asphalt road smelled of pungent paint under the scorching sun, and looked like it was about to melt.
Over the road because of the transpiration of the air, directly twisted and skewed.
Under such a poisonous sun, there were few pedestrians on the streets, even fewer cars, and everyone sought shade from the heat or enjoyed themselves in air-conditioned rooms.
A woman in a starched white shirt and dusty suit pants walked hurriedly, heading straight for the Second People's Hospital.
The hair clung to the woman's face because of the sweat, and the woman's cheeks were unusually red, obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet with sweat, and the feeling of clinging to the body was uncomfortable, but Jonan had no time to worry about that, and clutched the bag with a hundred thousand dollars.
It was the money she had managed to scrape together by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needed two hundred thousand for the operation, and a hundred thousand more had to be found.
Walking straight to the ward, Jonan's hand touched the door guard, and he heard the mother-daughter conversation in the ward.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault, if it wasn't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me," was the voice of Qiao Nan's sister Qiao Ziyi.
"Don't cry, Mom has already taught Qiao Nan a lesson for you."Mother Ding Jiayi touched her eldest daughter's head with pain.
Standing outside Qiao Nan's heart, her sister was not caught by Chen Jun because of infidelity, Chen Jun will leave with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
At the thought of Chen Jun, there was a bleakness in Qiao Nan's eyes.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Ziyi was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child, and Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan, saying that Qiao Nan was hiding misfortune, and that she was a heartless little beast who robbed her sister's boyfriend without saying anything, and forced her own sister to get pregnant.
In the end, Qiao Nan had to withdraw and complete Chen Jun and his sister.
"Mom, Dajun divorced me, the children are not with me, I have this disease again, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't been filial piety to you, I really don't want to die."
In the hospital room, Qiao Ziyi held Ding Jiayi crying hard, she was still so young and had a lot of good days, she really did not want to die.
Hearing that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness, Ding Jiayi was moved to think that she would have to be filial to herself in the future.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Ziyi on the back, "No, Mom will not let you have anything to do with it. Mom has already raised money for you because of the dead girl Qiao Nan."
Not long after his divorce from Chen Jun, Qiao Ziyi developed kidney failure and had to have a kidney replaced immediately.
However, in this marriage relationship, Qiao Ziyi cheating is the wrong party, coupled with Chen Jun is the government work, Qiao Ziyi was clean out of the house, and now sick even to see a doctor to take medicine money.
Hearing this conversation, Jonan, who had known her mother's eccentricity for a long time, could not help but feel pain in her already numb heart.
She was forty years old, and when she broke up with Chen Jun, she never fell in love again, not because she didn't want to talk, but because her mother wouldn't let her talk.
Over the years, most of the money she had earned had gone to her mother, who had used it to buy her sister a 150-square-foot apartment, while she was still confined to a few dozen rented rooms.
She paid for food and even utilities at her parents' house, and every time her sister went back to her mother's house, although she came with some things in her hand, she went back with more.
She did not marry at her age, and was teased that no one wanted her, but Jonan did not know that her mother did not want her to marry, but only wanted her salary.
But it was her mother, and every time she went on a blind date and fell in love, her mother died looking for life, and she couldn't do it.
His hard work over the years, in the end, only in exchange for the "dead girl" three words, especially Qiao Ziyi also put the blame for his own cheating divorce on his own body, Qiao Nan grasped the 100,000 yuan in his hand, suddenly did not want to give Qiao Ziyi.
Before Jonan left, the next conversation Jonan heard was the one that really made Jonan cold and desperate.
What if Qiao Nan raised 200,000 but couldn't find **? In fact, the doctor said that if a relative would donate a kidney to me, the match would be higher and it would be less likely to be rejected.
Leaning on Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Ziyi said pitifully: "If there is a real family * * * means that I can save a little money to see a doctor. "
**Which is so easy to find, some people can't wait until they die for such an opportunity!
Knowing this, Qiao Ziyan knew that if she wanted to live, money was not enough, she had to do something else.
"Would you like Mom to take a blood test?" Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Ziyi shook her head repeatedly, her mother is this age, the kidney must not be better than her, since all, she must want a good: "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me, I can't bear you to use a knife, my father is certainly not able to. "
"That..." Ding Jiayi thought, her eyes bright: "Wait a minute for the dead girl to come, I asked her to take a blood test, she is your own sister, certainly fit! "
"Good is good, but Qiao Nan will not refuse, after all, this is a kidney." Qiao Ziyi's eyes were full of calculation.
In order to live, just in case, she would never let Jonan have the possibility of rejection.
"Miss Qiao, you come to see your sister, why don't you go in?" Qiao Ziyi chatted with Ding Jiayi, and the nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Ziyi's face changed: "Mom..." just her conversation with her mother, all by {Qiao Nan that dead girl heard?
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased him out, and sure enough, he saw Qian Nan's back and yelled Qian Nan's name.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's cry, Qiao Nan refused to turn back or stop, tears continued to fall, but his heart was broken into pieces.
For her mother, her sister, she did not even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister, calculated that her money was not enough, and now she wanted her kidney.
Ding Jiayi did not understand Qiao Ziqing's words, but Qiao Nan did understand, the more so, the more Qiao Nan hated, even if she really owed Qiao's family should be enough!
Joanna's head hurt, and she wanted to tell her mother that it was dangerous on the street, and a car rushed toward her.
"Squeak" and "bang" were two loud bangs, and Jonan was speechless with pain all over her body, but she could barely open her eyes to see how her mother was.
Ding Jiayi was really frightened, and when she saw her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over to her and murmured, "Qiao Nan, it's good for you to die, at least you can help your sister when you die.
The younger daughter was killed, and the person who hit the younger daughter must lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes stared at Ding Jiayi, staring at Ding Jiayi, not waiting for the paramedics to arrive first can not stand to be Ding Jiayi alive!
Part 1, Chapter 1
There's nothing worse than dreaming of heaven one moment and finding yourself in hell the next.
Mo Qian is such a person, two months ago he was sitting in the classroom, fantasizing about being admitted to Xinyi's key university, but at this time he was doing a small job on the construction site in the hot sun.
Remembering his tragic experience, he spat on the ground and raised his hand to wipe the sweat from his face. He had just finished moving a truckload of bricks and was already sweating profusely.
Mo asked, a lad of seventeen or eighteen, with an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean figure, and a pair of somewhat steady eyes.Perhaps the children of the poor had been in charge of the family for a long time, and his young age made him look a bit of a teenager.
Putting the cement truck carrying the bricks to the side of the road, Mo asked for a shady place to sit down. The foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy. In the boring and busy construction site, it was very happy to be lazy for a while.
He sat on a concrete slab, his eyes constantly patrolling the road, and in a moment his eyes lit up; across the road came a graceful figure, which caught his attention.
Although the distance is too far to see each other's faces, but the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
It's not just women walking, but there's a lot of learning in it. And Mo Qian is on the construction site all day, across the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to remember something, and pulled from his breast-clothes a disc of cyan metal, the size of a coin, fastened by a small cyan chain, like a strange necklace.
It was also something that Mo had accidentally found when he was demolishing an old house a few days ago, when he found an old green brick in one of the walls, which was pitted and dilapidated, and was estimated to be a hundred years old.
If other century-old antiques, I'm afraid they can still be worth a little money, but a green brick, even if it's an antique, I'm afraid it's not worth much at all.
At that time, Mo Q casually threw the green brick on the ground, but do not want the green brick from the break, from the inside out of a piece of metal jewelry, it is the strange necklace in Mo Q's hands.
There was something strange about the cyan metal disc, which was divided into eight areas carved with all sorts of strange runes.
Mo Q was not familiar with antiquities, but he could also see that what was in his hands should be a scaled-down version of the gossip plate. Ordinary people would hang the gossip plate in their homes for good luck and evil, and worship it as a magic weapon.
Although he was not superstitious and did not believe in the ability of the gossip plate to avoid evil, he also knew that the ancient gossip plate should be worth a lot of money, perhaps an antique, if sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to become rich overnight.
Mo Q's eyes were full of longing, caressing the gossip necklace as if he were caressing his lover. Once he became a rich man, the BBWs who had only dared to peek at him from afar and slobber in secret were not left to him.
"Something's wrong. Something's wrong!"
Something's wrong! Call an ambulance.
A noisy shout rang out from a short distance, followed by a number of people running to that place, the shout also interrupted Moq's beautiful dream.
He looked at the other side in disbelief, hesitated, got up, and ran to the other side where the crowd was gathered.
A middle-aged man in his late fifties, dressed in rags, lay convulsing on the ground, pale, breathing heavily, his hands clasped to his chest, as if in agony.
From his eyes, filled with deep fear, seemed to feel death.
Many co-workers arrived, but no one dared to come forward, a group of workers without much education obviously did not know what was going on, did not dare to act rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Qian's face changed slightly, and he looked at Lao Zhang, who was convulsing on the ground. He recognized Lao Zhang's symptoms immediately, because there had been a sudden acute myocardial infarction in the village, and he had died in just a few minutes. He had witnessed the whole process.
His village is very remote, there is basically no professional doctor in the village, usually gave birth to a disease or something is simply treated with the earthworks handed down from the ancestors, there is no targeted treatment.
His mother was sickly and tired, and there was no doctor in the village. His biggest dream was to be admitted to the most famous medical university in China and become a doctor to treat his mother and the people in the village.
Unfortunately, he failed in the college entrance examination. He could have been admitted to the medical department of Huaxia University with his score, and he could have obtained the qualification of free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son of the family, and his score was clearly lower than his, but he was pushed down.
Although he could have been admitted to other good schools with his grades, he could not afford the high tuition fees. In order not to burden his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The construction site belongs to the development zone on the edge of the city, far from the city, the nearest hospital ambulance will take 25 minutes to arrive. But look at the patient's appearance, whether you can stick to 25 minutes or two things. Stick to 25 minutes? That's a miracle!
The man he knew, and he lived in the same shed, his name was Zhang Honest, usually everyone called him Lao Zhang, an honest and honest man, because he had no skills, he could only do the lowest level of small work on the construction site like him.
It is said that he also has a son in college, and he worked so hard to earn money for his son to go to college.
Mo asked some hesitantly looking at the ground workmate Lao Zhang, his dream is to become a doctor, some simple and common pathologies have a certain understanding, for acute myocardial infarction, but know that there are several first aid measures can alleviate the condition.
But these days, who dares to save people at will? It's a good thing to be able to save people well, but if you can't save people well, the patient has three strengths and two weaknesses, and I'm afraid the responsibility will be pinned on his head.
Such is the reality of society, perhaps simply take some emergency measures to alleviate the disease, prolong the time of death, can save a life. But Mo Qian, like others around him, did not dare to rush to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was silent for a moment, and finally he sighed and stepped towards Lao Zhang, who was in the midst of his illness. He was not a bad person, but Lao Zhang had a good relationship with him. They were both poor rural people who came out to work, and they deeply understood each other's hardships. Lao Zhang was the pillar of the whole family, and his conscience could not do anything to see Lao Zhang die.
'don't move him, I'm a doctor. '
A graceful figure ran from a distance, all the way through the heavy clutter of the construction site, trotted to the scene of the incident.
Mo asked a little stunned, subconsciously stopped, a gust of fragrant wind hit, in front of his own more than a wonderful figure.
It was a girl, beautiful, tall, only half a head shorter than Mo Qian, wearing a beige floral dress, the hem of which fell at the bend of the leg, showing a pair of slender white calves.
He squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but it was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl! A natural carving of the most beautiful face kept reverberating in his mind! No Zinfandel, but amazing.
He found that the girl in the white dress was the same girl across the street that he had secretly masturbated to her figure, and now he knew that she not only had a good figure, but also a strangely beautiful face.
The girl did not pay attention to Mo's question, directly squatted down to check on Lao Zhang's condition, and soon the beautiful face changed, as if the situation was a bit grim.
Mo Q also knew that at this time the patient appeared in shock, the situation is not optimistic.
'can you help me? '
The girl raised her head and looked anxiously at Mo, who was closest to the patient, and naturally found him for the first time.
'it can be! '
Mo asked slightly stunned, did not expect the girl to ask him for help, but quickly reacted, hurried to the girl.
"Can you help me straighten his body and lift his legs slightly?" the girl asked Mo as she carefully performed chest compression surgery on Lao Zhang.
Mo asked Ben to know some ways to relieve myocardial infarction, and quickly did as the girl said. He knew that the girl said the right way, to raise the patient's legs to prevent the shock of the patient's brain lack of oxygen, now there is no oxygen tank and other equipment, so this is the best solution.
He suddenly noticed that his chest was hot, and getting hotter and hotter, as if there was a red-hot iron stuck to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he unconsciously touched his chest, and found that it was the gossip plate that had been excavated from the blue bricks.
Anlin stood at the top of the tall building, facing the tumultuous wind.
The wind howled, the sense of weightlessness of a sharp fall, and even though he was loveless, he screamed in fright. "Help!!!"
Every part of his body trembled with the fear of imminent death.
Just then, Anlin's whole body was suddenly enveloped in a mysterious white mass of light.
The terrible feeling of being overweight came at that moment, and he felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then going around in an arc and flying up into the sky.
Anlin's screams continued, and his body flew into the sky before landing again on the roof.
The intense weightlessness, and the alternating feeling of life and death, made Anlin feel dizzy in the head, and then indisputably vomited.
"Hello, young man, are you all right?" Just then, an ethereal voice came to Anlin's ear.
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him with a loving face.
The old man must have white hair, fairy wind, the whole body of golden fairy lingering, a pair of holy and flawless appearance.
Seeing this scene, Anlin's whole body was shocked, and countless plots came to mind.
All kinds of plots began to emerge in Anlin's mind, the beginning of all dreams, is not this scene in front of him!
Poof!
Anlin kowtowed heavily and said with tears in his eyes, "Immortals, thank you for saving me! "
The old man, who was called a fairy by Anlin, stroked his white beard and smiled and said, "You are in your prime, young man. Why do you choose to live lightly? "
"My mother died young, and my father was a gambler. " "My father gambled away the house, ran up millions in gambling debts, and then ran away alone!
Millions! What shall I give back?
"Then I was forced to drop out of school and work as a coolie for my creditors. "
Anlin a handful of snot and tears poured out, only to feel that life is a gloomy. A lifetime of debt-paying life, and salty fish what is the difference, might as well be born early.
After hearing Anlin's experience, the fairy also had a sympathetic look in his eyes, and he slowly said, "Young man, your life is really hard ah. . . Well, you and I are predestined to meet each other, and I think you have excellent qualifications, why not let this fairy send you a 'system', so that you can change your life."
Anlin shuddered as he heard the words, he thought he could tie the knot with the immortals, it was a great blessing, but did not expect the immortals to be so generous, even as soon as they met to send the system!
"Wow, Grandpa Fairy, you've been so good to me! I really don't know how to repay you!"
The cactus smiled lovingly, palm to the sky, followed by a pure white ball of light, appeared in his palm.
"Come here, young man, and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand," said the fairy to Anlin.
Hearing the words, Anlin was excited and couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light in his hand, emitting a trace of warmth, the light in the ball, is soft to the extreme.
"Start the system transfer," said the fairy slowly.
As soon as the fairy's words fell, the light on the white ball of light flourished!
Just then, the immortal said to Anlin, "Young man, you swear, swear to accept this God of War system, and never leave it! "
Ares system?
What a domineering name!
But how is this vow like a declaration of marriage?
Without much time to think, Anlin hurriedly said, "I swear, accept the Ares system and never leave it! "
No sooner had Anlin said his vows than the ball of light swished directly into his body and merged with him.
Then a voice rang out in his head: "Detect the host as a celestial physique, qualify, and the system begins to merge! "
Anglin was so excited that she wanted to cry.
Originally thought that his life is gloomy, but did not expect the peak circuit, even at this moment ushered in the life of the open hanging system!
The fairy was also excited, and excited to the point of crying!
"Grandpa Fairy, what's wrong with you, are you all right?" Anlin asked curiously when he saw the old man behaving strangely.
The fairy came to his senses, wiped his tears, and knew he had lost his temper.
"Young man, after you get the system, you have to refuel well."
"Well, I will!" Anlin focused.
"So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortals?" the immortal then asked.
Go to school to fix immortals? Only a fool would refuse!
"Think, I especially want to cultivate immortals!"
The fairy smiled with relief, took out a golden piece of paper, handed it to Anlin, and said, "This is my letter of recommendation. With it, you can study at Xiuxian Union University and officially embark on the path of Xiuxian cultivation."
Anlin was startled, and dared to love the dragon arrogant day to repair the road of immortals, the immortals have paved for themselves!
He solemnly took the letter of recommendation from the fairy to himself and looked at the fairy with a grateful face.
Anlin was very curious about the fairy who had given him a new life.
The fairy caressed the top of Anlin's head with a sympathetic look on his face.
'i've got to go, bye lad. '
The fairy said good-bye to Anlin, and then went away in the clouds.
"Immortals, you go slowly! " Anlin said a grateful obeisance to the fairy flying into the sky.
From the sky came the laughter of the immortals, which was incomparably cheerful, incomparably wanton, as if pouring out a lifetime of grievances.
Why is this fairy so happy, how do you feel happier than I am?
Anlin looked puzzled.
Just then, a female voice rang out in Anlin's consciousness: "Hello."
The woman's voice was beautiful, like the sound of heaven, and she heard Anlin's wit all over her body.
Is this the sound of the system?
Anglin was incredulous.
That's when an interface popped up in Anlin's mind.
The interface is gray and white, with only a few words on it: Ares system features, which will be activated upon entering the Taichu Continent.
What is the ghost of the Taichu mainland?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation from the fairy, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand expectantly.
Then he discovered that the gold paper contained nothing but a slightly indented handprint.
Anlin was a little confused, but still homeopathically placed his hand on the paper, and the handprint coincided.
Suddenly, the paper was golden, and Anlin only had time to be surprised by the "why" sound, and was completely swallowed up by the golden light.
Anlin felt a whirl of heaven and earth, and his vision went from dark to bright again.
Then he found himself high in the air again and began to land freely.
Anlin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off the building, that kind of sour no matter how many times, he wanted to shed tears.
Anlin looked up with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two white gantry pillars, hundreds of feet high, stood between the sky, and the plaque was engraved with a mysterious script that he could not understand.
After the gate, the palaces are thousands and thousands, and there is no end in sight.
Colorful clouds float around the palace, all kinds of spirit animals soar between the heavens and the earth, a grand and magnificent fairy weather.
Anlin stood still, a look of shock on his face.
The original world, there really is a fairyland!
Anlin tried to calm down and calm himself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a robe approaching and hurried up to say hello.
"Hello, fairy sister. " Anlin beckoned to the woman.
When the beautiful woman saw Anlin beckoning to her, she came over.
Seeing this, Anlin asked excitedly, "This beautiful fairy sister, please tell me where this place is. I'm new here, and I don't know much about this place. "
At Anlin's words, the woman looked a little queer, and then said, "Grumbling? "
Ah, what do you say?Anlin was puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as Anlin and said, "Grumble and grunt? "
Anlin was blindsided at this moment, and a terrible conjecture came to his mind.
"Sister Fairy, can you speak Mandarin?" Anlin's eyes were moist.
The beautiful woman had her hands on her hips and was a little angry.
It's over. I don't understand the language.
What the hell is she talking about? I can't understand it at all!
Nani Finally, Anlin cried.
'Roar! '
'Roar! '
'Roar! '
On a platform, hundreds of people gathered around screaming and cheering, and the crowd was surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most notable place is the two cars that are about to start running.
One was the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488, worth more than four million, and the one next to it was the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth half a million.
This is a showdown between Liu Feng, a newly promoted major in Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the top four majors.
In the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han silently leaned against the car door, his clothes were sloppy, his hair was long, and when he bowed his head, his bangs would cover his eyes, people could not see his closed eyes, and from the lower part of his leaking knife-carved cheeks, they could faintly see the unique handsomeness of Zhang Dashao, but now his temperament had become full of decadence.
And Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, like the stars holding the moon, his expression as if to say that the world is at his feet.
"Let's go and see Zhang Dashao, who was once on top. "
Liu Feng waved his hand and led the way with a sneer on his lips.
Zhang Dashao?
"Did you fall asleep? Zhang Dashao, who was invincible before, has now fallen into such a state, tut tut, before the start of the game, what kind of indifference ah my Zhang Dashao!"
The way he is now, I think he is a poor beggar!
"No, I don't think he's even a beggar. Maybe he lives on pig food. "
On the side of the Ford Mustang stood a chubby, bespectacled man with a three- or four-year-old girl on his lap.
The little girl's long pink carved jade, wearing a white dress, delicate little face like a lovely princess in a fairy tale, in addition to some messy hair is perfect, but at this time the little girl's clear big eyes contain tears of grievance, listening to the number of people to Zhang Han, she seems to be on the verge of tears.
If placed in ordinary times, it is estimated that the cute appearance of the little girl will attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng a person's performance time.
There was a knock at the door, and a knock at the door.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes for a moment, there was a blank look in his eyes, seeing the behavior of the people in front of him, his eyes were full of contempt for the world.
"Will the ants dare to bark in front of the Buddha-figure? "
Zhang Han suddenly burst out of his mouth such an inexplicable word.
There was silence, but the next moment there was a roar of ironic laughter.
"Zhang Han, do I think you're crazy? "
"I'm afraid not to become a fool. "
The crowd jeered again, but when Zhang Han saw the picture in front of him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng at Wolfhang Mountain in 2009?" He asked.
'how did I end up here? '
"Am I not crossing the sky?
"Did... I come back?" He asked.
"Have I been reborn by the thunder of the Nine Heavens? " Zhang Han's eyes flashed a tremor.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight families in Shangjing, Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of the day, but when the family took a plane trip, half way was hit by an air crash, his parents and sister were killed, the second uncle Zhang Ming as the head of the family, but also failed to stop the loneliness of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was devastated at the time, believing that his family had been killed, and began a private investigation into Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him, and Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was eventually expelled from the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, Zhang Han refused to leave, has always wanted to find out the matter, the days are very difficult but he has always insisted, until this Wolf Mountain incident.
I remember when I was racing in this wolf mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident, lost my arms, and finally jumped off a cliff for five years. I didn't expect to accidentally enter the world of Xiuzhen. When I began to contact Xiuxian, Zhang Han awakened the gift of magic - smelling treasure nose, his nose can smell the breath of treasures within a certain range.
With this supernatural power, five hundred years of time, Zhang Han hard with all kinds of treasures will be built up to the extreme,
Why not five years ago?
Zhang Han's expression was a little lonely.
Failure to fulfill filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart. Before his relatives left, he was young and reckless and ignorant, causing a lot of trouble for his father, but also said a lot of words that made his mother sad, all of which no matter how remorseful can not be undone.
Baishan filial piety first, although Zhang Han was rebellious, but the love of his parents at the bottom of his heart is not less than others.
The tree wants to be quiet and the wind does not stop, the son wants to raise and kiss does not wait.
Zhang Han!
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he saw Liu Feng looking at himself coldly.
"Five years ago you drove me out of the capital!
Today, five years later, my Los Angeles car king Liu Feng strong return, but you Zhang Han is not as good as a living pig dog! Remember, today I Liu Summit let you Zhang Han sideways out of the capital!
"Oh, so strong?" Zhang Han refused incredulously, "Then I don't compare."
Zhang Han!
Liu Feng shook the keys of the Ferrari in his hand and said, "As long as you win me, the car will be yours."
He said with a smile.
'heh. '
Liu Feng sneered, raised his hand and ordered the people: "Put up the screen! "
At the end of the conversation, the people behind set up a number of television screens, and at the same time in the Wolf Mountain also raised remote-controlled aircraft, open the screen, one by one remote-controlled aircraft camera transmission back, the Wolf Mountain the entire track reflected in it.
'get ready to start! '
Liu Feng nodded darkly to the fat man with glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang and sat down in the Ferrari.
"Daddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys
"It's a cute little girl how to call someone's father? "
He shook his head.
"Hango, you're going to win!" He yelled.
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han and made a look of encouragement.
"By your auspicious words, your car will bring me good luck."
She looked at him and smiled.
"Ready!" He yelled.
The engines of both cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng's mouth hung a wisp of a smug smile.
The fat man on the back leaked a meaningful smile.
The eyes of the lovely princess at his feet were full of fear and worry, and her eyes were filled with tears.
Zhang Han, in the Mustang, had a sneer on his lips.
Collusion to harm me?
"Unfortunately, I'm not the person I was then. " "Even if I don't have any cultivation now, can I wait for the ants to be able to provoke me? "
The first chapter
Rust Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23.
It is also known as the "Magic Tomb".
With the continuous development of the civilization of true cultivation, the magic weapon that used to be high above the world and could only be driven by true cultivators has entered thousands of homes and become an essential tool for ordinary people to travel, study and work at home.
While bringing convenience to life, it also produces a lot of scrap magic and metal waste.
Most of these garbage magic remnants of a lot of psychic power, easy to cause radiation pollution, the construction of magic spells and extremely unstable, and even the risk of explosion, if left unattended, will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there will always be a number of "special waste disposal sites" dedicated to the disposal of end-of-life magic weapons.
Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23 is located in the southern suburb of Fugo City, a major federal cultivation town.
Under the dusk sky, a polluted purple swamp, emitting a strong stench, the peaks made of metal fragments like hundreds of dinosaurs out of the swamp spine, the peaks are studded with broken flying swords, flying swords sitting next to rusty crystal golems, empty eye sockets have long extinguished the spiritual fire, only to feed on psionic worms poking their heads out of it, carefully surveying this crisis-ridden "magic graveyard. "
'Boom! '
Countless metal components such as Tiannu scattered flowers, scattered splashes, and triggered a series of collapses around several mountains of garbage, raising clouds of smoke and dust, like a demon dance, covering the whole sky.
It seems to be a no-go zone for life, with only insignificant cockroaches and worms making it a paradise.
Li Yao lay dormant behind a mountain of garbage, licking his chapped lips, his khaki windbreaker covered with dust, blending in with his environment.
Glancing at the rising explosion cloud not far away, the teenager's clear eyes did not show a bit of emotion, uneventful.
It was only when shards of dirt and metal spattered the mountain of garbage where he was hiding that he shrank a little deeper into the pile and put on goggles big enough to cover half his face.
'it's coming! '
3:52:38 p.m., the daily routine garbage dumping time, is also Li Yao this kind of "garbage bug" revelry time!
The Lingzi watch he wears on his left wrist is a special hunting model introduced three years ago by the "Flying Lingzong" sect of cultivators, and it took him two months to repair it after he found it in a mountain of garbage.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function that can record vibrations of a particular frequency and notify the owner when a particular vibration is heard nearby.
This feature was originally intended to alert hunters to the presence of powerful monsters in the vicinity.
And after Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship was about to appear.
Moments later, with a negligible hum, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the cloud of smoke and dust from the explosion had not yet dissipated, and more than a dozen small black dots were mixed in, making it impossible to distinguish them.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose, and his fingers touched a rune on the side of the goggles.
Scanned by the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined as a round figure, clear.
And the hunting function of the Reiko watch is also firmly locked in the special vibration frequency of one of the junk ships.
Garbage ship 1327, that's you!
From his birth to the age of ten, Li Yao spent ten years in the magic tomb, where he knew every inch of the land and every garbage ship in the sky, the "1327 garbage ship" is responsible for collecting garbage in the "Upper East Side" of Fugo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy area in the city, where many cultivators live, and their discarded magic is the most valuable.
There are many magic weapons that are even intact, but because they are a little old, or a new generation of products has been introduced, they have been discarded by cultivators and wealthy people without care.
To Li Yao, where is this garbage ship, is simply a treasure ship full of gold!
"Swoosh!"
Li Yao's feet, like projectiles, galloped between the mountains of garbage, rushed to the smoke, rushed to the "1327 garbage ship"!
Surrounded by crumbling mountains of garbage, at the foot of the "grunting" bubbling toxic swamp, Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountain forest, from time to time in a prominent part of the garbage mountain to borrow a force, each pedal can be bounced dozens of meters away, the movement of clouds and water, pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, grabbing food with Lao Tzu again!"
Just then, a dozen figures emerged from behind several mountains of garbage, dressed in the same way as Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood-red goggles and Lingzi watch.
The men were armed with shovels and iron bars.
Like Li Yao, they are garbage bugs who rely on the "23rd Special Waste Disposal Site" to eat.
Where there is interest, there is struggle. Shiploads of discarded magic weapons may be just garbage to the cultivators at the top, but to these poor people at the bottom, it is the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best garbage worm in the tomb of magic weapons, and naturally, most of the garbage worms are a thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao, however, did not care, he smiled, the waist suddenly force, the shape of a strange fold, even without warning turned 90 degrees, dodged in front of a cross-eyed obese teenager, but also took advantage of the situation in the fat face of a hard foot, taking advantage of this foot, the whole person skimmed out of the 30 or 40 meters.
"Fat dragon, everyone comes out to eat, than who is faster, you should lose weight! "
A huge red mark on the face of the obese young man, his nose was sinking into the fat, and he screamed in anger, directing his men to pursue him, and the party soon entered the smoke and dust area.
There had just been an explosion here, and it was so unstable that dozens of mountains of garbage would collapse at any time. Even the ferocious Fat Dragon and his gang of teenagers could not help but slow down when they entered the place and watched Li Yao wind up.
The fat dragon spat involuntarily.
The voice did not fall, Li Yao not far from a mountain of garbage inside the explosion again, tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic weapons rushed down like a flash flood!
'it's so spiritual! '
But heard a scream from the smoke: "Little black, help! "
Deeper than the night sky, a black mang electric shot out, in the metal torrent "drip slip" around, and then rushed into the air, but it is a rusty, blade gap, the whole body of the black flying sword, this flying sword has a huge hand guard like black wings open, Li Yao like a drowning man grasping the straw, very clumsy lying on the flying sword, surrounded by black mang, rushed to the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have revealed a huge figure, each garbage ship is hundreds of meters long, round shape like the legendary tortoise supporting the earth, "tortoise shell" densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, flashing, colorful, to help these tens of thousands of tons of weight of the big guy to resist the attack of gravity.
'Blah! '
A hatch in the belly of a "big tortoise" opened, pouring out a vast array of metal components and broken magic weapons, crashing to the ground.
For a moment the spiritual forces of the whole heaven and earth were stirred up frantically, setting off a storm!
Even the tens of thousands of tons of garbage ships were rocking left and right in the psychic wave, jolting violently, and had to be desperately separated to mitigate the disturbance.
Feilong and others do not dare to approach easily, for fear of being affected.
Li Yao is still riding the black flying sword in the wave of psychic power left and right, although the appearance of confusion to the extreme, but as nimble as a loach.
Of course, he did not dare to face the stormy waves, but with more than ten years of survival experience to try to find a relatively calm and safe area between the psychic tides, only to try to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic weapon, near the water platform first got the moon.
At the end of nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship roared like a behemoth, turned around, and sailed lazily back, and the smoke gradually dissipated.
Feilong managed to climb into the center of the dense dumping of garbage, and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand-new mountain of garbage, smiling at him.
"Fuck it!" He yelled.
The fat dragon's face trembled, but the bottom of his heart was quite tangled.
Li Yao's choice of this garbage mountain is quite clever, not the largest garbage mountain, does not look like the most abundant one.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing valuable garbage magic.
If you continue to tangle with Li Yao here, you may be preyed upon by other garbage worms.
There were other garbage bugs looming around, and cheers rang out from many of the mountains of garbage that someone had found something of value.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, a smelly boy, is still a student of the famous "Chixiao Sect Affiliated Second High School" in Fugo City.
The Chixiao Sect is a well-known sect in the southern part of the Union, with great strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned what the true story, but it is not three fists and two feet can deal with, otherwise he would not have single-handedly intruded on the tomb of magic weapons for more than ten years, still alive and kicking, but also fought out the "vulture" nickname!
But it was gone, and where did his face rest?
His nose was still embedded in the flesh!He was tangled in the heart, a strong wind passed, the fat dragon subconsciously reached out a copy, cold, but it was a fist-sized scrap crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and said, "Fat Dragon, everyone is out to beg for life, not just the last time I robbed you of a 'starlight' crystal brain, but also did not kill your father, as for so do not die? Well, I just found a 'green dragon gate' refined 'snapdragon 17' crystal brain, is the most advanced model, can calculate more than five thousand ideas per second, although burned out, I estimate that I can also sell three or four thousand yuan, just as I filial piety to your fat dragon brother, from now on we are even, how about it?"
"You. . . " Fat Dragon did not expect Li Yao to come out like this, suddenly stunned, some can't believe scratching the fat on his face.
"Hey, look over there, the 'Wild Wolf Gang' people are coming, they're not like me as a solo traveler, they will absolutely eat up dozens of mountains of garbage, not even a screw will be left for you! " Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go and sweep the goods! "
A class of garbage bugs scattered and rushed to the mountains of garbage in all directions.
Li Yao breathed a long sigh of relief, sat down in the garbage, bean-sized beads of sweat rolling down his forehead, a smiling face instantly weeping.
"Dead fat man, I managed to find the 'Snapdragon' level crystal brain, in vain cheap you! "
"You wait, is my 'vulture Li Yao' thing so easy to take?
One day you'll eat mine and spit it out, and you'll take mine and give it back to me, with interest, at usury, and you'll know why everyone calls me a vulture who wants his life for his money!
"No, we must speed up, the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are a bunch of miscreants, but they are more unreasonable than the Fat Dragon! "
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save people, not kill myself! "
"Don't lie to Mom, you can't even be a dog planer and save people? Besides, there's no one in the river!"
Wang Yao was speechless. Today, he came down from the mountain and saw people drowning in the river near the village. He jumped down to save people. After he jumped down, he remembered that he did not know how to water at all. What is more ironic is that it was not a person who fell into the water. It was an inflatable doll.
"There are still people in the village who use this thing so stylishly?! "
It was his last thought before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again, he was lying on his kang, next to his parents, frowning.
And then less than a day later, the whole village knew that the stupid contracted mountain, herb-growing college students can not think of, jumped into the river to commit suicide. "Now the children, have not experienced setbacks, can not bear the blow!
"Eighty percent of that child went to school, and now there are famous college students who go home to farm? "
'it is! '
"This medicine, we don't grow it!"
Has been squatting on the side of the smoking bag of the father out of anger out of this sentence, the village people good face, this gossip, Lao Wang listened to the heart of the diaphragm panic, and then continue to plant, lose some money nothing, can not do even the son also lost in.
"Yes, this time listen to the mother, stop growing herbs, another day to go to the city to let your sister help to find a decent job, you Changmao three uncle's children are just a not famous school graduation, found a job in the city, and now they are there to buy a house!" Wang Yao's mother also said.
When Wang Yao heard this, he no longer raised the bar with his parents, and had to nod his head in agreement.
He was a student who graduated from a famous university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with a passion, started his own business, contracted a barren mountain in the village, and wanted to grow herbs and make a fortune. As a result, when he really began to work, he found that growing herbs was far from as simple as he thought.
The first year, the herbs he planted suffered from insect disease, blood money, the second year, the herbs flowered, long leaves just do not grow roots, this is the third year, see a little better, and out of this file broken.
But after he was more comfortable, he went up to Nanshan, which was a barren mountain, probably because of the soil, not too long crops, but there were more than a dozen large chestnut trees, jujube trees, there was a large area of gentle slope on the mountain, where he laboriously cultivated out of several acres of medicine fields, for which he also specially paid people to build a hut on the mountain, connected with electricity, specially care for these acres of medicine fields, wind and rain, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he poured three years of hard work, said to give up, he was really reluctant.
Looking at the growing herbs, he reached out and touched them.
Want to stop trying for a year?
"The herb is detected, the trigger condition is reached, does it activate the system?"
A cold mechanical voice suddenly rang out.
What voice, who?!
All around, there are mountains, water and woods, but there is no one.
Hiss, is it a hallucination?
"Do you activate the system?" Asks one.
The sound of the instrument rang out again, and it seemed to be at hand.
There's a ghost!
Wang Yao is full of a stirring spirit.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he uttered these words, a curtain of light appeared in front of him, like a panel of figures in the midst of Wang's worries.
Hallucinations, it must be hallucinations.
He shook his head vigorously, and the curtain of light that had appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Just then, a local dog rushed down the hill and came to him, tongue out, tail wagging, very happy.
"Three fresh, where have you been again?
This was Wang Yao's native dog, which had accompanied him on the mountain for three years. One man and one dog entered the hut on the mountain, and Wang Yao went to bed, feeling a little dizzy.
What the hell was that just now?
He recited the name of the unit on one side, and the curtain of light reappeared as if projected.
'it's coming again! '
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that the object was not an illusion, but a real thing that could not be explained by science. It had character attributes, skills, and packages, just like an online game.
Career Level: Rookie (Actually, you're not even a bird, at most an egg!
Physical fitness 1, strength 0.9, mental 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average for a normal adult male).
Is this true? He's completely blindfolded.
Great, he's growing herbs now, that's what's missing!Wang Yao, who came to his senses, jumped up excitedly, startling the "three fresh" on the sidelines.
There is also a skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to point but did not look at it.
"Why can't I open it?" he asked subconsciously.
"Herbs can't grow well, and you want to do something else, shovel shit! "
As if to hear his question, such a line popped up on the panel.
Shit, what's going on here? Who designed it? Come out, I promise I won't kill you!
Wang Worry looked in the middle of the parcel column and found a sign like a kettle.
Ancient spring pot, containing ancient spring water, a bucket a day.
How do you use it? reach for it?
Wang Yao thought of a move, more than a thing in his hand, it is a wooden kettle, antique, holding in his hand, but also quite a bit of weight, gently shaking, there is water rattling inside.
There is water! Ancient spring water?
He took a bucket from the room and poured out the water from the jug, a small jug, but the water kept coming out until the whole bucket was full.
How amazing is that?
Wang Yao stared at the water in the bucket, very clean and pure, reached out and took a mouthful into his mouth, very sweet.
It's delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. He drank three full bowls before he stopped, and when he drank the water, he felt much more comfortable, and his tiredness was gone.
Wang Wang, on the side of the three fresh around the bucket circle.
Come on, you can have a drink, too.
Wang Yao gave him a bowl of water to drink from, and the dog quickly drank it up, then barked and waggled his tail, obviously not enough to drink.
All right, let you drink enough!
The man and the dog drank half a bucket, and if they hadn't panicked, it was estimated that the bucket of water would have been consumed by them.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1 I want to lose weight!
On a scorching summer day, the Chiyun Rainforest, located in the eastern part of the Federation, is filled with clouds and mist, as if surrounded by a layer of gossamer, towering ancient trees, crisscrossing, luxuriant canopy, and sometimes a few birds soar into the sky, hissing.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist forever, is no longer in people's memory, but many years ago, by a huge indescribable bronze sword, directly pierced, revealing a small half of the tip of the sword!
This ancient sword seems to experience eons of time, from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes, more a strong pressure, forming a halo, enveloping the firmament, as if it can suppress the earth, let all beings worship!
From a distance, the scene of the Jianyang rainforest, like a picture, until the distant humming sound, was broken. A large red hot air balloon ship, is slowly flying above the rainforest.
The cabin of the hot air balloon was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and many young men and women could be seen on the deck in groups of three or five, sometimes with laughter.
They are students from Phoenix, one of the students admitted to the Federal Fourth Avenue Academy, the Ethereal Taoist Academy, are taking the airship belonging to the Ethereal Taoist Academy, across thousands of miles, to study at the Ethereal Taoist Academy.
Perhaps it is the expectation of schooling, the journey for these young men and women is not boring, between men and women, there is some hazy attraction, so that this journey of thousands of miles, do not have some fun.
Because of the long distance, the airship is equipped with a canteen, spiritual room, infirmary and other areas.
At the moment, there were many students in the airship's dining hall, and at one of the tables sat a little fat man with a straight belly.
The little fat man, about seventeen or eighteen years of age, in a large blue robe, with a round little face that was barely visible, was patting his stomach and making a popping sound as he looked ruefully at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
"This meal will go up three pounds, why can't I help it, I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young ah."
The little fat man's face was sad, and when he was full of remorse, he hiccuped. The little fat man's name was Wang Baole, and he was also a student who was admitted to the Ethereal Taoist Academy this time. His dream in life was to become an official, and to become the president of the Federation was his lifelong pursuit.
In his memory, when he was a child, his father often patted his head emphatically and lamented.
"Baole, it's better to be an official, you have to remember that although money can solve everything, but will still be bullied, want not to be bullied, only to be an official, become a superior person."
At first, Wang Baole did not understand, until he was in primary school, because he did not hand in his homework on time, was reprimanded by the monitor, after he sent two pieces of sugar, and was named by the monitor, to the teacher small report, all this, in his young mind, left an indelible imprint.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be a monitor, not to bully people, but so that he could not be bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he found that he could bully the monitor a lot more, so he felt that becoming the biggest official, that is, the president of the Federation, no one would really dare to bully him. The reason why he was admitted to the Ethereal Taoist Academy with a sharpened head is also because all senior officials in the Federation graduated from the Fourth Avenue Academy.
But his life is not very good, the family blood is very wonderful, he still remembers a year ago that night, the withered father in the family temple, showed him a genealogy.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the genealogy, he clearly saw that generations of ancestors, but all who weighed more than 200 pounds, all died young, did not live more than 35 years.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream. . . He was reunited with his fat grandfathers before he became president of the Federation.
After a year, for him, weight loss this kind of thing, has risen to a certain height, but even after the Federation entered the spiritual era, with the intensity of Reiki, with the resurgence of ancient martial arts, there are a variety of ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole almost tried all, the weight is still steady progress.
The emergence of memory, let Wang Baole grit his teeth, determined to lose weight tomorrow.
With such a decision, Wang Baole immediately felt a lot less pressure, while picking his teeth, humming a little song, looking up at the blue sky outside the distant window, the brain also began to come alive.
"I don't know if he likes the gift for Dr. Lu, but it's an antique I got out of my house, and the old guy should like it."
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he was next to Dr. Lu, he would have a small backer in the Taoist hospital.
"The teacher's power is limited, but he will have to give some gifts in the future, but Dr. Lu is very old and must have a lot of contacts. I should be on the right track. "
Thinking of it, Wang Baole was happy, only to feel that he was one step closer to the position of President of the Federation.
He was confident that he could become president of the Federation, and this confidence came mainly from all the autobiographies of high-ranking officials he had studied from childhood to adulthood, and even summed up a few tricks of the trade.
At the moment physical and mental pleasure, Wang Baole looked out of the window at the blue sky, also feel particularly beautiful.
But soon, his eyes suddenly widened, noticed the distant sky, there was a black cloud condensation, filled as if to cover the sky, there were thunder and lightning, flashing a flash of light, is slowly approaching, this scene also aroused the attention of many students, out of exclamation.
Wang Baole was also taken aback, it is true that after the Federation entered the spiritual era, due to the emergence of Reiki, resulting in the breeding of a lot of amazing meteorology between heaven and earth, once flying objects are difficult to safety, which led to the birth of hot air balloons powered by Reishi.
With the continuous exclamation, the rumble of thunder suddenly came, loud and startling, you can see in the distance thunder magnetic black clouds rapidly growing, within which the lightning has spread out, like a black net, flashing the sky, dazzling and startling, let people's heartbeat can not help but speed up, the original driving airship, at the moment also slow down.
Just as they were distraught, the door of the canteen was pushed open, as if the wind were howling, and an old man in a white robe walked in. The old man's face was wrinkled, but he was fair-haired, his face was upright, especially his eyes were shining, and his body was upright and scattered in all directions.
"All of you, report to the spiritual room immediately, put on your magnetic suits, and after half a column of incense, we will enter the thunder magnetic zone!"
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the cafeteria were in awe and hurried to stand.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up, in front of the old man, it was Dr. Lu who had given him a gift before, now looking at the other side of the dragon-like momentum, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was right, secretly this old guy must be very human, and he is a chess master.
The old doctor glanced at Wang Baole, grunted, came over, took half a black mask out of his arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At a young age, don't put your mind on some messy places, you haven't entered the Taoist hospital yet, you have learned to give gifts, the old man is also a person with a lot of knowledge, you mask, or keep it for yourself." The old doctor looked solemn, a clean and upright look, as if he hated iron and steel general rebuke.
Wang Baole took the mask, the bottom of his heart gurgled, saw that the old doctor was angry, some anxious, just wanted to explain, but suddenly thought of his own in those high-ranking officials on the autobiography of the summary of the mace, one of which is in front of the boss, thick-skinned for the first time to admit mistakes, often can be small.
So take a deep breath, quickly put on an appearance of contrition, admit the mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong!"
The old doctor was a little surprised, originally to reprimand the words, because the other side so happy to admit the mistake, some can not go on.
Wang Baole saw the old doctor's expression, relieved, and some complacency, secretly this high-ranking official autobiography, is indeed useful ah.
The old doctor grunted, looked up at all the students in the canteen, and pointed to the people with his right hand.
"And you, you are all future students of my Ethereal Taoist Academy, look at what you are like these days, you should always remember, my generation of warriors, first stand up, then stand up, and then stand up!"
The old doctor hated it, and the words reverberated through the cafeteria, causing everyone to bow their heads in shame, while Wang Baole's eyes lit up and he felt that the time had come to express himself.
So he quickly took out a small book from his arms, recorded on it, and from time to time looked up at the old doctor, showing a listening expression, and from time to time nodded earnestly, as if to remember every word said by the other side, this move, but also he summed up in the autobiography of a high-ranking official.
When the other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole like a man of God.
After seeing it, the old doctor also stayed for a moment, an unprecedented sense of weirdness, can't help but come to mind, really he ushered in so many classes of students, this is the first time to meet such a wonderful person, can't help but look at a few more, but gradually sneered.
"Little fellow, the old man's flattery is not so good, you have to thank the thunderstorm, otherwise, the old man can train for three days and three nights at a stretch, I see if you can write it all down in a small book!"
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, the momentum was suddenly different, and the breath of a strong man emanated from his body, as if it were a threat, enveloping the whole cafeteria. All the students were stunned, and only felt that the fight was a foot higher than the old doctor's.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the pocket of the recording jade Jane, weighed for a long time, and looked at the approaching thunderstorm, or gave up the idea of taking out, he felt in front of the boss to encourage, not humiliated.
Seeing the look of the people, the old doctor was proud of his heart, and said a few impassioned words.
"Remember, you must put your mind to cultivation, and in the future, as a person, you must not be greedy, you must not be unrighteous, and you must not always think about finding a female companion.
At this point, all of a sudden, a delicate voice drifted out of the old doctor's microphone bracelet.
"Physician grandpa, where are you, people can't wear this magnetic suit, you come and help me. "
Hearing this, the old doctor trembled involuntarily, forced a dry cough, and gave a serious look at the people, then turned away in a hurry, and at the same time opened his mouth excitedly to the teleportation bracelet. "Oh, come on, baby is not in a hurry, I'll come and help you.
The scene was reversed too quickly, the contrast was too great, all the people were blindsided, even Wang Baole was stunned for a long time before he took a breath, with the people could not help the uproar, Wang Baole gritted his teeth, also scolded a few words.
"This old pervert, what he said before is bullshit! There are only so many female students, and we don't have enough points, and he's so old, and he's still robbing us of resources, isn't he an official by virtue of his size?"
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the more angry he became, and in the discussion with the students around him, his dream of becoming an official became more firm in his heart.
As the sound of the alarm intensified, the people ended their discussion, one by one indignantly went to the spiritual room.
The spiritual room, located in the core area of the airship, as the name suggests, is a place for these students to cultivate, but also the airship in the process of passing through the special area, the most closely protected place.
At this moment in the spiritual room, as the people gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher of the Ethereal Taoist Institute with the ship, all of them sat in several rows, wearing the special magnetic spirit suit of the airship issued by the Ethereal Taoist Institute.
Just put on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole is immersed in the anger of Dr. Lu, casually looked up at the surroundings, already depressed mood, because of a distant look, suddenly more bad, unconscious frown, showing a look of disapproval.
There was a girl with slender legs sitting in front of him, very attractive, but she was also frowning, showing a look of disgust, and it was clear that in their mutual glances, the other was familiar and extremely disgusted.
Obscure!
Both of them murmured inwardly, and hurriedly averted their eyes, as if they were hot-eyed at the sight of each other.
"Wherever you can meet this tablet Dumin, bored to death!" "What's the great thing, is not a broken monitor, and so on to the Daoyuan, with my official mace, Lao Tzu can also mix an official and a half!
Soon, after everyone was dressed, the teachers of the Ethereal Taoist Institute with the ship checked one by one, they explained some precautions, but also sternly warned everyone that after the airship entered the minefield, there was danger, there was a certain possibility of a life-or-death crisis.
When they saw that everyone's looks had changed, the teachers on board the ship left in awe, and the door of the spiritual room was sealed directly, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At the moment, there was still whispered conversation in the ashram, but as time went on, the tension grew stronger, and gradually no one spoke, falling into complete silence.
In the silence as if you could hear your own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in anger, could not help but get nervous, until after half a column of incense, the whole airship suddenly shook, into the thunder magnetic area!
From the outside, the whole thunder magnetic black cloud magnificent, like a big mouth, will be compared with it, very small hot air balloon airship, directly swallowed.
This kind of weather, seems to contain the power of destruction, can sweep all, perhaps only the sky, that round of striking Jianyang, can ignore all, as if looking down on the human world thirty-seven years is not enough, but longer.
This year was the thirty-seventh year of the Spirit.
A.D. 3029, the rapid development of Earth science and technology, no national borders, the realization of the unity of the Earth, entered the era of the Federation, it was at this time, a great sword flew from the stars, penetrated the sun, the world sensation.
The hilt of the great sword, perhaps broken by nature, broke in a great number of fragments in the violent shaking, and scattered all over the starry sky, some of which fell all over the earth.
With the arrival of the bronze sword, with the fall of the debris, the earth suddenly more than a kind of seems to pervade the heavens and the earth, an endless stream of new energy, later named... Reiki!
Reiki, like air, is thick in some places and thin in others, and because the scattered fragments have been acquired by the Federation and various forces, various practices related to cultivation and alchemy, alchemy, and alchemy stones have been found on it, and the words on it are full of ancient meanings, leading people to come into contact with ancient texts, which has become a trend.

As a middle-aged teacher opened his mouth, the old doctor, smoking, smiled.
