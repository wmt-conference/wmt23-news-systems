Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New flower bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht is blooming" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is flourishing" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. Since 2015, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth with the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects will find food at any time. "When the weather is favorable, the bees fly out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Nabu in Geesthacht. He has hives on the property himself.
To ensure that the project not only remains an action by conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January, the season had already started at the Wildhasel
More recently, shrubs such as winter scented hedge cherry and winter snowball are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter fragrant hedge cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide, " can be read there among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants now show flowers. In the first week of January, the season had already started at the Wildhasel. It blooms especially abundantly on the straightening path at the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Quilting keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of you when he looks down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 15 o'clock for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich-born von der Schwanthaler Höh (January 15, 1921), "Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and quilting is my life, I can't imagine myself without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of tap dancers. She says: "We are just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used at first, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we welcome big and small, old and young".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analog is growing again for some
The speed with which our everyday life became digital left us hardly any time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three possibilities. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or they went to a phone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the click of the coins in the machine will not be forgotten. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other's face when calling - videotelephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
How to continue in Moldova? 14 Days for a new Government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), the President Maia Sandu has entrusted the former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with the formation of the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do this. Previously, Recean was one of the president's advisers.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure., as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor country and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau parliament, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) party, founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 will be celebrated properly again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities could not be asked for a long time.
Landesvater Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the Paw Patrol's child hero Chase for his costume.
Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely detached: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
State parliament President Ilse Aigner was looking for no one less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob der Baumeister aka Bauminister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff at Carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the district of Regensburg, does the same to him.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
All for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD parliamentary group leader's passion is hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It was made Royal by FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side Mrs. Andrea.
If things don't work out with politics anymore, he can at least do magic. Nürnberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flying fast as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR Artistic Director Katja Wildermuth and BR Cultural Programme Director Björn Wilhelm.
A little side blow against the climate activists by the Franconian crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be missing either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Bold eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent long-time winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended its title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate shooting errors frighteningly easily to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, nothing was going on with Doll again. After the veteran had given up all chances for a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and had only placed sixth, things did not go better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he surprisingly won by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds over Bö. It was one of only three career successes of Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth from Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden welcomes Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is mainly about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength". With regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a gloomy reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, during which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor had not given much on international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar to me," Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
A short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF search posters? The members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and firing were then seen.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, such public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually after Raudis in the suburban trains or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" to Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world that includes Asia, Africa and Latin America than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) if Mrs. Wagenknecht is standing, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I no longer know anyone in my environment who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level, where there is nothing below.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and antimilitarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It reads: "I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has submitted an application to the competent court for the termination of his civil partnership. I don't comment on details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the shared house in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: last survivor dead
A memorial center was established in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which have been preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth encounters.
A cornering location for 14 houses: everyone knows everyone in Homeien
Northern Lippish Hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in homes. Here the residents will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day race the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup for a long time - and some even come back right away.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "The inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy may rise slightly again, and the opening of China may also temporarily give prices a boost," Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when parking money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher lending rates can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep this in mind, but a high debt level should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently".
The ECB is aiming for price stability with an inflation rate of two percent for the euro area in the medium term. This target mark has been far away for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are significantly driving inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario".
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And maybe he will also be a little more controversial,"he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to a certain extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany pace". In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government is acting so quickly when it matters. But this should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process about what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, people have tried and failed with the classic set of rules. "We should think again whether the previous procedure was really right. Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for us".
However, in view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Trade union warns against breaking up the Bayer Group
The chemical trade union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of CEO at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three mainstays, is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's Executive Board and Bayer's Supervisory Board, told the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription medicines, the consumer Health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of CEO at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals at Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $ 63 billion, which was completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. The Bayer share has been in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. The pressure was put on by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also joined in. Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of investment in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off of "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing the concentrated protest on the street to a government project. Hundreds of thousands are planning to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected again nationwide on Saturday, who want to demonstrate against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the central government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week now.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a no-deductible pension when they reach the age limit. The opponents of the reform believe that people could hardly work longer in many strenuous professions. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population had to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it's not just the retirement age that the government wants to screw up. The increase in the required deposit period for a full pension, which was already decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should increase to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron have already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - everyone was sure of widespread protests and strikes.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to pass the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron's concern about crippling strikes is likely to be even greater at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather awaits - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is a lot of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
in Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "True, this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. But it still determines the weather in Germany".
However, calm high-pressure weather does not necessarily mean sunny weather in winter, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains".
So Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or highly foggy. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually getting stronger sun will nibble on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are expected by 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only by 3 degrees are expected. For this, a weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again be only a tenuous dissolution of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after the fog has cleared. According to the forecasts, the sun shines all day long in high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps. The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator hadert: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia has shown herself to be seriously disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Skiing World Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't put in the performance that I can," the Italian told ZDF after she had threaded in at a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. But Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to keep waiting for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home match in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel nun. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's how life is". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".
Missing girls in Berlin: who saw Viktoriya?

Zelenskyi and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed on a joint conference call to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue".
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is soaked with blood and cannot be carried.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a war party, because the country provides military bases for attacks to Russian troops. Zelensky called on the officials to work for the protection of the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The occasion of the conference was the announcement of the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for Sports, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Paris. "From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to re-admit the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said on dpa's request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "The sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Big sporting events do not take place in a vacuum". Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for the return of athletes from both countries to the international sports arena under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or the place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk up where it happens
"Hey, horny butt!", whistling after the fool in a tight sexy costume and shouting salacious sayings: all this falls under the concept of "catcalling" (eng. Cat calls). The term conceals nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Lost half of the vehicles? : US sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army was "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed, according to the US assessment.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 main battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks abroad," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more focused on the needs of the army. Thus, for example, individual industries can be obliged to supply the Armed forces.
Whirl around the staffing of posts at Heer
Because the post that the former director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Minister of Defense Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
According to the minister, a call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment to a previously vacant job is taking place. She would not comment on the "speculation of a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. These are cleared from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision was based on the "appearance of Postenschacher", says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for National Defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the topic.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for safety, among other things, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "train of cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even at the Swabian-Alemannic Shrovetide, no parades were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were heading even more, reserves would have to be touched - "this is not possible every year". The current deficit is about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for the confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
If you are standing on the wayside on the Rose Monday train in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much with them. Camelle or not, the crowd of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain out of buckets on that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd of people," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne train manager. "This is due to the fact that there has not been a regular Rose Monday procession for two years. The train, of course, can not be replaced by anything".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is generally "deficit", that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and homemade vodka
Ukrainians are not considered to be drinking for nothing. There are domestic beers such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other big breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can not notice a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can also see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But this only applies if he goes on mass sale. There will probably be cheating there too.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants for this in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range were really falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the clouds of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the visibility on the race track for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Cup was awarded". Also in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö missed out on the competition in terms of sports. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory perfectly.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wicks triumph. Johannes Kühn took eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed effort on Wednesday, the Black Forest player left five discs standing this time and disappeared into the cabin as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had entered the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the proficient; they each landed on the edge of the panes and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one,"said sporting director Felix Bitterling, taking his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the court
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee's ball.
Aggressive starting players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Head of referees Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviors of the players that surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike things. We will pay more attention to this again - and we will also sanction it".
Recently, two coaches had also been given space referrals. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. "The coaching behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanlike behavior. We noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike things," Brych said.
The head of the DFB referees, Lutz Michael Fröhlich, pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and impartial people. "Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, which are followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned must then live with this. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal vilification, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees," Fröhlich said. In the most recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior simply should not be heard," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a model effect, imitation results from it. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviors," Fröhlich said. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro in front of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia was third.
The German combiners are not competing at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist hit a car from behind during a slight tailback and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Skulpturenmuseum
Initiated the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (li.) and Georg Elben (re.) standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 15 o'clock in the transitional quarter of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous examples of paintings, she presents the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic, with a focus on the North Rhine-Westphalia of the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate on the wall painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been conducting research on building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at construction in NRW. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued an arrest warrant for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants were issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The accused should be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of this investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. According to the information, one of the accused was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early on Monday morning, a magnitude 7.7 quake had shaken the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude 7.6 quake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
The penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away from us at the age of 95," the left faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is thus losing "an important personality," said the group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and the former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was followed by Lothar de Maizière as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politicians.
The leader of the Left party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important adviser in our party, whose prudence will be lacking".
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was just a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the Volkskammer, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state "quite critically". According to dpa, Modrow criticized in many interviews that German unity had been completed too quickly, that the GDR had fallen down too unconditionally, and that it had been condemned as an "unjust state" too unilaterally.
What happened in the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs on Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho energy supplier, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The situation with the power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and Southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. But in a video message, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24th there will be a war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to the important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, air alarm was triggered late on Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal Government selects consultants for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and transfer any profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very punctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely renovating entire rail corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
Apparently, the external circumstances did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She would have slept badly, she told after the race, was "totally excited", the pulse did not come down even when running in. "Such a race," and that at the Home World Cup, "you can't describe it with words," she said. 11,000 Spectators cheered to the booming schlager music with German flags, the supervisors and the team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She currently ranks fifth in the Overall World Cup. And even though the performance density is significantly higher for the women in the top than for the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were more others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been very tense since 2018. At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Armaments industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been cancelled, further projects are threatened by the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say exactly which investments would be eliminated. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at the present time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The reason for the falling investment amount is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which was fully financed by loans and which the Bundestag had decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these increase, there is therefore less money available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum decreases.
Kupferzell: accident with 3 injured
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway entrance towards Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced. During the turning of the BMW driver there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be hospitalized in a hospital. A total of approximately 20,000 euros of property damage was caused to the two cars.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The world is preoccupied with the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. On Friday evening, more than 200 people thought of the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's supplication in earnest and in silence. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The municipality also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The supplications were also translated into German on the palace Square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already come together at the fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in the Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with a meat insert - Ebersberg
"After dinner you should rest or take a thousand steps ".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because if you are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert thanks to your home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from a field, forest and meadow, you can now use your lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburg, where not only dog owners are frolicking between 12 and 14 o'clock.
Of course, one reason could also lie in the fact that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Because why not learn about the news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? In this way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with a tax consultant, lawyer or investment consultant cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural materials. Fresh fruit, for example, which is next to cheese on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you have not thought about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden salesroom empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "It's a pity, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, because you yourself have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you can also let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You probably have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which you quickly threw on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with a meat insert and during this short lunch trip you have become richer not only by a lamb's back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At about 21 o'clock, the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for an unknown reason, came off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, hit a tree on the side and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of driving incapacity, the collection of a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, total damage of 1000 euros was caused to the Audi.
Donald Trump's Tax Documents: A point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: the tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of the President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a release until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has received the documents in the meantime, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there was a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: there the circle of authorized persons is slightly larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published during the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is constantly leaking from Parliament to the outside.
The chairman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes push people and hamburgers in between just like that. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life in a humorous and thoughtful way. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets a lot straight to the point - and one or the other is also between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 20.30 clock in the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after long flight
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the UK has been caught in Thailand. According to the British Criminal Police NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a court case in which he had been sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempted import of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Meetings at the church table
in Bielefeld
What is served up remains a secret in advance. Because people should come to the Vespers Church primarily to meet others, not because there is something specific on the menu. It starts on this Sunday, then the Neustadt St. Mary's Church becomes a dining room for two weeks.
Cabaret Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, is breaking a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scepticism about science here. In any case, his humor fits very well to Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do- and most importantly, what it can't. Of course, corona also occurs there, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put in front of them: what is really important? All this with a huge wink, unobtrusively and very ironically. And so not only are they entertained well, but they can also learn something new along the way.
Please go to typing... this does not take long, does not hurt and can save the lives of many people.
My phone is ringing with an unknown number. I suppose. This woman is the honest finder of your wallet.
The Nordcon team also writes: "In contrast to our old location, we only have a very few stairs left.

Ten firefighters and two policemen were seriously injured in the explosion, some of them seriously.
Can I dismiss everything as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that city politics has known the advantages for decades and has never questioned them.

I really don't understand why you don't do such events on Sundays. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and spoil the image even more!?
Awesome how well #LuisaNeubauer puts it in a nutshell. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard details and prices of monetization <url> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes are traveling together for the first time (!) to Germany.
I am curious who I will meet there and who I will get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer elf, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she is also a CDU minister.
So this is really nothing new, this is the case with every electronic ticket. Check-in/checkout is another house number.
Certainly no reason to do anything about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Is someone playing #wortify and found the word with all the letters today? If so, please let me know, this is driving me crazy.

1. General information
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat events from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, since they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, are increasingly difficult to hit. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. They cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction process, the game introduction process, the game Abl, the initial input for highest results and the self-test process. The latter mode of operation represents a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Game process
The game process is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks, which become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. For example, a hint may be: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a dot representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the field of view of the player on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he should be well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN the FIRE AREA are displayed in the upper left warning display at the same time.
At times, UFO's flying over the battlefield become visible on the screen. These are safe missiles that observe the combat situation and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player tank. The flying position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A shot by the player brings him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and spins twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the set-up the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game process. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket can be varied. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initial entry for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of the highest scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage, the table with the highest results will be deleted. When clearing (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and inscribed on the screen again to challenge more players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes are automatically inscribed by the computer. After that, the device switches back to the attraction game process. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI gearshift lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, which made this structural unit more stable and ensured proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the center position. The microswitches are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of these switching technologies, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and smooth image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players, in order to make it easier to play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should carry out a certain check to round off the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance cover of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never make plug connections by force. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A connector connection twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the gaming PC board for correct and tight fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check whether the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be indicated when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the panel attached to the housing with an adhesive tape must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. With the help of the DirectX diagnostic program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. To enter the DirectX diagnostic program, please follow these steps: click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. In the text field, enter "dxdiag". The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check whether the graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not with all of these programs it is obvious that they are active, and many are started automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That's why we recommend that you quit such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the icon of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash Guard programs, you should also quit general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to quit all unnecessary background applications". Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it is necessary to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, defragmentation and disk cleanup to keep everything running fine. Then the chances are high that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use otherwise run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to find out about the ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows Help
1. Click the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support", respectively) to access the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the Search field and enter the appropriate keyword, for example, "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a manual that explains how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your video card. So you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the video card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked for me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me as a new means of expression, with the help of which one could push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too eager for "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that conveys sensations. Even if this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can definitely create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but also has far more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can tell a story as well as offer a game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I can hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, during which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles that were previously considered irrefutable. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass by you completely without a trace. David Cage
THE README FILE
There is a ReadMe file on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM where the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed.

Without knowledge in these areas, no repair of the electronic device part should be attempted. The electrical plans form the conclusion. We kindly ask you to carefully observe the instructions of this manual in order to ensure satisfactory operation of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL correspond to the status at the time of printing. SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN THE SENSE OF TECHNICAL PROGRESS, BUT NO OBLIGATION TO RETROFIT! Please note when setting up
Transport damage
As far as external transport damages are recognizable, they must be objected to immediately, recorded on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Mains voltage
The device is set for the mains voltage indicated on the nameplate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched over. According to the VDE regulation, the device is provided with a protective conductor connection and is intended only for dry rooms. Proper operation of the coin system requires correct placement of the device in a horizontal and vertical position. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn off the machine for a short time (unplug it) and turn it on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Before repairing, unplug the power plug! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-conducting parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. ATTENTION,HIGH VOLTAGE! There are about 20000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Replace fuses only with fuses with the same values! A blown fuse signals an overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Game Play
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game process is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In case of alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your territory, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, since you cannot cross your own path, or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be plugged in and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches can be reached.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working properly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming Display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set with the help of the "Sub-test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Application programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits", which may be before the start of the game, can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs so that his own initials (names) and the hit points can be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked - if there is a coin lock. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by throwing in a coin, the credits cannot become zero when adding over 99. A free spin mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Number credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": height of the % number that must be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": level of difficulty of the game process
"Dressing tone": no tone at "0" when stationary
with "1" sound even when stationary (animation sound) "Table model": with "0" stationary device
for "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "Slot Programming" display. High-score program display (highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to highscore, which were selected on the previous display (setting of "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts all over again. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or the plug-in connection W1 is removed, with the device switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted - in the left coin insertion slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted - in the right coin insertion slot. Credits paid: Number of credits given for discarded (revalued coins). Credits granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits granted (Credits Paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, in case of extended or won match. % Free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in sec.: Minutes played/Credits paid + Credits granted
High Score (hit rate): Number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the set-up can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-test" switch. After a single pressure, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that it is possible to set it yourself. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only those values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting has been made, each new variable to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-test" switch. If you press it unintentionally, the default setting appears. The values can be increased or decreased with the "Up" and "Down" switches. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (Memory) FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored in dom, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default setting. This condition probably indicates failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed in each case. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as Banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communication RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, detach the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: failure in the U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when they are read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, multiplexers and decoders connected to them.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (Data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she is supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, she would have been from the length and on the hip gepasst...im I could swim the rest. In addition, the lining material came to you when you opened the package and was distributed everywhere. Just a pity.. She will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my mistake. Then I slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the whole area. Worked without any problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under a year. Since the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We brought him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him for the purpose of size. Now at 12 months we have been looking for him out again and he can use him. He can't even bite with his existing teeth. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calms him down a lot.
Quality is not sufficient / Is unfortunately declining
I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. I would like to send in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, because I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping that it would be like that, but there really can be no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Alas, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more labbrigeren. Overall, the feel of this backpack can not be compared with that of my Lowepro. Also the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy an equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Apparently, quality has its price here. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that he was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is declining.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the electrics series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. The part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then is like a little child with every quarrel and leaves?! At the same time, there were also disagreements, of my feeling, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and was trying to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that this is the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I'm still going to read the fourth part anyway and I hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's friend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more excitement to the story again.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do it! First of all: Sooo bad the movie is not now, as many write. Sure, of course, the story is totally constructed, and always conceived according to the same scheme F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do it! And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie ( and even though I know that it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, the tears are often already shooting in your eyes. That's why Jurassic World has already made The fallen kingdom really neat. It's just a pity that the person just doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance ! Empathy for the environment and living beings :misplaced. 4 Stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been 5 stars in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a movie à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French"- besides, it is calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry- if you get involved with him and don't expect anything from him that he doesn't want to be at all.
Problematic
Tastes like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 Days a package every morning: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea occurs 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, diarrhea has been going on for 1 week already. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger one a full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint into a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, an approximately maroon (slightly darker) came out. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was a complete waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first time I tried it. What was the worst of all, it still stank weeks after application.. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just did not disappear.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating a healthy diet but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
The function is not quite perfect !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with time to "connect" to the mobile phone. This means that it is no longer charging even though you have pressed the "Power On / Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches from the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly, especially in its function, and that's why, for the cost of € 30, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good evaluation comes about. In the end, it is actually a spectacle cleaning cloth, which you get a gift in a slightly smaller form at every optician. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and no better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately I can not exchange it anymore I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far too high more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke down. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I liked shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. he can reproduce sound very loudly... Yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as a bass and is not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loud, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are audible just well enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as a bass, but the frequencies were presented quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to take off a star already. I was expecting more from the frequency response.
very bad
In some places the paint was splintered off and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places as well. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want to have them anymore , but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but like if both dresser was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon has done all this for us and transferred the money back to us. In PRAISE of Amazon
Prefer to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Items are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not find fault with it, as I urgently needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks neatly for it - like chewing gum which, however, does not become hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. Ok for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + beautiful appearance + stable when it is assembled + Shelf board can be positioned as desired
- Doors pop due to magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places
- the supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a little (I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: if it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. In addition, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have forgiven 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packed, see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full points soon.
Wake me up on the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at the same time. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly this is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock, because I thought that it was already morning. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also liked that he has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Great light, insufficient workmanship
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these bulbs. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 numbers - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this in a friendly and fast way, but I only found out about this after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very brightly and evenly. The light color is more in the direction of cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living rooms, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and maybe I will also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is of any help, I would be happy about a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positively. I have been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and It Fits Well In The Hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440℉. **They also do not pass on the heat and can be touched directly with it. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and you are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-Goods Sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping is just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.Here we found out that the part has already been installed before. We have noticed significant scratches and abrasions on all mounting parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (Unfortunately). Only now we saw that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably been delivered and sent back before. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but prefer to spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like that!!!
The product itself is great, unfortunately the outdoor sensor is broken after only 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity are always displayed. This is a great pity, because the device was mounted on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
A strong mower with a weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery was still going briskly through the republic with Hermes today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and the result is a nice cut. The volume is not impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big shortcoming is the catch basket. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you only put it down completely for a short time, then of course it will be compressed and parts of the content will fall out. But what is worse is that the actually practical level indicator already shows red when the catch basket is half full. That would not be so bad if the mower did not lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full may not be the solution now. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite easily. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened nevertheless, the hotbed is still too high there and the screw almost falls out at the front right, because it is not tightened at all although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the cart are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it's impossible to print something like that. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free you could only show how you should lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. I was expecting something more.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be found. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries with it, so that you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but it fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give full marks for it and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper. From mit there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being, as it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been "aired" all the time. After return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Discount from the purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace have gotten a little too big for me personally, so it seems quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which in turn I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simply processed overall, so I have already torn the closure open twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that this will not go well/last long. But for the low price you simply can not expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can not open, amazing! I rubbed it with a little leather care, this will make it even a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now about the function: connects only after some gimmick.... if you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not to be used like that for me! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase in any case, only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I have had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft was rusted off. I bought them again for one reason only, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production error and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic casing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than using only a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
It could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than walking around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At first everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I have not found a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw right away. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: the attachment of the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths due to the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing together first, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread was broken off the third time I mounted it and the entire thing was unusable. Conclusion: if at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually evaluate the goods after the first use. In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller bags / sachets. Not of high quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked well until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it anymore. Battery? Swap. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should approach very carefully with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables with it. Battery life is enough for a very long time. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
fancy dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions.. Price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad that I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I would have just wished that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could also use a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Fingers off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect that such a scrap would be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports supply sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are detected as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, then Rödel makes noises like you haven't heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90s. After minutes you can then either restart the computer because it will not work anymore or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you should definitely not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or even anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it is supposed to, but is not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eyewash, because only the port that is facing up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a stupid extension, I certainly would not have bought this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the appearance and my miscalculation, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So no real mis-purchase, but my euphoria is kept within tight limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for : P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, this does not fit with the adapter. Well, it also keeps so safe and has contact from there... All in all, although a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and stably manufactured in one aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
Lots of performance
Top device. Has been running for months without problems. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings decent performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and therefore I am always on the road at level 2. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head made a very good impression, although the difference in price is very large compared to the original, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is felt to be accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump a few meters, but this is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He is currently holding out for about 1.5h days. Here would be a great solution which would take 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version, unfortunately it is too big for our taste, the battery would not have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You should not deal with the dog with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education classes, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last couple, it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the retaining strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance that I was lucky. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I have wiped it away and I hope that this one will not appear again. A lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It is easy to lie on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but it is the pure luxury for days at the event. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Previously, we took out the seats at the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that she does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test, I can definitely recommend you. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the lappy processing directly on day 1 over several doors. There were no more doors on the 21st door and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, because they almost already pleased him. The parts often get mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the front window. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers are rethinking the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and are doing it better. :\
a real drone
I am excited about the drone. My 7 year old daughter is flying with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually quite enough. I didn't expect anything else at the price that the hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tile or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, nice contact.
Play ok but only playable with compulsion on Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it was not a game CD, but just a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impertinence. Since then, the computer hangs up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime
I was really looking forward to the clock. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The service worked well.... and yet I send them back. Drr big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, located overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore, not useful for me. It's a pity.
A noble case with restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely get a case. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the envelope offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks noble. Unlike many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only there are recesses on the connectors. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible on some QI chargers to be able to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO it is not possible. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well processed!
high-quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put up. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone a little grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.

Persistent cellular microchimerism could play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences was detected.
Persistent microchimerism could induce SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like response.

Are there any special patient characteristics that affect the frequency and severity of adverse events?
Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease only begins in adulthood, it is then called Still's disease with the onset in adulthood ("adult onset Still's disease").
The diagnostic criteria include a characteristic rash, joint complaints, fever flare-ups and leukocytosis as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen and missing titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a long time, whose skin manifestations led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The exanthema of the M. Still is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply limited maculae, which are very volatile.

The assessment of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria are to be demanded for the diagnosis of a malignant melanoma or a melanocytic nevus that is suitable for differential diagnosis.
The prognostically relevant and important tumor parameters for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and uniformly in the histopathological report of malignant melanomas.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnostics in malignant melanomas are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in defenseless children represent a diagnostic challenge.
An early and accurate diagnosis can lead to a rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary, but potentially harmful therapies.
The causative agents are infections with a variety of pathogens, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses are in the foreground.
However, in 25-30% of cases, the respiratory symptomatology is based on non-infectious causes.
Anamnesis, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often of little help in finding a diagnosis.
However, often the analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage results in a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%, the remaining cases have to be diagnosed - with the appropriate clinic - by a mostly open lung biopsy.
Mostly women of younger to middle age are affected.

We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical picture of an IMDE (type I).
The particular interest of this casuistry is the fact that there is no dependence on light, which has also been shown by the fact that no deterioration has occurred under PUVA therapy.
It is likely that IMDE is a special disease from the group of forms of elastolytic diseases, in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Based on the pre- and postoperative computed tomograms (CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our goal was to check the efficiency of the direct reduction of stenosing posterior edge fragments performed under intraoperative, sonographic control.
51%) than in the cases without neurological disorders (reduction ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is wider than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates a greater constriction.
In the case of fractures without neurological signs of failure, fragment reposition promises to prevent late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there are indications of ultrasound analgesia depending on the prescribed power density (LD) in patients with non-radicular back pain under serial application.
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult-to-repair mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal part of the mandible can also be successfully treated by monocortical mini-plate osteosynthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additionally form a ranking value for the classification of a trauma, seems to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between the two therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for the description of a mandibular trauma that all studies conducted so far can only provide a rough differential indication with their low case numbers.
As long as there is no prospective multicenter study available that could provide a decision-making aid in the choice of the osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to the functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid range between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization ("comparative genomic hybridization", CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and underrepresentations of DNA sections.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, a software was developed that enables the objective recording of the location and nature of the changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures, created from the tomography data of a patient.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance with the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned as well as with the spatial orientation in the operating room.
After the successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction of laboratory analyses are now leading more and more to a new re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed near the patient, outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of the POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, as well as the need for only small sample quantities.
Although these advantages are often highlighted, they are not accompanied by a clearly recognizable clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of the POCT such as improper handling and / or maintenance of the analytical instruments by the untrained station staff, lack or lack of calibration and / or quality control, costs due to the provision of several devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between the POCT results and the routine laboratory results are also obvious.
According to the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should be made only in the closest cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure the meaningfulness and high quality of the analyzes.
Taking into account the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.), the spectrum of parameters of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analytes necessary for this should be:
Hemoglobin or hematocrit, Activated whole blood coagulation time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
The prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermal stability of contrast media and thermosensitive contrast media are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still at the very beginning of development.
It is possible that MR tomography can become of considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Characteristic skeletal changes occur in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the bone mass changes of the spine during long-term hemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Out of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spinal columns were completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly.
The vertebral body heights (SDI), the bone volume (BV /TV) and the intertrabecular linkage (TBPf) were evaluated quantitatively.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV /TV) in the normal range.
BV / TV shows a distribution over the spine known from the skeletal healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve profile decreasing from the cervical spine to the lumbar spine is 5% lower for the ROP.
The BV / TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with prolonged hemodialysis have higher BV/TV values, regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological cross-linking of spongiasa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis at ROP results in a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be derived on the 2-D section planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis for maintaining an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of inguinal hernia that did not correspond to what was previously known due to its course of the disease and the dissection results obtained by Littré himself.
100 Years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this sacking of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall rupture in a scientific paper on "ruptures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
On the basis of a case report, the historical processing of this hernia form takes place.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder, the first description of which was made by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was only in the 80s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was only included in the ICD-10 as a diagnosis in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the malfunction is unclear.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome, who had epilepsy and internal abnormalities at the same time, is presented.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsies are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections usually manifest as febrile gastro-enteritis or pseudoappendicitis in childhood.
A child is reported in whom Yersinia infection manifested as tumor-shaped lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was established by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various external yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after a course of therapy with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings return to normal.
The application of pulse oximetry in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were investigated as to which conclusions the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation allow and what consequences result from these findings.
The investigation shows that pulse oximetry seems to be suitable in a high percentage for quality control of the resuscitation measures performed.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.

In a 58-year-old patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative period after vaginal hysterectomy, and in the further course the picture of septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected in this autologous blood preserve, and Propionibacterium acnes was detected in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous hemotherapy also carries a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal infections in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a serious infection caused by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with a VACTERL association, who, after candida sepsis, developed fungal zoars in the renal pelvis, which led to hydronephrosis with the onset of postrenal renal failure.
Under antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and fluzytosin, as well as direct irrigation with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy, the excretory function was normalized.
With an increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should also consider the possibility of bezoar formation in order to be able to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method of treating acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy or only insufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the following parameters:
Skin type, minimum dose of erythema, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, it was found that the non-responders have a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and of specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, a strong germ colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestine with Candida albicans was found comparatively more frequently in the non-responders.
These findings show that the high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopy syndrome and on the other hand by complicating superinfections.
The latter finding indicates that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment could be useful for these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
Based on two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is shown.
Clinically, there are subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates, which can lead to ulceration and cicatricial retractions.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
A further diagnostic indication is also a positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology are of particular importance, since lupus erythematosus profundus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has existed for more than 45 years.
The patient died under the clinical signs of a cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of an autoptically and toxicological confirmed vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been an intensive research interest regarding the mechanisms of the development of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapeutic methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies on the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse forms for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, at a high age, with limited cardiac pumping function, after previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires a risk stratification, with which the surgical risk is divided into "low", "medium" and "high" l‰flt.
Pr‰, intra- and postoperative patient-, structure- and treatment-related factors can be distinguished.
On the basis of this prediction l‰, the perioperative course can be optimized by individually tailored, pr‰, intra- and postoperative, multiprofessional and interdisciplinary‰r organized management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, especially spinaliomas and basaliomas.
We are reporting about a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, a spinalioma and a lymph node metastasis of a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complement analysis, which revealed an assignment to the complement group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies on the chest, thoracic wall and / or abdominal wall that have been untreated for years and have been exulcerated in the meantime present the plastic surgeon with the need for large defect coverings after tumor resection has taken place.
The use of silver-containing activated carbon fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn) made it possible to avoid infection after flank replacement by omentoplasty in the context of resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary meshgraft coverage, fibrosing and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable hull wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The health care reform in Germany in 2000 does little to change the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The monopolies of the hospitals for inpatient care and the established contract doctors for outpatient care are not affected.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be prescribed for outpatient operations that may not be performed inpatient.
The obligation of quality assurance is specified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system is being introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure is a complex immunological process, which is influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide and whose activity is reflected only minimally in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis includes the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8 and the inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibit the activation of NF-B and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and system-wide.
If one characterizes this immune reactivity, one will perhaps ultimately also better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and a potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually nonspecific.
Radiographically, only brightenings in the bone are often detectable, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radio-opacities.
Root tip resorptions can be another important finding.
After a brief historical outline, based on the currently valid WHO classification, a brief presentation will be given on the current state of knowledge for each individual type.
From this, the currently valid therapy concept is then developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, relapsing and non-relapsing tumors.
Generalized mood disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness that is often recognized only late, for which a uniformity of mental experience in the face of circumstances is characteristic, as they are usually the cause of depressive mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusation or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person affected and prevent adverse individual and social long-term consequences.
To date, acute purulent meningitis is a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate-onset therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a targeted therapy regimen that intervenes in the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological sequelae and preserve the life of the patient.
This article presents the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special consideration of molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/ denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandibula and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in distinguishing bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique makes it possible to accurately characterize pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of the currently available studies on oral IC therapy were neither randomized, double-blind nor placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, therefore, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report about a 39-year-old Turk who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and clinically resemble dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratoses or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective keratinization.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be distinguished from severe, congenital cornification disorders, which show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytically active substances are often used in cardioanesthesia for procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC).
However, at the same time, there are concerns about their potential as a trigger of thrombotic complications.
In the present case, therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECZEMA should be compared with each other.
The imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
The involvement of the manubriosteranl joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig due to endophthalmitis.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients of the "Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study".
In this retrospective work, the functional results of surgical treatment should be studied.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of a Pseudologia phantastica in his childhood.
The determining factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this work.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late form of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the characteristic HLA B27 are to be tested.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms existing since the age of 14 is presented.
This is not an independent obsessive-compulsive disorder, but schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
In the one-year catamnesis, neither psychotic symptoms nor any significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms are found under the therapy of the schizophrenic symptomatology with clozapine, which worsens in the 31st year of life.
While the literature increasingly points to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication range of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia improved by clozapine is described here - as far as the author is aware.
The importance of differential diagnostics of obsessive-compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of the individual case.
An isomorphic irritation effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to nonspecific skin stimuli.
It is reported about the triggering of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by a UV-B light test with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in which new foci of psoriasis developed in the viral florescences after a varicella infection.
Since the person concerned was planning a stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed anamnesis, clinical and laboratory chemical examinations were carried out.
The presentation was made to exclude an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to the question of genetic risk factors to develop such a disease, and to the question of whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a vaccination reaction;
Initial experiences and results with 13 one-stage reconstructions of large complex defects in the head and neck area with 8 microvascularly anastomosed forearm transplants and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major islet lobes are reported.
There were no complete flap losses in any case.
With the free forearm graft, better functional and aesthetic results were achieved, but the operation times required for the reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are, above all, the poor modelability and a limited radius of rotation.
It was used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular transplant would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While up to now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was primarily considered as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, recently there have been indications that exogenous factors can also put endothelial cells in a state ready for inflammation without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in the metal ion concentration or the oxygen partial pressure as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Thus, endothelial cells are not only subject to the control of tissue-specific mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/ glaucoma surgery, are an indication for the local administration of rtPA.
We report on our results.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of myofibroblastic cells arranged palisade-like in sections (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin), their diagnostic criteria include hemorrhage zones accentuated to the periphery and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is significant for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel inner rails, obstruction and kinking could be reduced and a regression of the congestion of the proximal hollow system could be achieved.
Furthermore, in addition to the urine flow within the splints, this technique allows an increased flow between the splints, which is considered to be the decisive mechanism of urine passage in the case of lying ureteral splints.
In cases of extrinsic ureter compression, in which the insertion of a singular inner splint cannot achieve a sufficient regression of the ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral inner double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative that requires the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures for some patients can spare.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc hernias (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy /APLD/ laser decompression / chemonucleolysis), the intradiscal application of chymopapain is the method with the longest clinical duration of use and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis allows for an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
In a prospective study, the value of diuresis sonography in comparison with the diuresis nephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorder should be investigated.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basaliomas.
The method has been further developed and modified over the past 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same goal:
radical tumor removal while sparing the non-affected tissue of the environment.
However, they have significant differences with regard to the technique of tumor excision, the consolidation of histological sections and histological evaluation of preparations.
A methodological inventory is made and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latent period between the primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The"Marjolin ulcer" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedicled A. radialis flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with the epidural application of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is presented, also in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient controlled analgesia").
Various advantages are attributed to the intrathecal application mode over the epidural.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It seems that the neurotoxicity of opioids is dependent on different forms of administration.
Regarding the quality of analgesia, the serious side effects, the amount of opioid administered or the postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of a thoracic injection over a lumbar injection.
There is probably evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the first-choice method for patients at high preoperative risk and at the same time cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests at the participating centers are recorded centrally in Germany.
For the present study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996 retrospectively.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Peru balsam and thiomersal most often showed reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also compiled for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema localization, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and special questions.
The percentage of positive reactions for nickel, fragrance mix and Peru balm in men was significantly lower than in women.
Younger patients were more likely to respond to thiomersal, older ones to medical externa.
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found more frequently in hand eczema sufferers.
Higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens were found in nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of diagnostics and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all people infected with M. leprae (who have come into contact), the disease does not openly come to the outbreak.
The clinical appearance is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T-cell-mediated immune response.
In this review article, current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnostics of leprosy are considered.
Recently, a large number of studies have been presented on the quantitative investigation of the tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (KW) using laser tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison to the tyndall intensity in the KW for uveitis of different localization, it should be investigated by way of example to what extent the tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disorder in each case.
This experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defensive reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive experimental animal results do not stand up to clinical review, since inferior regeneration performances can occur in animal experiments despite an impaired regeneration pathway.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term consequences is the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, one-third had cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter, chronic complaints and late consequences of ascendant genital infections occurred during the course of the disease.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other opportunistic infections typical of AIDS, but it usually occurs before the actual symptomatology.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed to an increased extent.
As complications in pregnancy, premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, prematurity are especially noteworthy.
No progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy was observed.
Risks for peripartum infection transmission to the fetus are advanced HIV infection of the mother with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as prematurity, premature labor, amniotic infection, duration of rupture of the bladder and labor, as well as amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of an increased maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by a primary low-contamination cesarean delivery (4-6%) and most successfully by primary sectio and simultaneous prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells occupy a central position in the initialization of the immune response, because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system, which T-lymphocytes can activate via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies on patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized with tumor antigens in vitro can be successfully used for immunotherapy in vivo.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in the tumor tissue and their function are known so far for laryngeal cancer, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and the glottis was examined immunohistologically in the present study.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, are detectable mainly in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with the clinical parameters, it is found that the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor of the disease.
An increased homocysteine is considered a significant factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
In the present study, in addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways transulfuration (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were also determined in patients with renal insufficiency.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the anamnesis and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in the years 1984-94 of a university polyclinic or a dermatologist's practice was carried out on the basis of patient records and partly also by follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The median age was 41,0 +/- 15,6 Years, the average duration of illness 7,9 +/- 5,8 Years.
46.4% of the patients had atopy, 23.2% had other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and Wäme-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were positive only in isolated cases.
44 Patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 mio IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracyclines 2 g /d for 2 weeks, n=10), complete remission was achieved in 13 patients and improvement was achieved in 8.
Spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment successes with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old patient who presented herself primarily with a lumbalgia is reported.
From a laboratory, radiological and histopathological point of view, the findings primarily indicated the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebral body, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
Histologically, the picture of a nonspecific inflammation was found in the repeatedly obtained sample excisions.
Only during the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal was it possible to detect histologically a highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
There was a chemotherapy according to the CHOP scheme and a radiotherapeutic treatment.
Lymphomas of the spine should be taken into account as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive courses.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO-fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or fractures of the frontal base in over 90% of cases.
Concomitant skull base fractures in up to 70% of cases pass through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa.
There are different concepts for the treatment of isolated NEO-fractures as well as combined NEO- and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
In the period from 1990 to 1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO- and midface fractures without the involvement of the base of the skull, the reduction and care was carried out via a subcranial access route.
47 Patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extra- and transcranial treatment of fractures of the ethmoid bone with the involvement of the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
however, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and especially phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be surgically treated.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in the end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in PaCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures with cardiac massage and intravenous administration of epinephrine and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In the case of fulminant pulmonary embolism in particular, a systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed with continued cardiac pressure massage.
After 21/4-hour cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics could be achieved with continuous, maximum-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
As a result of lysis and losscoagulopathy, a massive transfusion was required.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of "pulmonary embolism" was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with continuous resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were dispensed with.
When anesthetized with the new inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount supplied is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting serum peak values of inorganic fluoride determine, in particular, the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficient-th.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated the question of whether the fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use or during prolonged anesthesia, nor when used in renal insufficiency patients, an increased renal hazard potential for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane could be detected.
The recently detected low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for the fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol / l still used in the literature to date was derived from the historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, as they are found, inter alia, following anaesthesia with sevoflurane, are therefore to be classified as clinically safe.
There are also no experimental or clinical indications for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of the macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance.
The best results are provided by the basic parallel lamination of the heart ventricles to be performed after the fixation and the transverse lamination of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can precede it.
In this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, longitudinal, circumferential and transmural expansion of infarcts, their age and subsequent conditions can be better detected and assigned to the respective coronary care area than in the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood stream.
On the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed just as unscathed as the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in the case of acute cardiac death and only briefly survived territorial ischemia.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be detected in correlation with coronary morphology and coronary care area.
However, recent prospectively randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection does not provide an additional survival advantage.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for squamous carcinoma of the esophagus as well as for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, oesophagogastric junction and stomach have not been conclusive to date.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, no convincing prognostic gain could be shown in several Phase III studies by preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined radio/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal procedure can only be expected in response to the pretreatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radiotherapy / chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in squamous carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out in the context of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is exceptional for childhood, is usually associated only with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or "hysterical" symptom formations can be understood as the processing of traumatic childhood and youth experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Memories of traumas that cannot be assimilated have a retraumatizing effect and must be averted, for example, by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior or social "acting".
On this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathymic-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the resource-oriented imagination.
The actual trauma work consists in a dosed, stably confronting, but as little as possible retraumatizing introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and leaving behind.
In the final phase, it is again about the resource-oriented turn to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the past 20 years in terms of diagnoses and the proportion of multi-disabled people.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor cerebri"), venous outflow obstruction is possible as a cause.
It was investigated to what extent the visual acuity remains stable in the long-term course after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy, and which causes and risk factors for a deterioration of the visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entrance gate.
After inoculation, the HIV multiplication may have started after 24 hours, and the HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
The prospective HIV infection can be detected by antibody tests within four to twelve weeks, the antibody response is weakened under therapy;
with nuleic acid tests, the detection succeeds from about the eleventh day.
In an almost 100-year development, countless endogenous, foreign and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadrupled tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some limitations, the use of cadaveric transplants is also justified.
The individual grafts have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the mentioned grafts could not be verified.
When choosing a transplant, it is necessary to take into account the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
In the treatment of complex ligament injuries and in cases of revision, careful, preoperative planning with possibly modified graft selection is required.
The rare course of the development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed 2 times in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological work-up showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands in each case, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological features taking into account the literature are discussed.
Coronary lime is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance differs depending on whether the lime screening is performed in patients with already known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant sub-aspect of coronary heart disease.
In this work, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, with regard to ergometry, are presented, as well as hints for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice are given.
We report about 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and diabetes mellitus type I (IDDM) and prediabetes, respectively.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred as part of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we did not observe a case of ITP among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, one should exclude other diseases from the group of forms of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
Securing the airways after operations in the area of the upper airways can be problematic for certain patients.
Therefore, care must be taken for a safe reintubation in case of need.
Two patients are reported who had significant intubation difficulties due to papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma and thus high risk factors for intubation and, if necessary, reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiber-optically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and stage classification of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor propagation pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for the stage classification and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive examinations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity is less high with both methods than initially expected, which results in a tendency to overestimate the tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two incision imaging methods is important from a clinical point of view, since it makes it possible to exclude neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucous tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable information on a possible etiology, on the extent of submucous growth and on the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators (ICD) reduces the cardiovascular mortality of patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with terminal renal insufficiency have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only a small number of cases of myocardial revascularization by PTCA in patients who are chronically on dialysis, which suggest a high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate overall.
We examined the restenosis rate in 23 patients with end-stage renal insufficiency (17 men, 6 women, middle age:
52,5 +/- 18,3 Years).
After primary successful PTCA, a recoronar angiography was performed in all patients within 6-12 months.
Before angiographic control, 12 patients complained of the recurrence of pectanginous complaints.
From a laboratory point of view, the patients had hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in the fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg /dl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient is described in which complete instability of the pelvis occurred within one year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.
As a triggering event, a minor trauma for the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed.
Due to the X-ray morphology of multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignant event was first of all in the foreground during the differential diagnosis.
The cause of hip pain in childhood is a wide range of different clinical pictures.
The non-traumatic causes are mainly included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand, and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Some common, but also rarer clinical pictures are demonstrated by exemplary examples.
The iatrogenic rupture of the major trochanter during the prosthetic restoration of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "posterior access" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated and here used for comparison traumatic trochanter detachment, even with significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still the subject of controversial debate.
The present work presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of various methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
On the basis of the ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and the treatment results, the further utilization behavior of the patients as well as aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
This shows that the relationship between treatment results and satisfaction is not particularly large.
In the further utilization behavior, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are relatively very large, but in absolute terms, these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in the aging process of the male are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although the testosterone level decreases on average with age, correlations between complaints in middle and older age and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to the methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men and a variety of influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea that has existed for five days was subjected to ultrasonography before the planned lysis therapy after nuclear medicine indicated a pulmonary embolism in stage II-III.
A right atrial, floating thrombus was found.
In the case of an existing acute vital hazard, an ultra-high-dose short-term streptokinase lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the thrombosis of the leg had largely resolved.
The treated patients were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in road accidents.
A single fracture was detected in 50% of patients, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytraumas.
The average hospitalization period was 17 days and the average use of crutches was 21 weeks, which indicates a relatively rapid healing process.
In the majority (85%), the treatment went without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with open fracture in 9 (1.8%), and in patients with closed fractures in only 2 cases (0.4%), which is within the framework of the usual norms.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics for head and neck tumors is still the subject of controversial debate.
In the present retrospective study, based on the profiles of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract, it was investigated which factors influence the frequency and localization of distant metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The distant metastasis rate was positively correlated with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001), as well as with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a secondary tumor outside the ENT area (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumor localization' and 'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, did not have an independent predictive value, but essentially reflected different frequencies of the tumor stages.
At the time of the initial diagnosis, the remote metastasis search for tumors of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to an X-ray examination of the thorax.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy and / or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumors, for relapses and for secondary tumors outside the ENT area.
However, one should always ask the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
In this article, a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the 19th century to our time is given.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who were working with great enthusiasm and in "productive Orthodoxy" on the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in Germany in 1927.
Moreover, to rediscover him as a pioneer can be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions of the professional societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "Psychotherapeutic medicine".
Nevertheless, Simmel's emphasis should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany due to their Jewish descent, will no longer be given due consideration.
Basically, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is of central importance here.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a completely individual problem.
The aim of the investigation was the meta-analytical processing of all available randomized, controlled studies in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in the framework of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and visual-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term by systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to one-sided compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc in more than 80% of cases occurs on the side of compression, it is necessary to assume a causal relationship.
Since this disorder also reduces the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space becomes even greater with the herniated disc.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for the malignant changes in the area of the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and burdened with a high perioperative morbidity, as well as lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be performed in the patients in a blood-saving and almost complication-free manner.
With a median follow-up time of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, and in one patient who underwent surgery for gastrinoma, increased gastrin levels were found in late postoperatively.
Compared to the preoperative function test, it was found that the endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly impaired by the operation.
With strict indications, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can thus be treated adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications and without permanent restriction of the exo- and endocrine functions by a duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and /or prognostically significant bradycardiac cardiac arrhythmias.
About one in six patients dies of sudden cardiac death after pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly due to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrostimulation of the heart can carry the risk of triggering and / or aggravation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Especially in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-to-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, among others.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable, but above all even safer for the patient.
The staging, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative objectives, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are given alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including the liver and adrenal glands), ultrasonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, e.g. after chest wall infiltration, and in patients with a contrast agent allergy, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition or as an alternative to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F]2-flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) for the assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, in-111-octreotide / somatostatin scans for staging / diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, as well as the thallium-201 SPECT, the clinical significance of which is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, will be also increasingly used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently still being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor rezoptor, could play an important role in the staging of bronchus carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgical interventions in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and small pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs may occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and also reproductive age, the prevention of such concomitant symptoms is given special importance in tumor therapy.
Impairment of erection or disorders of ejaculation can occur after surgical, radiotherapy or drug therapy of various tumors.
Due to an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are preventable to a high percentage today.
If it is not possible to avoid damage to the corresponding nerve pathways due to the required radicality of the surgical intervention in order to curatively treat the tumor disease, sexual dysfunctions are a significant restriction on the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erection disorders can be treated by a number of therapy modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly being used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known to date about the perfusion characteristics of the neck vessels at different cannulation localizations.
It is reported about a truck driver after bruising trauma of both legs, who developed an atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under medical thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
in addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with a positive antibody detection against heparin:
During our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically split on the left lower leg.
After excluding possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies to heparin (heparin platelet factor-4 complex detection) could be detected 2 days later.
Immediately after rinsing an intravenous access with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction, which could be immediately broken by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, which is otherwise called characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of the thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the various forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without a drop in platelets, and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the "Histological Typing of Salivary gland Tumors" of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1991.
The first description goes back to Ellis U. Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for about 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
happy. parotid gland is the seat of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enormous manifestations are described only as casuistry;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists in an operative tumor extirpation with sufficient safety distance and histologically controlled tumor freedom of all resection margins.
According to the current state of knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma is associated with a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenous metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal-experimental model of renal xenotransplantation was developed, within the framework of which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs on wistar rats as recipient animals, end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or V. cava and ureter drainage by splinting were used for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation with the help of the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on the renal xenografts.
A total of 24 xenotransplantations were performed and randomly treated with 3 ml of 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg / kg of sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in terms of prolonging the graft survival time (from 10,5 +/- 2,1 min in the control group for at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity in the sCR1 group was found, which is due to a modulatory effect of the sCR1.
Histologically, platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates were found en masse in the control group as early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion.
The kidney grafts treated with sCR1, on the other hand, had a significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study revealed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the therapy group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic procedures on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and hernia have been performed in our house with the robotic arm for optical guidance controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is determined directly by the surgeon's commands.
During all interventions, the control of the robot arm was precise, the speech recognition was accurate and without technical problems.
29 Procedures could be performed by one surgeon alone as a "solo surgery".
For a further 20 procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopically active surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications by the DSA in kidney and pancreatic transplants requires invasive intervention in vessels that are usually pre-damaged by diabetes, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated on the basis of a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation between the trauma surgeons and the medical clinic of the clinic Minden.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapy result and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both in terms of the local remediation of the infection, as well as the functional result.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization, which promote an interruption of the wave fronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
Thus, the mechanisms of atrial cardioversion seem to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the kostoklavicular space.
Casuistically, the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus as a result of a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is one of the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was the determination of the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patient population of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the Children's Clinic of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction is reported after the use of absorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement plastic surgery, which led to a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was a sterile inflammation with the detection of foreign body giant cells.
Primary‰re plasmocytomas of the kidney represent a gross rarity.
So far, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in whom an operated kidney tumor histologically proved to be a plasmocytoma.
Based on this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
With multiple myeloma with kidney involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only in the presence of renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primaryrenal involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
As part of a multicenter, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, a treatment indication corresponding to the fracture type or a suitable therapy method was selected for 646 documented distal radius fractures of the adult.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
To date, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known that follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 Patients with an acquired strip-shaped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he singled out as a new entity.
We are reporting on another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are a strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without an inflammatory preliminary stage and without subsequent sclerosing or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "atrophodermia linearis moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be safely carried out as a home workout.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movements and basic knowledge of anatomy, the development of arthrosis and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors is imparted.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was proven in a prospectively randomized examination.
The correct alignment and size of the implants is of great importance for successful and permanent knee joint replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are presented.
In the context of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has proven to be suitable for separating sick patients from secured controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital first aid was initially provided to 274 acutely injured (58%) or sick (42%) children up to the age of 14 with regard to the timing of the missions, compliance with the aid period, age and gender distribution, severity, trauma causes and injury patterns, the type of acute pediatric disease, prehospital emergency diagnostics and therapy, as well as the means of transport and the target clinic is examined on the basis of the emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the Orthopaedic University Hospital Mainz has been checking which clinical pictures can be usefully used for low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations in diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in the context of the present study on volunteers.
A therapy control is currently not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the condition after cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without a real tendency to relapse are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
An absolute prerequisite for the P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
A P-wave triggering must take place, the filtering of the P-wave must be carried out bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is highly desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in the P-wave duration from patients without this rhythm disturbance.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic drug does not affect the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In conclusion, the signal averaging of the P wave after optimization of the method makes it possible to identify patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
The prerequisite for an efficient pain therapy is the knowledge of the genesis of pain.
In most post-traumatic pains, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are directed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is based on violations of the nervous system.
Central mechanisms of sensitization at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to a chronification of such pains.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics have a fixed importance, especially in chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapy standards must be observed.
Blockades with local anesthetics as a monotherapy of chronic pain are obsolete today.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockades have a special significance in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In the case of T3 / 4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of the para-aortic lymph drainage pathways does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival compared to the sole irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are available only from studies with outdated irradiation technology.
Radiation therapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be carried out within the framework of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
However, due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as their special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitely treated by a thin-caliber drainage.
On the other hand, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated for a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. for ventilator patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnostics.
A hematothorax due to a thoracic or abdominal trauma should be quickly supplied with a Bülau drainage and, if necessary, surgically supplied because of the risk of severe blood loss.
Spontaneous hemothorax also requires drainage and internal examination.
The doctor in an internal intensive care unit must master the diagnostics and therapy of pneumo- and hematothorax.
The question posed by this prospective case-by-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information on the clinical findings, routine laboratory examinations, microbiology and radiology.
The lethality, the overall injury severity, the probability of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic accompanying injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. the pelvic injury with accompanying peripelvin soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the care of organ lesions is the focus of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabulum fractures pose a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
With an increase in the number of these additional pathologies, the long-term result worsens.
The primary accident-related cartilage damage seems to have a significant influence on the long-term result after acetabulum fractures.
Isolated calcifying atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old patient, as in coarctation of the aorta.
Remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or an expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of the photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids takes place via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
With reference to the change in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has recently been called into question.
In the discourse on the application and development of reproductive techniques, the aspects of the experience of those affected fade into the background.
Many people only ask for help outside of medical treatment at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastatic localization in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic methods of therapy depends on the histology, the detection of extra-skeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
Hormone therapy is the first-choice therapy for receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer.
In the case of receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or in the detection of liver metastases, chemotherapy is indicated.
In the case of small-cell bronchial carcinomas, chemotherapy should generally be performed.
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, the indication for systemic therapy is rather reserved and is limited, in particular, to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in the imaging detection of a response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for the determination of bone degradation products in the urine could prove to be valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve strain pain should be investigated.
The risk of becoming infected with HIV at work is subjectively often considered to be great.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
For example, hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccinations, for example, there is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In case of injuries with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-exposedly.
There is no drug-based post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon in case of detection of HCV RNA seems to have a high success rate.
In preparations of a videothoracoscopically obtained lung biopsy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strongly positive reactions both in the muscularly differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth-muscular proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation up to 5 cm in diameter in the left frontal lobe.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidney, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion on issues of euthanasia, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to give preference to medical assistance for suicide over active homicide - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the suicide allowance of a psychiatrist in 1994 gives reason to study this issue from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecnos) was investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
Differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, stroma and vessels could be detected both by means of the NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemically.
In the case of the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there seems to be a pronounced reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out due to the small number of preparations.
In the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of the NOS depending on the vessel section could also be detected by means of the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional blood circulation and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and a variety of ileus causes, the surgical indication and the surgical procedure choice for the small intestinal mileus are difficult to standardize.
A uniform procedure for intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of an intestinal splint) and abdominal wall closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical intervention.
Surgical techniques of small intestine implication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), whereby the operation according to Noble has been largely replaced by the plication according to Child-Phillips and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no confirmed indications or contraindications for plicatures, long probes and other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socio-economic significance of the small intestine mileus, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive field of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and its public discussion can make it possible to increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, and at the same time prevent misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the affected couples.
Gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength of depressed persons have often been described in the clinical literature, but have hardly been studied empirically so far.
We recorded various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework, which is essentially based on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressed persons were examined by means of standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which record stride length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace and 3-min walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy experimental subjects.
The examination course was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement of the symptomatology.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy could be demonstrated, in particular, in knee and elbow extension and also in all gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the context of this pilot study are suitable for the reliable and low-stress investigation of relationships between depression and motor skills and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can lead to an acute attack of glaucoma in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or there may be a chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely leads to pressure regulation.
We report on the results after cataract surgery in subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
The influence of autogenic training (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was studied in 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS).
Compared to healthy controls (N), the scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7,1 +/- 3,2 pmol/l, N 1,6 +/- 1,6 pmol/l).
Apart from occasional deviations, the VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences from the normal values (x +/- s:
PS patients 10,7 +/- 7,1 pmol/l, N 12,0 +/- 5,3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed a progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex and memory phenomena in lymphocytes up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.
The -L-Fukosi- dase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (<3% of the normal value).
To date, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We are reporting about a 4.6-year-old girl who came to the hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiosurgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine.
With this routinely performed test, strongly positive results for ketones were obtained during the autopsy of three people who had clearly died as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without the glucose in the urine being increased at the same time.
Using headspace gas chromatography, excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg / L were detected in all three urine samples.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal glucose in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid for the detection of death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study on 94 patients with a traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it will be examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can make statements about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide information for the therapeutic procedure.
Infantile acro-localized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in the context of various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, papules and papulovesicles appeared eruptively symmetrically on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) primary infection, whereas serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are mainly based on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation and discus dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations have been described as a complication in a number of neurological diseases.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis, and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Fire marks can lead to significant psychosocial stress.
The present study investigated a) the coping behavior, the quality of life and the body experience of patients with fire marks and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on the psychosocial parameters.
As part of the therapy with the flash lamp-pulsed dye laser, a psychological test on the areas of disease management, quality of life and body experience was carried out on 70 patients with fire marks.
The clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the lesion during the course of therapy.
Patients with Feuermalen had comparable high levels of stress in terms of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the fire mark.
In terms of helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients with Feuermalen were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
The body experience is influenced differentially by the disease management.
Since the lightening in the course of laser therapy significantly correlates with reduced psychosocial stresses, flash lamp-pulsed dye laser therapy can also be considered effective for fire spots with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most often affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is an independent clinical picture, since the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and in the stage classification of the PGIL.
The gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological manifestations and a wide spectrum in imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic possibilities.
A 43-year-old man had a nevus sebaceus in the area of the right temple since birth.
During the histopathological examination, 2 adnexal neoplasms associated with the lesion were revealed:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, the appearance of Q spikes, newly appeared left bundle branch block) and elevated values of the "classical cardiac enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementias.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia in a patient over 80 years of age, which occurred within a few months.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the course of therapy of the disease that allows the differentiation between a primarily degenerative dementia with hypothyroidism present at the same time and a dementia caused secondary by hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, a near-term aneurysm of the left subclavian artery could be successfully eliminated by implanting a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graft.
The follow-up over a year showed a very good long-term result with a freely perfused stent lumen and a completely switched off aneurysm.
In a control computed tomography, a completely thrombosed aneurysmal sac was found.
In the intravascular ultrasound, there was no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent.
The pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a separate entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.
Nevertheless, already in the first half of the 19th century there are illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost necessarily suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains, in addition to casuistics of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin, also individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared completely unexpectedly under the then common mercury therapy.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this extensive therapy with mercury, since they healed spontaneously after its discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of the pyoderma gangrenosum can be found more than 100 years before the first designation.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not been sufficiently clarified to this day.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of Pyoderma gangraenosum persisted in several publications until well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study deals with the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions after a TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/R) occurs more quickly than after a balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Even estradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher compared to TTS treatment in order to achieve effective, but strongly fluctuating drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high doses of estrogen with oral administration are necessary, since there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism during the passage of the liver.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation, in which there is a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The aim of the present study was to measure the physical resilience of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-dependent changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or tumors of the urinary bladder was to better meet the biology of the various lesions and to make a sharper separation between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinic in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically considered.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, as well as papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, as well as carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to show relationships between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by an intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
One then speaks of a sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and the acute herpes zoster.
For people with chronic sleep and back problems, there is a significant relationship between sleep quality and the quality of the mattress.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question intravenous tumor expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI can represent a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindication to non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated (not yet requiring dialysis) renal insufficiency and patients with symptomatic polycystic kidney degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries of the eye in childhood are cauterization, burn, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign body, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants/year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
The risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (<5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care.
In addition to rapid and adequate therapy, the prognosis with regard to visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is also influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or masking of the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis).
Deficits and imbalances of the spinal stabilizing muscles are considered to be significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back complaints.
Therefore, the preservation and restoration of the full performance of the muscles stabilizing the spine must be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation, in addition to the training of coordinative skills and the learning of spine-appropriate behavior.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, the physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including the procedures on a neurophysiological basis, the physical-balneological measures and the supplementary behavioral training, the medical training therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In their phase structure, various therapy goals are presented, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation course.
The indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation of physiotherapists and treating doctors.
The surgical indication for vertebral sliding results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, from radicular functional disorders.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity remains and in the case of spondyloptoses, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass can occur with further progression of sliding.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, the reduction of severe sliding processes and the restoration of a normal spinal column and trunk shape with a justifiable neurological risk is also possible today.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, the anatomical reduction of the sliding vertebra is also the goal in any case.
Depending on the extent of the sliding, reduction and stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
A dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
At grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this article, is to evaluate the effects of a gerontopsychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and elderly counseling) to undergo an empirical examination for the first time on the transition process from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical-outpatient, i. w. house-based) regional care structures required and justified by the Expert Commission of the Federal Government.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional supply structures of geriatric psychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and elderly care (subsystem C) are analyzed by comparing the supply region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the Gütersloh district (with GZ).
The investigation shows with regard to subsystem A that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selecting its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
One effect of the GZ on the system of elderly care (subsystem C) may be expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh care region the rate of home admission after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive restriction of movement in the right shoulder joint.
Sonographically and computed tomographically, in addition to edema of the skin and adipose tissue, extensive fluid accumulations around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitiums and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint were detected.
With systemic corticoid therapy, the skin lesions healed quickly, and in the further course also the mobility in the shoulder joint was restored.
In the case described, the involvement of structures close to the joints in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated for the first time using modern imaging methods.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin / cyclophosphamide allows breast-conserving treatment for larger tumors that are not primarily suitable for breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be followed by mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
Good reproducibility and availability speak for mammography.
Tumors that cannot be identified by mammography can usually be visualized by sonography.
In MRI, the tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It also allows the recording of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residuals after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited by all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially noninvasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even with regression of the invasive tumor and typically indicate intraductal, noninvasive tumor residuals.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
Using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, this report discusses the treatment of pronounced GBS in the intensive care unit.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be able to immediately create an emerging dissection and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical treatment methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, based on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-pronged functional model clarifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei were successfully tested in the MPTP-damaged patient. - The clinic is currently using both lesional and restorative and stimulating procedures.
The previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological target localization.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigor, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter method has proven itself for the treatment of tremor.
Only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a new sprouting of dopaminergic neurons and an increased striatal dopamine release documented;
However, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
The high-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
The animal-experimental approach involves xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, many years of comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic Al-coholism (SESA syndrome) is, in addition to more common diseases such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal spasm, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome, a rare secondary alcohol disease.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic side-accentuated steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
The laboratory tests showed increased values for Gamma-GT and MCV.
In the CCT and cerebral MRI, microangiopathy and brain atrophy were revealed.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-fold anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and deterioration of the general condition were still observed.
Several EEG studies revealed periodic steep left parietookcipital stressed waves.
Three months after the onset of the symptomatology, the patient died of pneumonia.
The described clinical picture corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basaliomas in childhood and adolescence without association with a basal cell nevus syndrome (BZNS), a xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (so far 86 cases in the world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of BZNS or the consequence of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on the repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage have not yet been available in these patients.
It is reported about a 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basalioma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical examination gave evidence of a genetic predisposition to the development of basal cell carcinoma.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was carried out on the basis of iliac crest biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leuk‰mie (CML) in order to compare morphological and clinical findings and to reduce the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Using the morphometric analysis, it was possible to calculate significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their front‰shore cells, with the fiber density.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already observed in about 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68 + macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f + nucleated erythropoietic precursor cells, which can be related to the integration of this cell line in iron metabolism, H‰globin synthesis, as well as the degradation of the excreted normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, it was possible to calculate significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in the formation with clinical parameters such as the H‰moglobin level, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in the peripheral blood and the spleen size.
These variables obviously mark more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
Corresponding h‰matological data were to be assigned to this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies on 173 patients who received monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN in contrast to a rather fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the mainquantitative cell lines during treatment are best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the comparison of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the assigned temporal differences.
Thus, in patients with a complete h‰matological remission after IFN administration, the regeneration of erythropoiesis was noticeable along with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups revealed a "transition from a (non-fibrous) granulocyte‰ren as well as megakaryocyte‰ren subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of the patients during ongoing examinations.
This Ph‰noun was in contrast to a number‰rapid reduction of the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients receiving HU therapy, in 17% (36%).
In summary, the striking heterogeneity of the bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using suitable methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 patients admitted one after another in a medical-geriatric department were to be diagnosed with a naturalistic design in terms of mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination and the values in the mini-mental state examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as not amenable to examination.
The remaining 74 patients were examined clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
If necessary, dementia-related developments were detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, in more than half of them the disorder was relevant for the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used have proven to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains open how the therapy of the mental disorder required for every 5th to 6th patient after this result can be guaranteed in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
The inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages, since the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are investigator dependence, lack of standardization so far, as well as the still relatively high costs.
That is why the "Working Group Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatism Center Berlin", which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also carried out and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Job's syndrome, Buckley's syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system, which can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically, strongly elevated IgE concentrations in the serum with the simultaneous absence of indications of allergic and parasitic diseases are indicative.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be extremely well tolerated and well effective.
More than a year after the one-time therapy, the symptomatology is continuously improved.
The current state of knowledge and the available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, an IVIG therapy trial should be a first-choice option.
The present work presents the results after laparoscopic "floppy nits" fundoplication in 70 patients on the basis of quality of life data 3 years after the operation.
The individual subdimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
Over 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new antireflux operation if necessary.
Persistent side effects of the operation that do not affect the quality of life, however, were reported by 4 patients.
No patient needed a new drug antireflux therapy.
A laparoscopic refundoplicatio was necessary due to persistent dysphagia in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months.
The effectiveness of surgical therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic "floppy nits" fundoplication can be documented and proven in the long term not only by objective findings, but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by measuring quality of life data.
The clinical symptomatology with neuroglucopenia is groundbreaking, proving the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycemia in the hunger test.
The standard operation is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on the size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seem superior to selective tumor removal.
In malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable according to § 216 StGB;
it is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
The various tendencies to make "killing on demand" as in the Netherlands and in Germany unpunished under certain conditions do not change this.
Nutrient components as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished from immunologically active cells of the intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine becomes clear, especially in seriously ill people.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are particularly important as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are fermented bacterially in the lower parts of the intestine to mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
Among other things, these exert a trophic effect on the colon mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the food-independent substances, it is mainly the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the preservation of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological well-being.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual assessments of situational influencing factors of care on the one hand and stress-promoting active factors in the care process on the other.
The results show large individual differences with regard to the evaluation of the stress factors as well as their effects on the physical and psychological state.
Extension fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the ankle joints.
The early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term result.
Computed tomography (CT) is indispensable for the definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be taken.
Dislocated fractures are treated conservatively, as described in the literature and according to one's own experience, lead to pain and movement restriction and thus to arthrotic reconstruction of the subtalar joint in the long term.
In the indication for an operative procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to allow a consequent healing.
Debris fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unexplained, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, a proliferation of dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in the serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional cutaneous mast cells in indolent mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
In contrast to the general assumption, acute urticaria is rarely based on IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In contrast, pseudoallergies to food (73%) and less often chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) usually play a role in chronic urticaria, with long-lasting remissions with avoidance (diet) or elimination of the triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly to be regarded as secondary and not as disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a vitally threatening injury pattern in the context of polytraumas.
The 3 case reports are intended to represent the variability of the possible injuries along with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which is usually only to be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the time course of polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of care are pointed out.
Reports of previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small patient group show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, whereby cross-references to the management are made together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly vitally threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course over 2 months to 35.2 years is known (median 3.6 years;
A weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found at higher T-stages, there were increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In the statistical analysis, the e-cadherin expression proved to be (<= 20 %/ > 20 %), a synchronous remote metastasis (M0 / pM1, cM1) as well as the radicality of the intervention (R0 / R1, 2) are prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more a danger for adults due to the postponement of the age peak.
With the MMR combination vaccination, an effective method for the prevention of this disease and its sequelae is available.
With the 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination, measles and mumps can be eliminated and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and compatibility.
In a regional comparison, personality differences were found in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.
Meaningful interactions between age group and region resulted in openness and in some subtests of the cognition measurement as well as in the doctor's judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ in more than 80% and arise mostly after abdominal surgical interventions.
In terms of anatomy, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Today, sonographically or CT-controlled percutaneous abscess drainage is a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of about 80% for a defined indication.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventionally, pancreatic, spleen and Crohn's abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and provide pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities.
Since the mid-to-late 80s, various research groups have been trying to improve the prediction of premature birth in prematurity by immunological diagnostics - in particular by cytokine detection.
However, it has proven to be disadvantageous that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been able to convince from the amniotic fluid, i.e. by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as has been demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high fluctuation range of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts have been made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Possibly, the detection of cytokines from the cervix of the pregnant woman by PCR technique is a viable way for the future.
The load of the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured while sitting than while standing.
There is therefore little reason not to allow patients in whom the spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to get up.
Due to the additional ventral stabilization with bone chips, the load on the bisegmental implants was often significantly changed.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher after ventral stabilization than before.
The implant load was not reduced by a corset or bodice.
It is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a corset after a mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningioma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to designate meningiomas with an increased tendency to recurrence compared to usual meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis seems to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We were looking for further prognostically relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined core area-related Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 degrees (N = 160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the "recurrence"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a slightly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitosis figures were found as optional.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, in 50% of cases had a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-).
We were able to show histochemically that the tissue-nonspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is at 1p, can be used as a progression- and recurrence-associated marker enzyme in meningiomas (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and may give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose the name of intermediate-type meningiomas for this group of relatively recurrence-prone tumors located between the usual and anaplastic meningiomas.
The articular process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures due to the special anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment exists for severely dislocated or dislocated fractures.
Preauricular, sub- and perimandibular, retromandibular and oral access have been established as the operative access.
Only functionally stable methods, such as the mini-plate or tension screw, should be used to fix the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT in comparison to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with mainly focal liver lesions before possible liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing cerebrospinal fluid Fowleri (Fowler's);
in addition, a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was diagnosed as a secondary finding.
Background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely insufficiently represented in the basic health services established there.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary Health care system with regard to the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term results after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) inside and outside a single hospital of the main care.
The PhotoDermVL enables a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasias, Nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast carcinoma metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor of women.
The aim of the investigation was to determine the incidence, the identification of risk factors with regard to the occurrence and the evaluation of the benefits of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute relapse.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms of the course are often difficult to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acute exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which were almost impossible to control even with the administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
In addition to the immunosuppression performed, both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins.
In both cases, the originally high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) were able to be eliminated up to minimal maintenance therapy.
After each 9 cycles of therapy, the patients remained free of symptoms during the follow-up period of 1 year under minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is thus one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light (340-450 nm, Max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigmentary changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under wood light by the addition of fluorescent markers has been used in the application control of topicals.
Endocardial mapping is possible in the case of induction of hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms within the framework of programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of circular excitation by stimulation maneuvers ("entrainment mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In the case of clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, an acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases due to high-frequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is significantly lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a recurrence must be expected.
With incessant ("incessant") ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator, there is an indication for early catheter ablation.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a therapeutic procedure complementary to drug treatment and implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.
It is to be expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1. 1. 1985 to 31. 12. 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was studied retrospectively in 386 patients with a rectal carcinoma in the UICC stage I-III after conventional surgical interventions and R0 resection of the tumor.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant relationship between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, and with it a significant increase in the UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and the pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could be detected only for the UICC stage I and II.
In the overall condition and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stage I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of a more accurate tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other factors that can be influenced surgically, in particular the total mesorectal excision for the development of locoregional recurrence.
Uniform standards for the documentation of findings have so far been lacking in echocardiography.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in developed countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most common infectious disease leading to death worldwide.
In developed countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, especially due to the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring, which manifests itself on the skin and mucous membrane.
Eye involvement is present in about 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The discovery of these abscesses by means of echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16) described.
Although, as with other diseases, asymptomatic courses are also known in endocarditis (18, 19, 20, 21), however, no clinical asymptomatic abscesses have yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its first description is increasingly also touching areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, the IL-7 stands out in particular in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear as an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to be able to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
In this overview, molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for possible applications of the IL-7 in dermatology are to be outlined.
It was investigated whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, omniscan) is suitable for contrast-assisted magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose make it possible to assess the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of the reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research trends with relevance for everyday competence are outlined in a first part:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlinks aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with an increase in the total treatment time of fractional radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
By a targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment, significant advances in radiation oncology could therefore possibly be achieved.
In a short overview, the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is of scientific interest, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only currently reliable method is to carry out radiation therapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory reaction probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour after admission and in the interval of 4-24h with regard to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were observed for the primary endpoint of death or re-acute coronary syndrome up to 6 weeks after discharge.Showing results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression with regard to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (in each case after 4-24h), age, gender and diagnosis revealed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1µg /L, p = 0.048, odds ratio = 7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg /dL, p = 0.026, odds ratio = 5.3).
Sensitivity /specificity for the diagnosis of AMI were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24h course, respectively.Conclusions:
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little help for acute infarction diagnostics.
However, the assessment of the prognosis of patients by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4-24h after admission and thus significantly improved.
A 51/2-year-old girl with an optic glioma and the resulting hydrocephalus internus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the ascitic fluid.
For the first time, a disturbance of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier was found to be the cause of the increased cerebrospinal fluid protein by means of cerebrospinal fluid electrophoresis.
The ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, in the case of liver damage with portal hypertension, the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion-requiring conduit bleeding is increased.
While the diagnosis is simple, different therapy options are available.
In most cases, the source of bleeding lies in varices-like dilated vessels in the stoma, so that a local sclerosing with 3% ethoxysclerol or the ligation of the bleeding vessel is appropriate.
Resection of the varicentric conduit portion is an option in case of life-threatening bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequently recurring bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of every bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogens and tumor suppressor genes - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterized solid tumors:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known in a species-specific manner, which are associated with clinical parameters such as, for example, the tendency of meningiomas to recur or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression, which is particularly typical for gliomas and results in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also determined iatrogenically by radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented herself with increasing dyspnea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) 6 years earlier due to mitral stenosis III.
3 Years later, a valve thrombosis occurred, which required a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly better understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial dressing due to loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, as well as by entering the blood or lymphatic system, respectively.
Intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenic factors, which can lead to degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis are other important steps in the metastasis process.
Moreover, when a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will survive only if it escapes the immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cellular system with multiple functional and nonfunctional manifestations in parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is believed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes, the allelic loss of which provokes the development of neoplasms.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 is most often manifested between the ages of 20 and 35, mainly by hyperparathyroidism and /or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies were concerned with the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different methods of preserving donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, since, despite the dynamic cell loss that has been known for a long time, very variable follow-up intervals were summarized.
The aim of this investigation was to carry out a long-term endothelial examination on the same dates, taking into account 2 different preservation techniques.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a perioperative thromboembolism risk of varying degrees, which requires continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective procedures, the administration of coumarin is stopped preoperatively for 2-3 days, in emergency procedures there is a need for vitamin K or Fresh frozen plasma substitution.
Operations in patients undergoing heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less problematic, since the heparin effect subsides within a few hours upon discontinuation.
Results from various epidemiological studies on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany are available.
When transferring the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany, there are estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by a representative survey of physician groups that are relevant for the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of opportunity to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent merging of the results of the survey of the individual physician groups revealed a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of the population estimated by Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "MS in question" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
In order to achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which as a result increasingly produce growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be regarded as a new promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, the clinical application of which can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the general practitioner.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of crucial importance for diagnosis and therapy.
While in the 70s the doctor's conversational style was considered as a personality variant, recent empirical studies on doctor-patient conversation suggest that the doctor's conversational behavior should be understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior with each other.
Training programs to improve primary care psychosomatic basic competence often show little success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the center of the Düsseldorf training and education program for psychosomatic primary care.
The training concept and experiences with it will be presented and discussed in conclusion.
To date, data on the prognosis of heart failure have been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies, as well as clinical intervention studies.
All these sources can only be transferred to a limited extent to everyday clinical practice.
The programming of the speech processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in young children, especially the determination of the stimulation strength corresponding to the maximum acceptable volume (TIMES), is often difficult.
It is absolutely necessary to avoid overstimulation, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex(SR)thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds determined during the postoperative speech processor setting in 27 wearers of three different implant types.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold provides an applicable, objective instrument for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean TIMES was calculated as percentiles of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds sometimes showed large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometric method.
Thus, a safe and simple mathematical determination of the MAL and the hearing threshold was not possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative function check, can contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be examined.
However, the exact TIMES will have to be determined in a different, preliminary behavioral audiometric way.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red parts of a multi-colored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction impressed, which could be distinguished from a true lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate is possibly a consequence of dermal-allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
Therapy of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the area of the kidney by means of rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a surplus mammary gland had developed in the left anterior axillary line during 8 years, which was the size of a chicken's egg and bulged out the skin without buds or areola.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complications as well as the applied therapy are described.
Before and after endoprosthetic operations, a vascular status of the extremities should be assessed.
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency to subjective certainty, which, as an object of psychiatric experience, lose the alienating character with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations, from which delusion arises, are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure of actualization, which weighs on the imaginations and is increased in psychotic constitutions, is a precondition for madness.
To this must be added the failure of the de-actualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by casuistry, starting from the initial stages of schizophrenic insanity, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor, as a rule, occurs singularly and is a benign tumor that was first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing obstruction due to a thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was revealed in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed on the basis of an overview of the relevant literature.
The therapy of choice consists in a complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore present examination options for finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers using color-coded duplex ultrasonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that the presentation was possible in all examined subjects (n=10).
By way of example, it is also shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this order of magnitude can be detected by the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for re-implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with battery depletion of the pulse generator and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the period of operation of the first implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems allows performing operations on the mitral valve via a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Traumas, endocrine and genetic factors play a role in the cause.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the parts of the extremities close to the trunk.
By combining various imaging methods, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor, the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few.
If surgical resection had a monopoly position in previous years, adjuvant therapy measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.
Mutiling interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are justified only in the occurrence of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response of topical therapy or to achieve remission in treatment-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
An exacerbation can often be successfully countered by phototherapy, in particular by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or represents a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented himself for clarification in the ENT department of the BwK Ulm with an aqueous nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-emphasized nasal breathing obstruction.
The clinical examination as well as the CT of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently started from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected via a midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological work-up revealed the diagnosis of a neurinoma.
Based on this case study and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor is presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversially assessed method of treatment of lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, although complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical methods of therapy of lumbar disc prolapse, they sometimes lead to significant impairments.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhages, and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account in the indication of chemonucleolysis and in the education of patients.
Six patients with Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully cryosurgically treated.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low-stress treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapeutic alternative to systemic treatment with dapsone.
Based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counselling/ liaison services, the effectiveness of a psychosomatic-dermatological counselling activity was examined in more detail for the first time in the present study.
The extent of compliance after treatment recommendation was recorded and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as the frequency of conversation contacts, preconception and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was checked.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of a total of n =69 patients with a recommendation for action, there was a compliance rate of 78.3%, based on the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation, a rate of 69%.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of conversation contacts have any influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was conducted.
A positive attitude towards the consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had a positive effect on compliance.
Overall, a high level of effectiveness could therefore be achieved with relatively little time and effort.
It is reported about a 29-year-old patient with an unusual pigmentation of the face.
In the clinical aspect, the pigmentary lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus, in histological diagnostics it was possible to confirm the existence of multiple blue nevi, in addition, there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component, as well as dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed an expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus turns out to be the unusual combination of a lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and a dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo a vascular surgical operation often require far more fluid intraoperatively than is to be expected due to preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid losses and ventilation.
Changes in the Starling forces - in particular the vascular permeability - may play a role here, without these having been studied in more detail so far.
The discussion about the results of the open surgical procedures on the spine, in particular about surgery-related complications, e.g. the so-called postdiscotomy syndrome, has led in the past to the fact that less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, have been sought and used.
The percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal intervertebral disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 70s.
The results of patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results, depending on the author and the study.
It is striking here that the prospective randomized studies that have comparison groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here, the results of the intradiscal treatment procedures are more often assessed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers, but cannot withstand hard scientific criteria of the study design well.
Overall, it should be noted that the percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a partial area of lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At the present time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures have to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their significance when applied after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU range from 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% in each case.
The hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems was able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all of them have documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is mainly due to the removal of the sluice immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by reducing the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula from the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been removing the internal limitans membrane (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina for some time.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and prim‰r dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, nondiagnostic first electrocardiogram, a Pr‰hospitalization time of >= 12 h or an unknown Pr‰hospitalization time.
In order to describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and Prim‰r dilatation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
A drug addict who died of fulminant viral hepatitis in the hepatic coma 5 days after the appearance of the first symptoms.
Serological diagnostics revealed cured hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C, as well as superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis only detected postmortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (over days) in the pulmonary artery with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
The Tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementias of a different cause and 36 cognitively inconspicuous control subjects.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were at a very mild stage of the disease (the total value in the mini-mental state test was 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these subjects compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was found in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer's patients, there was no quantitative relationship between the increase in Tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit, determined with SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau could also be elevated in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients who suffered from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustular dermatitis, especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically impressed subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophil pustulations.
The present work describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosing remains a significant problem after reconstructive vascular interventions.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as the underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival time of intimate cells with the consequence of cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples of 25 primary and 14 restenosis lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were obtained by TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with Re- than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As an essential finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, in particular smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In contrast, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data point to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying cell death form with differences between both lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism that leads to intimate hyperplasia, as usually detectable in human restenoses after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas, which can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
about cytotoxic lymphocytes follows a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is to be assumed at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been increasing continuously for years.
The prognosis is essentially dependent on a rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the usually diagnostically groundbreaking clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis require either the termination of an untargeted antibiotic therapy and verification of the blood culture techniques used, or the use of serological / molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potentiating toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg / ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, emboli are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolisms are not a contraindication to surgery with the heart-lung machine if a primary cerebral hemorrhage has been excluded by means of a cranial computed tomogram and the operation is performed at an early stage before the formation of a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
In addition, a significant improvement in the prognosis due to early surgical intervention has been proven for disease courses that are complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially in the wake of acute valvular insufficiency), by the occurrence of acute renal failure, an infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral sail or sepsis that persists for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, since the large, "cystic" cerebral ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
But sonoembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections, in which one finds either an increased or a decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
With the Infection Protection Act, the system of notifiable diseases in Germany is put on a new basis.
Both certain clinical pictures are subject to reporting in case of suspicion, illness or death (mainly by doctors) and the laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by those who are obliged to report with the notification.
It also determines which information from this may be transmitted further by the health authority.
In particular, in the case of reports of suspicion or when reporting evidence of pathogens, not all the information required to be transmitted will always already be available through the notification, therefore the health authority must carry out investigations itself in these cases in order to be able to transmit the corresponding information.
The health authorities also have the task of merging the incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and transmitting them further as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this.The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information required for transmission.
The transmission to the RKI then takes place via the responsible state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died as a result of a malignant disease in 1998.
Cancer sufferers usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological functional disorders, which lead to a significant loss of quality of life in the case of insufficient or absent treatment.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for adequate pain therapy from various organizations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases lead to reduced values of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis by laboratory analysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of hemostasis disorder.
If this labile condition is further disturbed by various noxes, bleeding usually occurs clinically with a more or less consumption coagulopathy- or hyperfibrinolysis-like constellation of findings and thromboembolism only exceptionally.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after suture-free corneal cataract surgery.
As part of fall prevention, a routine check of the medication is required, among other things.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over the age of 75, it was examined how often drugs are prescribed that may increase the risk of falling due to the possible triggering of dizziness.
Between the individual heart centers, the amount of bleeding differs up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and, as a result, the rate of transfusion of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
By avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, the use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol, the use of allogeneic transfusions is reduced.
Perioperative preservation and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at the European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
The oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with persistent commitment and great efforts.
The UEMS section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for the discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to her work, today, at the end of the 20th century, maxillofacial surgery is recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, the introduction of fungi into the middle ear can lead to serious complications.
Therefore, especially preoperatively, it is absolutely necessary to sanitize the external auditory canal.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparison solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for intravenous infusion, as well as Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical interventions on the eye, were checked for their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The median age was 64 +/- 9 Years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As an underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14 %.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57%, resuscitation in ventricular fibrillation survived in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients, an AV sequential or two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
A subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted in 25 patients and an epicardial patch system was implanted in 2 patients, the implantation site was abdominal in 92 patients and pectoral in 248 patients.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in 33 patients (9.7%) over the course of the study.
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications was three times higher for two-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 12% than for single-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 4% (p = 0.05).
In more than half of the patients (55%), the diagnosis was made primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, in a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain) and in a fifth (21%) on the basis of electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not rotate an X-ray tube mechanically around the patient, but an electron beam is directed onto targets arranged semi-circularly around the patient, at which the actual X-ray radiation is then generated.
With this ultrafast technique, it has become possible to generate axial sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely image all the structures of the heart with a spatial resolution of < 0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered sectional images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in a short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary lime with EBT must be regarded as the currently most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis, including its early forms.
The method is especially suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method can be seen under the condition of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artifacts, as well as superposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive representations of coronary arteries have already become possible with EBT to date, which may still be optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has established itself as the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established method of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for examining this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a consistent examination result was found in a high proportion of patients compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic proportion in accordance with the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, there is a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial current bed in the form of an increased diastolic flow proportion.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography postoperatively in the assessment of the revascularization result.
With regard to the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
In particular, male hypertonic patients over the age of 60 years are affected by dissections of peripheral arteries, which characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a pronounced rarity.
Here, young patients with or without a history of immediate trauma predominate.
On the basis of a case of traumatic dissection of the cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The article shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adaptation of old people's and nursing homes.
The adaptation is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, to profile their core competencies and to accelerate the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, rather it is the task of the management bodies to develop and enforce home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
It is reported about a phenotypically female newborn of the 37th week, who died under the picture of renal insufficiency on the 14th day of life.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic studies ensured the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the end of the 60s, accidents in the Western industrialized nations have been one of the most common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality.
While accidents in older children and adolescents usually occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and infancy that occur preferably during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
There are reported about 2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts, which had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform symptoms.
In both cases, there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of blood enriched with contrast medium through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation, on the other hand by the fact that with conventional techniques only one layer can be imaged per heartbeat.
New developments of both the nuclear magnetic resonance tomographs and the strategies for accelerated image acquisition make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echo planar sequence with preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of the MRI-based determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is enhanced by the variety of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood circulation conditions in the case of ligament ruptures represent an essential parameter, in particular with regard to the chances of success of surgical care, the vascularization of the inner knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The special blood circulation situation was examined by means of microangiography on 21 cadaveric preparations.
This showed a supply of proximally through 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which preferably ran in the ventral ligament portions.
The vascular density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal ligament parts, we would recommend ligament reconstruction by means of fibrin bonding, which allows atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture-related vascular strangulation.
Every year, about 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease (about 75% of all heart operations) are treated surgically in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, predominantly the saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today saphenectomy is mostly performed by means of a continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open dissection of the saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up treatment after coronary surgical interventions and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only slight limitation due to the saphenectomy wound (s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by unilateral malformation in the ventral thoracic wall area with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, mamilla and mamma.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the common occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described to date.
We are reporting on another patient with this rare combined malformation.
In this study, it should be investigated whether sICAM-1 and SE-selectin levels can predict impending sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis at an early stage.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very comprehensive.
However, the online offers of the various magazines and publishers are qualitatively and quantitatively very different.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including low production costs and fast, location- and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but they will be a useful addition to the existing range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grab".
The present case study describes the case of a 52yearold patient who developed a secondary and‰re aortoenteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The pr‰operative diagnosis was made by an upper endoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography.
The value of pr‰operative diagnostics and the 2 alternative operative therapy methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of the PGD, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics in Germany.
Proponents are of the opinion that, from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude a PGD.
Against the background of this situation, a PGD has not been carried out in Germany so far.
The discussion, which has been going on vigorously in Germany for a long time, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Based on case studies, it was to be assumed that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic focus of pus.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective, clinical examination.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined the fever of unclear genesis (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C for at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after a week-long inpatient evaluation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most often by hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
In the present work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
With the help of a fast-curing plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, impressions of the skin are produced that correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent metrological procedure, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
By means of a statistical program, the metrological data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to detect possible improvements in the skin surface texture after using estrogen-containing creams on the face.
Summary The distribution ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the Guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicenter study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in which blood samples are ordered in connection with crimes under the influence of alcohol, an average distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases, the quotient ranged from 1.13 to 1.19. Based on the mean, the deviation of the quotient in 96% of cases is less than 3%.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunting over an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect is typically underlying.
Polymorphic clinical pictures of children that change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement operations are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is possible only through the use of generally accepted evaluation norms.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed after the hospital admission by palpation of the wrist pulses, the clinical assessment of vascularity and by the derivation of the Doppler signal over the wrist arteries.
In the first step, the emergency operations performed on all 10 children included fragment reposition and fixation with crossed K-wires via a stretch-side access.
The subsequent assessment of the blood circulation showed a pulse recurrence in 2 of the 10 children (transient, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
In 8 of the 10 children, the pulse remained absent, which is why the vessel had to be explored in an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we saw a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In adventitial strangulations (2 of these 5 children), pulse conduction at the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective, strangulating tissues.
In the case of intimate injuries (3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patch plasty.
We saw a combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses could be palpated in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal by color duplex sonography, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the brachial artery, radial artery and ulnar artery.
Late ischemic damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not found in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees) and a lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The load-bearing joint axis was normal in all children in a side comparison.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to pediatricians, since the breeding of pathogens succeeds only in 30-60% of whooping cough patients, and the result is available no earlier than after 3-5 days.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--tocopherol acetate/d) against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg/d) was tested in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After a three-week course of treatment, a significant improvement in all the clinical parameters studied was observed both under vitamin E therapy (n=42) and under treatment with diclofenac (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90min to 68min under vitamin E therapy, from 68min to 30min under diclofenac intake.
The joint index according to Ritchie decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac), respectively.
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E group and the diclofenac group.
Similarly, a significant reduction in the severity of pain was observed in both groups, assessed on a 10cm visual analog scale.
The overall opinion of the doctor and the patient on the success of therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even over-inflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary anterior intestinal abnormality.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic pulmonary processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an oesophageal rupture and by Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly fell into severe diabetic ketoacidoses (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol / l, respectively) within a few weeks as part of intoxications with synthetic drugs ("Ecstasy" and "Speed").
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolic state (HbA1c initial 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted in each case under the influence of drugs.
In addition, when the first ketoacidosis manifested, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate hydration.
In addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia, the clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms;
Disturbances of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and delusions of persecution are essentially to be related to drug intoxication.
The therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The courses were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff-cutter prosthesis in aortic position is reported 24 years after implantation.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone-rubber ball of the prosthesis showed a pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, creasing and cracking with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in a terminal prosthesis dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients were treated for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus role on an outpatient arthroscopic basis and monitored according to a standardized protocol at 4 and 12 months.
It turned out that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a conclusion about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although over half of the foci were located in the dorsal sections of the talus roller, these could be achieved without ankle osteotomy, tibial puncture or distraction.
In addition, arthroscopy allows partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes on the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical result make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle joint.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while the latter is already greater in the case of pulmonary edema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
Nevertheless, the mortality from cardiogenic shock, the cause of which can not be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 subjects, cognitive performance disorders were quantitatively detected by using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT) after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam.
The disorders partly corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transient syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia without a tendency to brightening occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident by the detection of a coarse rotational nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after taking midazolam.
Presentation of the state of development and the clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and result distribution and for video conferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a qualitatively very good representation of the extracranial carotid current pathway in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the time-of-flight (TOF) technique, which is preferably used, vessels can be displayed without contrast medium.
The use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables a first-pass representation of the carotids from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s of measurement time with intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
In the present work, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast medium-assisted MRA (CE-MRA), the right time of the amount and flow rate of contrast medium (KM) injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid blood reflux from the venous sinuses into the Vv are the right ones. consider the jugular.
First, the optimal time of data acquisition with regard to the presence of KM in the arteries was determined on a model and in a computer simulation.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By stepwise variation of spatial resolution, measuring time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on test persons and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the field of the extracranial carotid current pathway.
The best qualitative results were achieved using a double-dose technique at 2 ml / s injection speed.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further investigations on the optimal KM application in the still very early state of the art are still pending.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures are the delay of the operation date until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, as well as appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a transplant impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Postoperative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, the early start of a movement program and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of our own clinic, taking into account the mentioned measures, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided.
Within the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical therapy options have essential tasks.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring the outflow of secretions and the reduction of pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination with the integration of all conservative therapy options.
Thus, in many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present work describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for the palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the elderly is one of the most common and least noticed diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or in home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population studied, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% is reported.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as in acute or chronic illness, to energy deficiency and thus combined to general malnutrition.
For accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable tailor-made nutritional therapy.
The most important deficient conditions in the sick elderly concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospitalization, causes enormous health care costs and is accompanied by a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase of the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will become more acute.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention by taking it seriously as an independent disease and integrating it into the curriculum for the training of doctors and nursing staff.
Multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows the ELND as an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor localization and gender of the tumor carrier.
In the stratification according to the forecast parameters mentioned, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, thorax and;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization and with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the arms, legs and abdomen (except for acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further clarified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Applicants for a driver's license are required not only to have adequate eyesight, but also legally to use it "reliably".
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, taking a forced head-gaze posture or using other compensation mechanisms.
However, it is precisely these that are not allowed to him in accordance with the applicable investigation guidelines (Appendix XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated vellus hair in children and young adults.
It is reported about a 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retinated keratin and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be represented histologically by means of warthin starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneously located, in some cases ulcerated nodes.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with a BA, in which there were multiple cutaneous nodes, as well as bony changes.
Under treatment with erythromycin, there was a regression of all symptoms of the disease.
Stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column was performed using thoracoscopic technique in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries.
By increasing experience, the operation times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, the conversion to the open procedure took place in 2 patients.
Our own experience proves the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Significant advantages over the open method are a reduced access morbidity, a reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and a shortened inpatient stay.
Objective of the operation Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with a solid, intramedullary locking medullary nail in a non-drilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for assessing the acromion shape in three-dimensionally reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion form was compared with the classification according to Bigliani in the conventional X-ray image.
Under the concept of primary chronic osteomyelitis, various clinical pictures are combined, which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often caused by bacteria, no pathogen can be detected in the 2nd group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) are prone to recurrence, long course and may additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumors and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There are no histological possibilities to distinguish between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically aging society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of the age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and triggered the search for a consensual and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we succeeded in detecting linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L chains, an early component of the complement C1q and discrete C3 deposits along the obtained elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the stratum papillary, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels in the patient.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extremely exposed in daily use and is therefore also highly exposed to injuries.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most serious injuries, only residual or replacement functions are very often to be gained.
The complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with an acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, a comprehensive first aid is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, an extensive débridement is in the foreground.
The destroyed tissue parts are, as far as possible, primarily reconstructed.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin sheath is replaced by a pedicled or free microchirugic skin flap.
With a long period of ischemia, this concept is abandoned to the extent that blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing result of a complex hand injury, every recovered or created function of the hand counts.
It is therefore not responsible to provide a special department with such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements.
The treatment of symptomatic coronary multi-vascular disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large, randomized studies with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, according to PTCA, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long-term course, according to the BARI study, the lethality in the operated group was lower in diabetic patients.
The individual therapy recommendation by the attending physician has also proven to be an important factor for the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of the newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized studies.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata, which occurred after a period of 4 years after a pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, is reported.
In order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes among themselves and with regard to their relationship to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyzes.
While both diseases had characteristic histological changes as well as a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor could not be secured within both changes.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without reference to the low-malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy specimen and its relationship to the edge of the resectate (R 0 or R 1) must be as exact and unambiguous as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful on breast excises:
1) Radiopaque threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
Upon contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthetic circuit parts, compound A is formed, which could have a nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers with the aim of analyzing the effects of compound A on renal function.
A total of three studies investigated the effects of 8-hour anaesthetics with a sevoflurane concentration of 3 Vol.%, with fresh gas flows of about 2 L / min each being used.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from the renal tubular cells in the urine of the subjects after sevoflurane.
The subsequent investigations then found either no relevant or even no changes at all in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3 Vol.% Sevoflurane which had been administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L / min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In any case, when transferring these results into clinical practice, it is necessary to take into account the experimental nature of the anesthetics carried out in these studies.
Although the topic of low-flow anaesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in the volunteers, as well as the results of new clinical studies, indicate that kidney function after surgical interventions under low-flow conditions behaves similarly to that after isoflurane.
So far, there are no published experiences in the therapy of paraphilias (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in the German-speaking area.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate in a study period of 12 months.
During the treatment period, there were no other sexually aggressive actions and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic procedures seem to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined five different intraoperative warming measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and co-workers first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapuls CO2 laser, a further developed device is available that enables other possible applications in ophthalmology.
Today, the diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is possible both by phlebography and by duplex sonography with an almost 100% certainty.
It is tied to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both methods are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has gained paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific issues, it is impossible to do without phlebography.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two procedures is practiced as a "golden partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
The chronic rejection reaction is the most important unresolved problem of kidney transplantation today.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinilated centromere-specific DNA probes for the human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are mainly composed of T-lymphocytes and macrophages.
in 1991, the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized as one of the methods shortening the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Chamber.
A survey should clarify to what extent Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been made.
400 Questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used in the sense of decision-making aids for determining brain death, and usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The discussion showed that the investigators deliberately communicated borderline situations in which, in some cases, the prerequisites were not fully met.
In none of these cases was the ultrasound examination used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further secure the diagnosis, less often as a sole method that shortens the waiting time.
The microsomal heme oxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32), is exclusively responsible for the endogenous formation of CO.
Therefore, the present work investigated the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerol leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the horny layer lipids into liquid-crystalline states.
Especially when used in O / W emulsion, it improves the horny layer hydration to a considerable extent and significantly above the urea effect.
In addition, it promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus the horny layer shielding.
especially with long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be increased by glycerin.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerin-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O / W emulsions, glycerin also leads to a protective effect against the action of surfactants and against lipophilic pollutants.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerin leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
After all, glycerin, like urea, can lead to an improvement in the penetration of the active substance.
Objective of the operation Objective of the operation Stabilization of the posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by a posterior bone block and capsular plastic surgery.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to extended operating times and the increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptions.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Materials and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multivessel disease underwent complete arterial revascularisation in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic internal arteries, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracic artery and radial artery and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in T-configuration.
On average, the 4,1 +/- 0,9 Coronary vessels anastomosed per patient.
The hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
There were no complications after removal of the radial artery, except for temporary paresthesia.
In the angiographic control 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and the T-Graft technique is a safe procedure for the therapy of coronary multi-vessel disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment procedures for periprosthetic femoral fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has received a key position within neuromonitoring, although the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron cannot be registered directly and only with a time delay due to intracranial pressure.
A prerequisite for a reliable intracranial pressure measurement are specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which are to be investigated below.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functionality and measurement properties.
The partial sphincterectomy is practiced by us in the context of cataract surgery with a very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosing ring of the sphincter pupillae muscle.
While the health-related quality of life of adults has been increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present work, works published in the literature on the topic of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to the main focuses and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work is rare so far, the existing measuring instruments for the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the recording of the quality of life of children in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Due to skin changes, which must be classified as incipient rhinophyma based on the available biographical material, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasio in 1957.
Throughout his entire artistic creative phase, the artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, especially in the nasal area, can be proven.
As a founder of pop art, Warhol has significantly influenced modern society with his complete work and has also influenced our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen), specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and liver living donations.
Experience with the program is available so far for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
Since active nonspecific immunotherapy has had a favourable adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves gene transfer, which can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
Suitable for melanoma:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens by means of peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine ring or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro propagated specific T cells, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of the tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results has not yet been able to be accurately estimated.
In 309 patients treated inpatient with conversational psychotherapy and re-examined one year later, it is shown to what extent raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales can be influenced by defensive postures of the patients measured with validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen test:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to seem inconspicuous-normal.
Their relative improvements (effect strength rating scales) are lower to the extent that their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient conversational psychotherapy strengthened the defenses in aggravating and decreased them in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and then timely surgical therapy of congenital clubfoot, adapted to the severity of the deformity, about 25% of recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentric reduction and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual lump feet (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical procedure is presented.
Beyond the age of 8 to 10, metatarsal osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator and, as an ultima ratio, triplearthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show a pronounced variability of their clinical morphe.
We report about a 77-year-old patient with a pedicled, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-shaped appearance, we propose the expression "Nevus corymbiformis".
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in the transfusion system, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of foreign blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of various procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthetic procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and automated autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, make it possible to spare the transfusion of allogeneic blood even to patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Maternity Hospital and the midwifery school, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He focused his research and teaching on the empirically comprehensible.
His main work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of the pelvic dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis rhombus named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness characterized his research:
He self-critically published medical failures, critically examined new theories.
Thus, he was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis' teaching on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
In 1848, out of desperation about the death of many patients in childbed, which he was partly responsible for, he chose suicide.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-known excitation conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can be used to trigger temporary irritation effects in circumscribed cortex areas in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for application safety are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that usually occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, pregrow after extratemporal and are then noted extracranially as a spatial requirement.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, progressive sensorineural disturbance on the left, as well as mild peripheral facial paralysis without a deficit of lacrimation.
The neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The tumor was removed via an extradural "middle fossa approach" without injury to the motor facial nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the petrosus major nerve without affection of the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) is present when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures, between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, the current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is carried out with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, in case of failure, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
The patient with refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate procedure is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternatively applicable active substances.
For the therapy of an outdated rupture of the tendon of the anterior tibial muscle, either tendon transplantation or tendon transplantation is recommended.
On the basis of a case study, the surgical treatment with an augmented reversal plastic is described;
3 Years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with a good functional result.
The reverse plastic has the advantage that there are no functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies for many clinical pictures.
The analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies, are primarily used to record this parameter in intensive care patients.
On the other hand, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, as diseases that are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with impaired autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The restriction of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be gaining increasing attractiveness in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report about 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the head hair.
The medical history showed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
The examination of the hair by means of atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
Based on our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by the swimming water of our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, Assessment of the global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), Expected or experienced changes according to HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
already 6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of the transplanted found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
The patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and their state of health (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after the transplant, these areas improved significantly, 76% of patients showed a high level of satisfaction with the state of health and 51% with physical performance.
Although the patients already assessed their mental state as good before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 Mon. postop.
Quality of life correlated best with the state of health before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), best with satisfaction with the state of health 6 months after transplantation (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities improved after HTx only in about 28% of patients.
90% suffered from one or more complaints after the transplant, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, all areas of the quality of life with the exception of mental state improve significantly as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite too high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplants are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated craniocerebral trauma (SHT) with a skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma and a contusion hemorrhage after a bicycle fall [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-occupying hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values made a barbiturate coma necessary for 10 days.
Aggravating, the patient developed septic respiratory failure on the 8th day after trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could not be transferred to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive limitation of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 Degree / 10 Degree/20 Degree, Left:
Abduction/ Adduction:
10 Degree/0 Degree/25 Degree, Left:
In the pelvic survey and computed tomography, ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV) were revealed.
The HO were removed two times 2 years after the accident, each time via a Smith-Petersen access.
The prevention of HO recurrence was carried out by means of a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg / day) for 3 months.
The dimensions of movement at the hip joints are as follows 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection, respectively:
20 Degree/0 Degree/30 Degree, Left:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 Degree/ 0 Degree/40 Degree, Left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can engage in light activities as a farmer for 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that codes for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
Using PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes could be amplified, as well as that of some yeast and mold fungi.
By hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides, it was possible to identify dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the demarcation of the dermatophytes from the yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermal samples, as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
In order to evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined using PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected by PCR in 35 and by culture in 28 of the 38 positively evaluated patient samples.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The result of this investigation shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of decisive importance here.
The injuries to the ulnar discus and the scapholunar ligament apparatus are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Over the past decade, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly used in forensic medical practice, in archaeology, as well as in evolutionary and population genetic studies.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special attention to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological investigations is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work with the aim of obtaining mitochondrial DNA from soil-stored teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is the presentation of the findings reported in the literature as well as own observations.
Microperimetric studies after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The operational effort is to be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging the intra-articular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, nativ MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows the direct presentation of labrum lesions by distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences enable the assessment in the crucial cranioventral sections.
With MRA, the labrum lesions can be divided into different, clinically relevant stages.
In addition, the presentation of concomitant lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
In a study conducted by us with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
In the more than 100 arthrographs performed so far, no complications have occurred.
Based on these experiences, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
In this review we present the technique and results of the MRA method we use.
It was found that the variceal wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, this also affected the venous wall below a still intact venous valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in the tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the combination of the mechanical experiments and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and the subsequent varicose remodeling of the vein cannot be confirmed, rather, there is initially a change in the vein wall and thus also valve insufficiency.
Arterial injuries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be absent in the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries.
Hypothenar-Hammer syndrome is a closure of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
In this study, the medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery is to be checked.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance with propofol result in a decreased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anesthesia drugs or techniques.
This article will show how to best take advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in terms of reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice will be discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined maxillofacial surgical-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous upper jaw by a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of endosseous implants is rarely included in the preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was determined in 23 patients on the basis of the preparation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special consideration of anterior aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and /or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to the preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic result achieved.
The profile prognosis with video imaging is a useful decision-making aid in the planning of the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - the extent of the maxillary displacement, the direction of insertion of enosseous implants and the type of supraconstruction.
A large-nodular multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, the unusual clinical and histological aspect of which initially did not allow the diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change of the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, as well as the lack of detection of specific cell organelles, have been able to secure the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations, among others, are offered on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with poor and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as investigations that do not allow a scientifically substantiated statement due to a short study duration and a small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with a sufficient, according to the state of knowledge, positive benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the hepatic artery dextra in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, there had been repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to shock symptoms, the causes of which were difficult to find in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
The superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapy option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke have shown that optimal conditions exist if the early symptoms of stroke are detected quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 hours after the onset of the first symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number can be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The valid standard of treatment in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, as well as the therapy of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
As part of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form with orally administered methadone was compared in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the examination program for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and duration of stay were defined as the target parameters.
With a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg of buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg of methadone, there was a tendency in the retention rate (p= 0.06) in favor of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) tended to be higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
With regard to the additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, there was no significant difference between the two during the course of treatment.
Methadone proved to be the more successful substance in terms of the duration of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and how informative are clinical parameters and locoregional therapeutic failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of occurrence of hematogenous metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined with regard to clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
29 Patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed in accordance with the therapy concept after completed radiotherapy.
10/139 Patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage".
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%) the suffering could be controlled locoregionally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor disease, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time of patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
Remote metastases were detected in 23% (14/62) of patients not controlled by locoregionary, but only in 4/77 (5%) of patients cured by locoregionary (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most often lung metastases, reached a plateau at 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a decisive indication of the likelihood of the development of distant metastases.
Failure of therapy has its cause in the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume detection and location and time resolution in CT is being achieved.
However, the new technical possibilities of the MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current therapy of cross-otter bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive interventions on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
The MPT fixator was applied to 44 patients in the mounting form A and to 23 patients in the mounting form B.
In 4 patients there was a deep infection, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the Lig were followed up. patella in case of caudal debris fractures, as well as 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the lig. patellae in case of tearing and tearing at the lower patellar pole or suture adaptation of the lig. patellae with intraligamentary rupture, in which, except for the extensor apparatus surgery, no other restorations on the knee joint took place.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a strength deficit of the extensor muscles on the operated leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite side.
In summary, it should be noted that the EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven itself in continuity-restoring interventions on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint and represents a powerful alternative to patellotibial fusing with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Nowadays, newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used for the diagnosis of acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies, the benefits of which have been studied in clinical studies.
Based on the case study of a 6-year-old boy, the hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In areas exposed to light, numerous hemorrhagic vesicles appear at the beginning of the light-rich season, recurrently and acutely until adulthood, which heal scar-like.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in using the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central method of recording in the X-ray diagnostics of oral and maxillofacial surgery is panoramic shift recording.
The reduction of the dose requirement has also become possible due to further developments in device technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or imaging plates.
Diagnostic inadequacies of the conventional types of imaging make imaging by means of computed tomography and magnetic resonance tomography indispensable for numerous clinical issues of oral, maxillofacial and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance tomography is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows changes in the cortex to be imaged due to the shortening of the measurement times.
For certain questions, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medical procedures allow an imaging-supported functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is used today in inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are limited in their emotionality or, due to character resistance, are difficult to achieve in verbal psychotherapy.
The most commonly used methods today are given with brief examples, other methods are pointed out.
The factors mentioned as acting factors are, among others, the connection of affects to the vegetative and voluntary nervous system as well as the close connection of psychological and physical processes, which exists especially at the beginning of life, which connects with the respective experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects.
In the further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important significance for therapy.
The relationship of the body-oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Attention is drawn to approaches to empirical research.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and previous experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence the choice of profession and personal life plans.
Although the psychotherapeutic activity gives the individual a lot of leeway to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to realize a family model corresponding to them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects are described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships as to their therapeutic relationships with patients in their education and training.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced heart failure is becoming increasingly important within the group of patients with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the therapy of choice for drug-therapy-refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between the supply and the need for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive list for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical therapeutic approaches have developed.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anticongestively effective beta-blockers.
The surgical therapy of advanced heart failure has been expanded by the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assistance hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastic surgery, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
For this purpose, the preparation of risk scores on the basis of national and international patient registries is necessary.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Bochum, the emergence of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapeutic procedures in the period of one year.
In contrast, there were 122 manual therapeutic procedures performed on the cervical spine, thoracic spine and lumbar spine by the respective ward doctors with completed further training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture (pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar spine syndromes), manual therapy focused primarily on secondary findings in other spinal days in patients with the above-mentioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated mandibular tooth from the place of its attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the documented case of the migration of a retinated lower premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending branch of the lower jaw to the muscular process took place after the end of root growth, after the 20th year of the patient's life.
Neither radiologically nor clinically, there were no concrete causes for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer, as well as cases curatively treatable by means of radical prostatovesiculectomy, is increasing.
The exact pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the stage classification and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no standardized method for processing the preparations internationally, the comparability of various scientific studies is made more difficult.
The precisely defined, rational asservation of the preparations proposed by us is intended to remedy these problems and to help improve the interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood-like increase in the requirements for documentation, performance recording, profitability and quality control, require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
A client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use at the Orthopaedic Clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen since 1992, which has been continuously further developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific requirements of the clinically active doctor have been taken into account in particular.
The application contains the basic functions of patient master data management, surgical planning (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server into MedXS, content and functions can be accessed simultaneously from the intranet or the Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet-ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with the health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by nonspecific neurological symptoms, as well as, in particular, facial dysmorphism signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukoderma (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered relatively typical and mostly trend-setting.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
The therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
In individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM, there is a manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication according to usual therapeutic guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to screen a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that detects alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal level.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of total knee prosthetics is still being discussed very controversially in general.
In this context, there is our need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just in comparison to the prosthetically supplied patella.
The fact that we have been performing patella replacement only in special cases for almost 5 years has made available to us a patient material on which this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 fully prosthetically treated knees documented with a 2-year follow-up, we carried out a survey of the patella lift and tilt, which was targeted first at the natural and then at the prosthetic femoral patella guide bearing, and put the results in relation to the range of motion achieved after 2 years and to persistent pain symptoms.
An adaptation of the bony patella silhouette to the prosthesis sliding bearing was regularly observed with compaction of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous placeholder layer;
7 Patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" based on their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees flexion /extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift above 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt above 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and decreased mobility with a severe preoperative shift were also correlated, also with a significant difference from the problem-free collective.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the patella course (16 mm / 39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After an axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also became free of symptoms and well mobile again, without a surgical procedure having been performed on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
Thus, the conclusion is obvious that a greater effort seems justified for the recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps during implantation that favorably influence the course of the kneecap, a high quadriceps displacement or a medially displaced refixation of the detached tuberosity, for example, may become necessary.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the patella, which is not prosthetically supplied, has an amazing adaptability to the prosthesis sliding bearing by remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative deformity, in which we had not made a replacement due to good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with a normalized patella progression.
Whether there is an extended indication for patella replacement in such cases remains to be seen.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for the external quality assurance measures.
By introducing a comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing hospital structures.
So far, the focus has been on measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment procedures.
In order to increase employee satisfaction and qualification, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
The aim of the operation is to avoid or eliminate compression on the nerve structures.
The present work gives an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland, as well as the liver, there are increased defects of the respiratory chain in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasia is pathogenetically different from oncocytic neoplasia.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas occur preferentially in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
Which molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for this is still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like skin lesions in a patient with long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to the autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes of this patient are also due to a zinc deficiency of the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people will be compared with each other regarding their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The examined skin patients differ significantly from healthy skin in the sense of an impaired sexual life.
The exchange of caresses is in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatic patients feel more impaired compared to patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been approached about their sex life by their attending physician.
However, despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor for skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for issues related to skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
Even today, the conventional X-ray image must still be regarded as a basic examination in the case of a clinical question about inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bony inflammatory destructions, but also allows to assess their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image is able to indicate a clinical relapse situation via the collateral phenomena and to present the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths directly and indirectly.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed representation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR -, offers highly specific information on some special issues, in particular on the stem skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis, partly also for surgical planning.
This applies, among other things, to the iliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
Today, the treatment of open fractures of the lower leg of the II degree and III degree with simultaneous soft tissue damage involves a wide range of operative possibilities of primary osteosynthesis.
Through the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail, up to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue covering.
Only through the associated successes has it been possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the previously high rate of disabling amputations and infections.
If at first it was only individual case observations, then the signs were increasing that more and more of these patients had soft tissue problems on the lower leg, from the recurrent swelling tendency to the ulcer cruris.
On the basis of a clinical examination using vein occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy volunteers, it could be shown that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
Here, degrees of severity of this damage ranging from a simple swelling tendency to the ulcer cruris are recorded, which are becoming more and more important in their clinical relevance with increasing time distance to the accident event.
In order to avoid further, even iatrogenic, damage, strict adherence to the surgical guidelines in primary care is necessary, postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of form and function of the limb.
Muzins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins which have a large number of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and / or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry has provided extensive knowledge about their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, it was possible to describe typical changes in antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues.
A number of recent results also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as a prognostic marker.
The present work provides an overview of the gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including its own findings.
Through the establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany, it has been possible in recent years to achieve a networking of outpatient and inpatient areas with the resident general practitioners, internal medicine and orthopaedic specialist rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists as well as the acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatological control centers can contribute in the long term to further improving the cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatic patients and to ensure a continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatic patients in the sense of a comprehensive rheumatological quality management quantitatively and qualitatively.
Despite the increasing frequency of medical problems, knowledge about the type and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical Chambers of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert committees found treatment errors.
The complaint in 95% concerned the surgeon, in 2% the anesthesiologist, in 3% both disciplines and once an otolaryngologist.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine procedures on the thyroid gland.
Surgical-typical complications such as recurrent paresis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), post-hemorrhage (3%) and late recurrence (1%) together accounted for 63% of the allegations of treatment errors, but only 31% of the confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodes (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of the allegations, but 70% of the treatment errors.
Educational deficiencies were present in only 11% of the detected treatment errors.
The detection of a treatment error was particularly common when a new operation was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001) or when a complication was followed by an error in the follow-up treatment (p < 0.001).
The field of "Environment and Health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes significant problems with obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this area has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications are bilateral kidney tumors, kidney tumors in patients with functional and anatomical individual kidneys, as well as in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Through surgical strategic improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and work-bench surgery - even patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors can be saved to over 95% from a nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving kidney tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are recommending the extension of parenchymal-sparing kidney tumor surgery to a selected group of patients with contralaterally healthy kidneys (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears low.
The prognosis after the manifestation of local recurrences is in most cases infaust.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome, which has so far been described most frequently in small-cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report about 3 patients with CAR in the presence of a breast carcinoma or a carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but above all low-side-effect.
In the following, a patient is reported in whom pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation was observed in the healed psoriasis foci as part of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy of urolithiasis.
Various lithotriptors have been developed with largely the same technical principles.
The current discussion focuses on the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of a recurrence, which further make a corresponding metaphylaxis meaningful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in addition to other forms of therapy are still pending.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), clinically isolated acute corneal calcifications were observed.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted us to the following investigations.
The joint occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and an active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case study, we present the symptomatology, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF severity.
various possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, which were first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, can be prepared on a polyacrylamide gel by means of silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwest German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 people examined (3.57%), the method of investigation chosen here, which takes into account only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
As a rule, Chondropathia patellae does not require arthroscopic clarification.
The following casuistry should prove that exceptions must apply.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a football match.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, nodular, connective tissue-transformed hematoma, which can be easily treated with a :
During the football match, there was obviously a hemorrhage due to a bruise or patellar dislocation.
The boy was symptom-free after the arthroscopy, the muscle atrophy quickly regressed.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented which suggest a more long-term effect (longer than one year).
Recent studies clearly prove a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of inflammation inhibition from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies also provide insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical studies support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes, which are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but to a certain extent develop independently of each other.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms, presented elsewhere on this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and -chains of the 1-, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and interindividual variation as well as different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether the AMS have functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or only represent "biological redundancy" or only the very last binding insurance (final insurance).
The labeling of sperm-AM was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in the seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors with a diverse spectrum of action.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, even levels during the day and an evening rise and night peak between 2.00 and 4.00 o'clock.
In addition, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes independently of a receptor system due to its strong lipophilic properties and to act as a free radical scavenger in the extra- and intracellular space.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly great.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The effect of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There are some findings on the penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medical diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies, on the one hand, in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which can localize a focus of inflammation if the focus is unclear, since the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and the SPECT technique is given, and, on the other hand, in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which, for example, make it possible to prove leukocytic infiltration.
Both method approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which entail an inflammation scintigraphy in case of unclear findings.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treating capillary infant hemangiomas.
Surprisingly, however, detailed studies have so far been lacking that prove their effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends both on the primary, mechanical brain damage, and on the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial space requirement due to post-traumatic hemorrhages and edema formations, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as the causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated SHT and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "system reaction" (SIRS) with the participation of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multiple organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but their combination and accumulation can be fatal.
Hypermetabolic states after a SHT are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism with the participation of the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of a SHT on the rest of the organism are to be contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-related perfusion disorders can cause a prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole body inflammation reaction" affects blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the organism as a whole, as well as the influence of the currently used therapeutic measures are still insufficient and require further clarification.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve life support and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This work attempts to summarize important aspects in this field.
For a better distinction between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for the early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and recently also the human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids.
Children with facial cleft formation have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
The literature data on the incidence of heart defects fluctuate significantly.
46 Psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 full-time participants and examined for striking personality traits.
Furthermore, they were asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for the termination.
As erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin, an early childhood manifest, predominantly hereditary dermatosis with partially circinal reticular erythema was described, especially in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal attachment to the winter half-year and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient that are a good match for erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area were not to be identified.
17 Studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed with regard to their results and their scientific quality.
The vast majority of the reviewed works reveal clear shortcomings.
In this study, it should be examined whether visual acuity decreases as a function of the performance time, and whether normal persons and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the assessment of driving ability.
Sudeck syndrome affects an limb after a microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck's syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory reaction to an injury or surgery of a limb.
His theory did not find supporters, since most of the medical profession holds the view that Sudeck's syndrome is triggered by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, methods for the application of fast multilayer spiral CT for cardiac imaging by means of ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
In addition to the radiological examination procedures commonly used in dentistry, computed tomography enables the superposition-free presentation of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proven itself in other issues.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jawbone and the damage caused by the retinated teeth to permanent teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the retained tooth can be delineated, an orthodontic classification is possible.
In inflammatory dental diseases, it is necessary to accurately determine the horizontal and vertical bone breakdown.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space requirements can be detected with CT.
Before an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
The symptomatology of the SE is described on the basis of case studies.
The leading symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to coma.
As a rule, cranial computed tomography is also normal, generalized cerebral edema may occur.
On the electroencephalogram, a general change is revealed, the magnitude of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defensive reactions of the organism to bacterial products, as well as bacteremia itself, are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors, such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, as well as liver and kidney failure, may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate therapy of sepsis is of decisive prognostic importance, SE is of particular diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition, despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy, has a ‰uflerst poor prognosis.
Movies tell stories.
Particularly exciting are those scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts.
Medical ethical conflicts do not only appear in doctor series or depictions of diseases, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance films, gangster and crime films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and are at the same time seismographs for the social relevance of medical ethical topics.
However, in the film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical-ethical case review and is a helpful addition to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the rate of restenosis compared to conventional PTCA has led to the fact that stent implantation has become the most frequently performed initial intervention.
That is why stent restenosis - especially the long-term form - is a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the rescue services.
It is precisely the first aid for the amputee in amputation injuries that, in addition to the first aid for the injured, often determines the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of imaging diagnostics of the larynx is the analysis of the structures located submucosally, which are not amenable to laryngoscopic assessment.
As a result, the general rule is to perform imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographic-anatomical relationships of the skeleton, internal structures and the environment of the larynx will be presented synoptically.
By means of a transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system, the instability was eliminated with segmental functional preservation.
In recent years, new knowledge has been gained about the post-traumatic changes after craniocerebral trauma (SHT) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological-intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals that are intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in the brain-injured patient.
Within the framework of this work, the more recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the basic pharmacological intervention possibilities will be discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are at different advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with a progressive course of the disease pose a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present work was to examine the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease of treated melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for over 3 years due to pulmonary silicosis, before symptomless blackish spots appeared on the face.
In the other patient, after only 6 months of taking minocycline, there was the appearance of gray-black spots on both lower legs due to folliculitis.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser led to a regression of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed on the basis of the case studies.
Surgical objective Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
In recent years, microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
A significant factor in this is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
Within the framework of this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve was investigated after partial resection and reconstruction with the vascular-stemmed long thoracic nerve.
The sensation of pressure and pain could already be felt 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly pedicled thoracic nerve longus is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in tumor patients.
The intake of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most frequent cause of deliberate overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, in a large number of overdoses, serious complications occur only in a relatively small number.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient in whom the standard dosage has been exceeded and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, a complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be performed in every patient for whom the strength or time of overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function deteriorates.
In the case of the beginning signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in case of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has significantly improved the fate of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the special institutions for liver diseases.
Background and question.
Itching is a difficult to treat concomitant symptom of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the paprika plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
When applied topically, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological clinical picture that is problematic both diagnostically and therapeutically.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as an operative alternative for therapy-refractory testalgia.
12 Patients were treated surgically by spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnostics:
The cremasteric muscle is severed by means of bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of the testicular artery is detached under microsurgical conditions on a length of 2-3 cm.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in the therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained with an exact indication, so that an accurate environmental diagnosis is an indispensable prerequisite for the exclusion of a specific genesis of the testalgia.
The trend in neurosurgery is also towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimize the preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to keep the risk of neurological and mental disorders as low as possible.
Hospitalization and incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
An essential "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, the brain chambers and the subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for a neuroendoscopic procedure is occlusive hydrocephalus.
But also arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular space requirements can be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjuvantly during microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by means of diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
The DW-MRI measures the ADC specific for a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e. diffusion barriers), a low, in low-cell or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is to be expected.
A 53-year-old man had a melanotic lung tumor that had completely closed the left main bronchus and its base was localized in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the lower left lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.
There was no indication in the anamnesis for earlier removal of a skin, mucous membrane or eye change.
The targeted examinations of the skin and the eye also revealed no indication of a primary tumor localized there.
Thus, the neoplasm is to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered to be confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far, there is no experience about twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore examined twilight vision before and after LASIK for the correction of myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for non-invasive diagnosis of ischemia.
With ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacological stress protocols, as currently used in echocardiography, can be performed.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost in the course of organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this is a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has developed into a routine diagnostic technique, which is preferably used in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
In this case, static cytometry (microscope cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry for reasons of lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically flawless technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The obtained parameters, in the 1st line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in the 2nd line also the ploidy, represent prognostically and important factors for therapy planning.
A precise knowledge of the method and the possible errors is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining the proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be regarded as unclear at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric investigations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
In cervical syndromes, injection therapy has a significant place.
On the one hand, this article deals with general requirements and on the other hand with the various practical procedures for injection.
Summary The assumption of the costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by the statutory health insurance is unclear, although the question of the assumption of the costs by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical preventive care (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as the legal basis for the assumption of costs.
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as corresponding recommendations of the federal committees are missing.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon in order to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to bear the costs may come into consideration according to the principles of the legal character of the so-called new examination and treatment methods.
However, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be concretized in terms of indication and method of use and cleared of ambiguities.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, since there are still too many ambiguities from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The previous work investigates the importance of an extended corneal storage time for the success of a perforating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experience with 3-dimensional echocardiography, we tried to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanel studies 3-dimensionally and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation, experienced heterotopic ossifications on 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow, as well as both hip joints, made it possible to achieve a restoration of mobility.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur, in particular, post-traumatic, after injuries of the spinal cord, after SHT, with intoxication and in a long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, a transformation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause the formation of new bone.
The diagnosis is made with the help of the imaging procedures.
Prophylactically, drug treatment can be carried out by means of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), irradiation or a combination of both procedures.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), in which we used the argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that could not be influenced or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After using the argon laser, complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of the treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
Within the framework of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies to HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue Lamivudine is effective, but expensive.
Reinfection for hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
An effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and still requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, after reinfection, the prognosis for the transplant is less favorable, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable with other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study as well as the existing literature.
The therapy of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiation therapy.
An exception are the rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in preexcitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative claim.
Accessory conduction pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentrytachycardias of different incidence, duration and frequency.
The understanding of the tachycardia mechanism and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, the identification of its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitation conduction system and the detection of other paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident diseases of the heart should be evaluated before the intervention by means of echocardiography and, if necessary. be examined with contrast presentation at the beginning of the procedure.
In 300 patients with various variants of pre-excitation syndrome, their own results of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a better qualitative recording of the complication events in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics for years, a standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
Since 1.1.1997, the Stiftung Orthopädische Universitätsklinik Heidelberg has maintained a complete, consented register of all early complications of all inpatients.
According to a standardized nomenclature, the complications are recorded prospectively by the medical profession in a complication program and the information is checked, corrected and supplemented by the quality management department of the clinic and classified.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard in the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the aim of building consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the area of the acres in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, an impairment of dermoepidermal coherence that occurs obligatorily during the course of treatment should be the basis, which is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of bulging blisters.
Acrobullous photodermatosis is to be differentiated by differential diagnosis from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of too high UVA irradiation or too high psoralen concentrations.
Based on two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture is presented.
In addition to autoptically confirmed findings of fibrolipomatous replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
in 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological peculiarities, which have been classified into main and secondary criteria.
On the basis of the subsequent examination on a collective of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the developed criteria is to be checked.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in the sense of main criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography, or echocardiography.
4 Patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetics disorders of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be detected histologically.
T-inversions in right precordial derivatives as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS broadening of more than 110 msec in V1 to V3 could be found in 8 patients (33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis by means of a signal averaging ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of secondary criteria.
Left bundle branch block-like ventricular tachycardia, which were classified as secondary criteria, could be detected in 23 patients (96%;
only one patient died of progressive right heart failure without proven arrhythmias.
An anamnesis of an unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion could be collected in 3 out of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a reliable histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without including histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a purely clinical diagnosis is more likely to be possible by a more favorable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria.
Clear data prove that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia in cerebral ischemia is controversially assessed.
The contradictory results of the clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained if different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood sugar levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia in the presence of insufficient collateral supply.
Further, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in this period is increased.
In contrast, an acute increase in blood sugar by improving the substrate supply can protect nerve tissue from structural damage if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is in the area of the penumbra and with good collateral care.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative as well as the positive effects of acute hyperglycemia are dependent on the local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgical diagnostics, according to which a resective epilepsy surgical intervention was performed in 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies.
The localization correspondence of findings of non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or had seizures only very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if there were circumscribed MRI lesions and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, in particular temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG derivatives are sufficient in pre-surgical diagnostics and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
Anamnesis and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented himself at an out-of-home clinic with a newly appeared tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiographically, the suspicion of an intracardiac space requirement was initially expressed, which should be clarified further by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
On the ecg, tachyarrhythmia absoluta was found with frequencies up to 146 / min, and a sinus rhythm was also documented intermittently.
In the X-ray examination of the thorax, this could also be confirmed as a large spatial requirement in projection onto the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal margin towards the lateral superior.
Due to the suppressive growth of the cyst with the triggering of atrial arrhythmia and for the safe exclusion of malignant degeneration, the cyst was removed surgically by means of anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in sinus rhythm and only complains of isolated "dropouts", most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Atrial arrhythmias that appear to be primarily harmless can also be based on rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intracardiac space requirements that require specific therapy.
An overview of the formation of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cranial nerve paresis can have a variety of causes.
A rare trigger of paresis of one or multiple cranial nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
The early detection of carotid dissection, even with atypical symptomatology, is important, since anticoagulant therapy started on time can prevent a stroke as a result of dissection-related embolism.
We report about 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder's syndrome), as well as the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden cranial nerve failure must also make one think of a carotid dissection.
The incorrect discharge of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic until old age, but can also become clinically manifest even in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on diagnostics and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as on the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis arose by chance in the framework of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted in transplanting the coronary artery failure without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, because of the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joints offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result due to a low, surgically caused soft tissue trauma.
The goal is to achieve at least an exercise stability, even in comparison with the standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the low operative soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative assessment of the articular surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries are of particular advantage compared to conventional methods due to arthroscopy.
From a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures, arthroscopically supported osteosynthesis could be performed in our clinic in the period from September 1993 to January 1998 in 34 patients.
The follow-up examination of a total of 17 patients showed good results overall according to the Lysholm and Delamarter score.
For a selected group of patients, we consider arthroscopically supported minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable even for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, after a moderate craniocerebral trauma, had bilateral hypoglossal palsy without other neurological deficits, which completely regressed clinically within 3 months.
Since it was not possible to detect a skull base fracture in the region of the posterior cranial fossa by computed tomography, we discuss a bilateral distortion of the hypoglossal nerve as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backflow propagates from the large conducting veins through the smallest venules to the area of microcirculation and finally affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features are best suited as the basis of classification principles, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement procedure.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the basis of arteriovenous short-circuit connections.
In the area of the lower extremities, skin changes usually occur unilaterally, reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain, and rarely hypertrophy of the limb in question.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerating nodes with a tendency to bleeding and infection.
Causal therapy consists in the elimination of arteriovenous shunts.
An operative procedure is rarely feasible due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Super-selective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
It is reported about the successful embolization treatment, which has been performed a total of 8 times so far, in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.
Until now, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytosis of the skin was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on the frozen section (CD1a) in addition to the clinic and histology at the H&E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-capable markers now also make it possible to work up (also retrospectively) and classify these diseases precisely on formalin-fixed material.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classical cells of Langerhans cell histiocytoses (LZH) can be differentiated from other histiocytic cell systems.
To date, there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics for the so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LZH).
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes / macrophages and the dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-capable immunohistological markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown on the example of the Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown on the juvenile xanthogranuloma) seem to have diagnostic significance with regard to the differentiation from the Langerhans cell histiocytoses.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epithelioid cells typical for the disease process.
In the following, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of application of allopurinol and after re-exposure to this drug.
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
So far, 7 case reports of non-schistosomiasis-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of an IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma seems to lie in the chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After the conservative treatment options had been exhausted, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"Notox Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for fixing tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autoptically obtained organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological stains and accepted immunohistological stains, in particular for tumor diagnostics, were used.
As a result of these investigations, which were carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was possible to establish that tissue samples fixed with NoToX have no differences whatsoever from formalin-fixed tissue samples with regard to the reproducibility of the conventional dyeings or the visualization of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven itself as a useful substitute for formalin.
To describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the "multiple scan average dose" (MSAD) and the axis dose free in air are usually used.
The CTDI and the MSAD, which can be derived from it, are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient, according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs, and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose, which allows an estimation of the risk.
The indication of an upper guideline value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirement of the examination region in order to ensure an acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities are useful for the characterization and differentiation of various examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
According to a report of the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the definition and Classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory myocardial diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been re-included in this definition.
As a result, a number of infectious pathogens, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpes viruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and dilatation of the ventricles.
It seems reasonable to assign an independent place to shame as a generally human emotion in distinction from guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self-preserving" function of shame should also be considered.
The appearance of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of worth, even if it should not be recognizable in the patient at the moment.
The signal character of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have a disease value is considered.
The attention to psychogenesis and the unconscious dynamics of shame broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very inhomogeneous both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as in terms of professional competence.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder- and event-specific concepts and works on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without an inflammatory reaction, as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis, has been the subject of research in recent years.
Atherosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show an increased number of inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined by immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test for the detection of fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy.
The objectives of this study were the evaluation of possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, detection and quantification of cell death events, as well as the delineation of apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on - according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - specially fixed cadavers, it was examined in which position relation to the balloon the transverse fascia is located and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In the case of the TEP, the fascia can be used at most laterally of the artery as a reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment for fixing the foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin changes.
The detection of numerous mites in the scaly crusts led to the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
It is assumed that the therapy of eczema lasting for months in the sense of immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are being evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions with regard to O2 transport and in particular the effective O2 delivery to the tissue has been proven in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
A certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are well tolerated even in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This was detected under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation, and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative from the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured people.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is based strictly on clear physical laws and defined physiological regularities.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally recognized indications for HBO therapy, in which it is either the only causal, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapeutic component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotraumas of the lungs, the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication should be especially taken into account.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication, as well as the skills and abilities to reliably control complications that occur with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapy character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthesiologist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this work, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique in tumors accessible by sound technology because of its good depth focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive magnetic resonance tomographic temperature measurement can become an important instrument for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
The long-term effects of prematurity on the ophthalmologic and otolaryngological status should be demonstrated in a group of extremely small premature babies.
Since 1993, an EDP system has been used at the orthopedic University Clinic Homburg/Saar for surgical and outpatient documentation as well as to support the general clinic organization.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS- or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the data of 31,500 patients have been recorded in the system and 8,500 operations have been documented.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through further, clinic-wide networking, there is also the possibility of cross-departmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks and the Internet at the University Hospital Homburg.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to check whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupil response.
Attention is also drawn to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of the (mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
In this study on sheep, it should be clarified whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether a temporal assignment results and whether the results suggest a continuation for the use of the GAG as a prognostic criterion or arthrosis marker.
21 Sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups à 7 animals:
The knee joints of the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects serve as controls (n = 54).
The radiological score values between the TD vs. ME and MV groups differ statistically significantly (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, HA shows a significantly increased value in the ME and MV groups.
In the case of CS, a significantly increased level results both for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial separation (p < 0.01).
Clinical consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - possible, to a certain extent, a description of the degree of arthrosis.
The concentration increases with a larger postoperative interval and an increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present itself in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures.
Therapy with blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In case of therapy failure, a pacemaker implantation or an operative sympathetic blockade may be considered as an option.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
The additions and use of an epidiascope are described, which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ discs in the courses of general and special pathology and saves time-consuming video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older age and of far-reaching importance.
These problems are referred here to the instance of the I-ideal and examined from the point of view of the increasing discrepancy between I and I-ideal in old age.
Pathological exacerbations of the aging process, as they are often present in elderly patients, are shown in three aspects.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the Muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility on the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed using the Muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a high success.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chirotherapeutic techniques with impulse.
We are reporting on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, which has been known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhoea and Sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy give a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjogren's syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in the clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be considered as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological clinical pictures.
In developed countries, it is medical conditions rather than lack of food that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the elderly population and occurs in 5-12% of the independently living, in 30-61% of hospitalized and in 40-85% of elderly people placed in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A heightened awareness of the doctor for nutritional problems and a prompt risk assessment are essential prerequisites to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
Statistically significant differences for 12 structural features emerged from the reflected-light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 functional / compound nevi.
digitiform radial spurs, blue-gray reticular patterns, opaque alabaster plaster-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/gray background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific incident light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several individual features that may be suspected of malignancy occurring in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy procedures in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently related vectorial transport systems and strategies for the integration of therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical applicability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) has been transferred are an essential step forward on the way to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment procedure for the correction of hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral administration in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic clinical pictures.
These were 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral hypoplasia of the lower jaw in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Rodent syndrome and 1 rare case of a midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The distraction duration ranged from 6-30 days, whereby a bone gain of 6-28 mm could be achieved.
Older people interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the many opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further education institutions and institutions for the education of the elderly are required to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media competence and to create interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
On the basis of experiences from the information campaign "Senior-Info-Mobil", possibilities are described to pave the way for people over 50 to gain access to the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects, it is further shown how spatially and temporally decoupled 'research-based learning' of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a "new learning culture" that also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or cannot participate in local offers for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods in recent years.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of the simultaneous acquisition of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to the high spatial resolution and reproducibility, Cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only procedure that provides an insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic procedure that offers the complete clarification of heart diseases in one examination both as an initial examination and for follow-up.
Due to the rapidly progressing development, existing restrictions, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and EDP at the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg will be given.
Since its foundation in 1967, 4 development phases can be distinguished:
initial medical initiatives, establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of the performance process.
Planning and realization were carried out in compliance with the framework plans and concepts of the University Hospital of the State of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of an extracorporeal cardiac pressure massage.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyema and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium.
The cause must be assumed to be contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment consisted in resection of the inflamed section of the vessel with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem of a six-year-old boy with a one-sided type II cleft foot with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current state of the controversy surrounding the indication for the back surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described as well as design-technical features of the various implant types and peculiarities of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the topic of patellar posterior surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it will be discussed why the indication for back surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patellar back surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes of the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear to date.
In particular, a chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is often observed after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensive drugs cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
There are hardly any studies on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" characterizes the absence of visible signs of fracture in the conventional radiography performed for the initial diagnosis, with a fracture still present.
The diagnosis is only successful in the course or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations performed for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a procedure is available that allows both the early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and the diagnosis of any chondral and ligamentous concomitant injuries.
In the present study, we report about 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, in which the diagnosis could be made with MRI if the X-ray result was negative.
Athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon described at an early stage.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small end-stream arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the very variable clinical picture and the diagnosis, which can only be confirmed invasively or post mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical interventions or catheterization of the aorta.
Anticoagulants proved to be effective in patients with a special variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with pedicled and mobile thrombi emanating from circumscribed plaques.
Embolization episodes could be prevented and regression of the thrombi could be observed.
A 62-year-old patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and extensor inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar femoral fracture is reported, who had been treated osteosynthetically by means of a dynamic condylar screw 2 years ago.
Here, the indication was given for a varying and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis by means of a retrograde femoral nail.
The patient was able to fully load the right lower limb within the 1st postoperative week with the axis compensation completed.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method for achieving good and load-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective operations.
Tear duct operations at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from the years 1987 - 1992 were examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloid, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspicious, but they themselves do not prove carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nuclear size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasm changes) must always be evaluated in comparison with pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically assessed in any case and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (in the case of positive detection of basal cells) safely rule it out.
In this review, the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their significance for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, a maintenance therapy of 14-20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. was compared with a monthly administration of 50mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an inital dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters already one day after the first administration.
Subsequently, despite the further administration of the test substance, there was an increase in the inflammation parameters.
At the same time, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
It is reported about a 13-month-old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested the suspicion of a vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care, so that any disruption of postnatal adaptation is detected in a timely manner.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods, such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are performed in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aquajogging is used as a regeneration training and as a "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and in the endurance area.
In rehabilitation, aquajogging is excellently suited for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative period for diseases of the musculoskeletal system, as well as endurance and light strength training for internal medicine diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are of a vascular surgical or prosthetic nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery is the only causal therapy that has its place in a selected group of patients.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to about 53-55%, contrary to initial short-term results.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success (on average less than 40%).
Penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term survival rates of the implants and a patient satisfaction of 89%.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapy option to the last place of the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations can occur with 5-year implant survival rates of between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbus grafts, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our now 3-year experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly reduces the nocturia frequency, while the frequency of urination remained unchanged during the day in a controlled study.
Heparin also reduced the frequency of nocturia in an open prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are practically free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of web sites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, with a competition with commercial offers has arisen.
After the first experiences, the task today is to critically evaluate the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after a sudden infant death ("sudden infant death", SID).
In the following, we report from a psychiatric and forensic medical point of view about 2 cases in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID and accused themselves of killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents will be communicated.
The review of the cases of 110 children admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu with Burkitt's Lymphoma within a period of 7 years showed a preponderance of male versus female patients (1,9 :
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that an interrelation between infections caused by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses, as well as malnutrition, could play a role in the etiology of the tumor.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective for initiating the regression of the disease, but is better than the single agent in the prevention of systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of the patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has been a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Zwickau surgery provided important impulses for general and local anaesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organisation as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures.
After a short literature review, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have been little described so far in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the background of early fears of abandonment, there is a renewed threat of being dropped as part of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which previously served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance that, however, can trigger pustular dermatitis as an undesirable effect, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report on the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after the use of a mistakenly 50-fold too highly concentrated dithranol preparation of the magistral formula in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascul‰ren hypertension is of particular importance, as it is a secondary form of hypertension that can be successfully treated and partly cured by interventional radiological or surgical interventions in many cases.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be studied.
An andrological patient is reported, in whom the initial examination led to the detection of a high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicular size, which is significantly below the normal range, spoke for a pronounced testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery period under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E and the trace element zinc, there was a significant improvement in spermiogram.
After another 2 months, intrauterine insemination made it possible to achieve pregnancy with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At that time, only a slight degree of teratozoospermia was found in the patient.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy in systemic therapy with corticosteroids are to be described.
The X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication today in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy, in addition to ultrasonography.
The legs of the toddler are to be held in the middle position.
Lateral rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
A look back at 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which most recently took a backward development into the 19th century in the "open approach" with the opening of the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
a sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnostics of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest X-ray is in the first place.
Profound knowledge of the normal thoracic picture and the possible physiological peripartum changes are a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatological thoracic picture.
Childhood pathologies:
A large number of congenital and acquired changes that the radiologist is faced with in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnostics of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect the quality of life in his further life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the paediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the main pathologies that the radiologist may face in the daily routine.
The primary tumors were breast carcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcomas (n = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanomas (n = 9), gastric carcinomas (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (n = 6 in each case) and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor infestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, in the 120 initial resections, an extrahepatic tumor was present in 51% (n = 61).
Of the 120 initial resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0 resections, 13 (11%) as R1 resections and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
The median overall survival was 20 months after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After second resection (n = 14), there was a median survival of 28 months for all patients and of 41 months after R0 resection.
In the patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the initial resection of the liver, the median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and after R1/2 resection was 7 months.
The present results show that resection of noncolorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also definitely promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences can even benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, even with a rather unfavorably assessed initial situation, impressive long-term trends could be observed.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man has been charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed about the act alien to the personality, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communicans artery.
For the assessment of the culpability, this course in connection with the testified behavioral abnormalities shortly before the crime therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be considered.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself, among other things, for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated into the vitreous body.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is flushed up and can be repositioned to the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be refixed, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
It is unclear what kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL.
Since a biotoxicity of the PFCL is likely with prolonged intraocular retention, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of the operation.
The rare case of solitary subcutaneous cutaneous metastasis of a chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year postoperative interval without any appearance.
In the course of further investigations, no metastases that could be detected by clinical apparatus were found.
Nevertheless, taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental anomalies of the pancreas are due to the embryonic development of the organ and are caused by a malfusion (pancreas divisum) or a malrotation (pancreas annulare) of the two appendages.
Pancreatic divisum and pancreatic anulare can ultimately only be secured by a duct representation of the pancreatic duct.
In the case of congenital diseases, there are genetic defects, in which other organ systems are usually involved and in which the extrapancreatic damage is usually in the foreground of the clinical pictures.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes of the organ, which can be detected with modern imaging methods.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
On the basis of the panel work by Bärensprung and Hebra, it is explained that at a second glance they also reveal some other facts relevant to medical history.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/ defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report on unusual findings in late-presented congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel chest and a fatal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The informative value of ultrasonography in bacterial coxitis was checked.
259 Children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were sonographically examined.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the femoral head surface and the periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard sectional planes of the DEGUM.
An intra-articular space requirement (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule withdrawal was detected sonographically in bacterial coxitis, fugax coxitis, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and in the early stage of Perthes' disease.
Since the joint capsule distension has no significant differences in the individual diseases, a differentiation of these diseases is not possible due to the sonogram in the presence of a capsule distension without bony changes.
A bacterial coxitis can thus not be reliably differentiated sonographically from coxitides of other genesis;
capsule distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
If there is a clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, an immediate diagnostic puncture, if necessary under sonographic control, is required.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to capsule distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes' disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be sonographically distinguished from both bacterial coxitis and coxitides of other etiologies.
The diagnosis of rare cerebri gliomatosis can only be made by combining clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since there were unusually highly dedifferentiated tumor cells for gliomatosis cerebri in both cases, the diagnosis was made more difficult by atypical findings such as contrast medium absorption on MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to reach conclusions about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the use of complex statistical methods, but that in this sense good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
A possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has so far been evaluated differently.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost ignored in investigations.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with atherosclerotic-related, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenoses were treated by means of transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
In one case, a thrombendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with deep aplasty was performed simultaneously, in another case, an angioplasty with stent implantation of the common iliac artery was performed.
The technical and clinical success was given in all cases.
There was no occlusion or clinical restenosis during an observation period of a median of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation in segmental abdominal aortic stenoses is a low-invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
In short, it is reported about a patient who underwent several years of sterility treatment and became pregnant, although she actually did not want a child.
The different species of aspergillus occur ubiquitously as pathogens.
In the past, Aspergillus flavus was classified as rather apathogenic to humans.
The case of a 72-year-old patient is described in which Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in the tracheal secretion after an aortocoronary bypass operation in the intensive care unit.
The performed serological test procedures, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal-antibodies covered latex particles, were negative several times.
A postmortem aspergillus test using a newer method, antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiographic findings.
The patient died before the use of antifungal therapy, the autopsy showed a disseminated mycosis of both lungs by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of a more sensitive antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
By correctly assessing the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even with a single cultural detection of aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
The epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in developed countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without the histological detection of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high rate of perforation in young children and old people shows the low diagnostic certainty.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow to draw a definite conclusion about the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After refractive interventions on the cornea and after cataract operations, ocular image defects (aberrations) may occur, which cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal-related visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image defects under clinical conditions would be a first important step towards the documentation and correction of these aberrations by means of modern photorefractive methods.
So far, only static unidirectional tensile stress tests have been carried out experimentally for both methods.
Ecke and Hofmann thus came to the conclusion that a comparable stability can be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that this stability should be preferred to their ankylosing for prophylaxis because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis.
By simultaneous-multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations by means of DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire traction belts and PDS banding were comparatively tested.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire traction belting nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, whereby these methods already allowed a symphysis mobility reaching beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, the instability was intensified by cutting the cerclages and bandings into the bone or breaking the wire cerclages in general to the point of complete failure.
In the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchoring.
With the primary over-turning tendency of the screws, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic loading.
With primarily stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable to the full extent over 55,500 load changes with a load corresponding to half the average body weight.
For clinical use, it can be deduced from these results that neither the bridging traction belt with wire cerclagen nor the PDS banding stabilize the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for early postoperative mobilization under partial stress.
If a reliable stabilization of the ruptured symphysis can primarily be achieved with the DC plate or the reconstruction plate by good anchoring of the screws in the non- osteoporotic bone, the injured person with "open book injury" can be mobilized with partial loading corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted with good success for years.
Due to the light distribution to several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects due to capsular fibrosis may lead to visual impairment at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm tall, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumor was initially misidentified as a primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
A duodenal leiomyosarcoma measuring 7 cm was discovered and resected by duodenopancreatectomy only in the course of an anemic evaluation carried out 17 months later.
The re-assessment of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later from an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor condition as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
Drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local administration of pharmaceuticals.
The only approved oral substance with proven efficacy at the moment is yohimbine, a centrally active alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with a central point of attack are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine having a significantly better effect than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
For local application, both the intraurethral (MUSE) and the intracavernous mode of application are available.
At the present time, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely supplanted other pharmaceuticals as the substance used.
Currently, several promising substances with a wide variety of active approaches and different dosage forms are under development as a therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the state of consciousness of the patient, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, as it is especially important for severely disturbed patients, who are not sufficiently reachable by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is a growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemo-, radiation- and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a large number of different strategies summarized under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients experience a time-limited stabilization of the disease, which in some cases also lasts for years.
These are mainly the results of uncontrolled Phase II studies.
As a rule, cures are not to be expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved on selected patient collectives.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapied patients over non- or chemotherapied ones.
A survival advantage for patients with objective remissions is assured.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even under the assumption of a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of the current therapy protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in the currently achievable remission rates and the survival advantage for immunotherapied patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], let's consider immunotherapy as an essential component in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
As a rule, its use should be carried out within the framework of clinical studies.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half each 44,4 +/- 0,9 and 63,0 +/- 0,9 Years old) and 239 women (half each 44,4 +/- 0,9 and 62,8 +/- 0,8 Years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
Alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides are included in the calculation of the index.
Significant correlations between the laboratory indices and biological age are revealed only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
Among them are alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL quotient, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered by chance during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal irrigation fluid.
These findings are likely to be due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and localizations of the primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type will be discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft, it was initially hoped that this procedure would provide advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopically and 14 openly operated patients were examined, respectively preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The score systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligamentary stability (KT-1000), the duration of the operation and the proprioception were measured on the basis of the angle reproduction test.
The energy dose of spiral computed tomography and the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area with the help of thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube performance recommended by the manufacturer of the computed tomograph for a dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid gland) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the ray path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid gland) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy in this case was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by about 76% had no effect on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the CT scans, which were dose-reduced by 76%, are still on average a factor of 10 higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with the suspected clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, makes it possible to divide it into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected using histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques.
It was only by combining histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques that it was possible to conduct a subgroup analysis regarding the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison with patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic / postoperative), it is possible to distinguish bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which, unlike the others, manifests itself preferentially on the clavicle.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis, which we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as casuistics.
In terms of differential diagnosis, the primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be taken into account despite its rare occurrence, since it is a domain of conservative drug therapy - after bioptic diagnostic confirmation.
Exogenous endophthalmitis caused by infection is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
The paper uses a literature analysis to investigate the role of the total treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses as well as, above all, well-designed clinical studies can make progress in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases possible.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules and thereby alters cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
In this paper, the in vitro and in vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in vivo application.
Based on staining of the cytoskeleton and electron-optically, the paclitaxel effect was detected in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and expansion of the vessel diameter compared to balloon dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in the vascular contraction force after paclitaxel administration could be shown.
In addition to an age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplamsa and basal membranes of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), a splitting of the Bruch's membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer is revealed in various forms of manifestation of early and late AMD such as druses, choroidal neovascularization and pigment epithelial lifting.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus is detectable.
Recent studies make it clear that the vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis arise as a result of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptomatology of rheumatic flexor tendon disease of the hand depending on the location of the lesion and the type of visual affect, in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnostics.
For the majority of common dermatoses, too, there is a lack of suitable animal models that occur in nature.
The transgenic technology, founded in the 80s, closes this gap.
At first it was an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also made its way into clinically oriented, specifically dermatological basic research.
With it, it became possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses on the murine model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Due to targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities with psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used for investigations of the wound healing process.
Furthermore, the transgenic technology enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The existence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows for targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in carriers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses and complaints inside the knee can be examined better by MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect carriers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) Movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) Induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by a distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in carriers of artificial heart valves does not seem sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on invisible examinations, or transferred the responsibility to the doctor who performs the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, the clinical circumstances and the prerequisites for MRI safety standards in carriers of artificial heart valves is given.
In an experimental study, intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with an average body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml of bolus administration, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), neither one of the animals died nor was resuscitation required.
Poorly soluble gases, such as argon, should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma annulare with a known diabetic metabolic condition.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed a balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole-body baths according to the foil method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin condition on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Not only epidermal, but also dermally localized processes can be therapeutically influenced by balneophotochemotherapy.
The cat scratch disease (KKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago, the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less often there are other organ manifestations.
We report about a 47-year-old patient who, after a cat bite, developed reactive spondarthrosis with synovialitis of the joints of the fingers, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbalgia.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint involvement in the context of a KKK have been described.
However, since the infection of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, it could be a more common cause of joint problems than previously thought.
The diagnosis of KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Due to continuous therapy optimization in recent years, the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved significantly.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications, of which the attending physician must be aware.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the mostly young patients are permanently impaired in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful therapy is a significant problem.
Starting from attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the aim was to operationalize these patterns appropriately in the sense of their original definition, i.e. as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "safe", "avoidant" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on factor analytical results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as attachment styles:
"safe", two variants of "insecure-ambivalent" ("closed" and "clinging") and two variants of "insecure-avoiding" ("closed" and "ready to cooperate").
The discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions similar to those of Collins U. Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of progressive inner ear deafness, vertigo and the simultaneous radiological detection of a contrast-absorbing spatial requirement of the inner ear canal confirm the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with anamnestically known Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented casuistry shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellar bridge angle, which manifested itself with a peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and, at first, the absence of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of a lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial paralysis that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings, as in the case described by us, must challenge, despite the existing leading symptoms, to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellar bridge angle is considered a rarity.
As further therapy options, balneotherapy and physiotherapy are available to the gynecologist in practice, clinic and in rehabilitation as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a natural healing procedure.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures are to be used mainly as supplementary measures according to the indications.
Only in the case of chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they suitable as primary measures, especially for pain reduction and positive tissue influence.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture is present and a subsequent sensitivity test is performed.
It takes seven to eight weeks before a negative cultural result is reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps by new methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The epidemiological situation of the risk of infection with tuberculosis, which is worrying all over the world, leaves no doubt that it is necessary to further develop methods that allow, in the shortest possible time, to detect, differentiate and test mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity for their sensitivity to antibiotics.
As part of a prospective randomized study, a non-joint-bridging installation of the small external fixator of the AO for the therapy of the distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the treatment by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with gypsum.
The collection of donated women's milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, for very immature premature babies, the milk of donors who themselves have children born too early is preferred.
Over the past 20 years, a large number of day care centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have been established in Germany as complementary day care centers.
The wide distribution of these institutions is in contrast to the lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on their way of working.
In this paper, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, the psychopathological symptomatology and the point of view of the visitors were collected.
Almost all visitors had already been in inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past.
The current psychopathological symptomatology varied considerably with moderate severity on average.
Two thirds of the visitors were berentet, most of them lived alone and had little or no friends.
The positive aspects of the facilities mentioned by the visitors were, in particular, the contact with other people and the day-to-day structuring.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the interference by other visitors.
The visitors of TSn were younger on average and had higher values in the BPRS subscale anergy.
Moreover, the visitors of the two institutions hardly differed in the characteristics studied.
The results indicate that both institutions actually provide care for chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration, for whose care they are also designed.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
The limits and consequences of the results are discussed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
By using fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods, it became possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With T1- and T2 *-weighted contrast medium-assisted imaging sequences, information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be recorded using special models, some of which come from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, the medullary vasculature, temporally resolved, with MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic investigations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be detected in a multidimensional way and metabolic processes can be observed in the course.
The advantages of MRI are its low invasiveness, the possibility of three-dimensional presentation of the data and any repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, the functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial investigations were able to show that the methods are able to sensitively detect pathophysiological changes in dementias and psychoses.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to place health protection as high as possible in the awareness of everyone in the countries of the European region, also in view of the constant political and economic change.
Health-impairing environmental factors are to be combated internationally by concrete measures or better avoided preventively.
An indispensable prerequisite is the understanding of international standards in the field of environment and health as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It must be ensured that governments and the respective population develop a common perception for the important environmental medical problem areas.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts necessary for this, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO Centre for Information and Communication in the Field of Environment and Health" (WHO-Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health) at the Robert Koch Institute in the summer of 1997 with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn.
It is reported about a 30-year-old patient who had a right-sided amaurosis fugax with simultaneous frontobasal fracture after a fall event.
By means of CT and MR angiography, a occlusion of the ophthalmic artery due to a dissection of the internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis could be proven as the cause.
There were no further neurological deficits, as sufficient blood flow to the cerebral arteries via the cerebri arteriosus circulus was ensured.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be considered, if necessary, etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
The suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires an immediate clarification with appropriate imaging procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, the suspicion of an aortic dissection was expressed echocardiographically in an asymptomatic patient.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was also used, in addition to other sectional imaging methods, to diagnose the detection of haustration of the aneurysmatically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was hospitalized for acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea and with a picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In the further clarification by means of echocardiography, a ruptured sinus-Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary sail with a left-right shunt into the right atrium could be determined by non-invasive means as the cause.
The cardiac surgical procedure proceeded without complications while preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right heart sections were normally wide, no shunt was detectable in the color doppler anymore.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be a consequence of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
By echocardiography and especially by transesophageal echocardiography, a precise diagnosis could be made by non-invasive means.
Signs of rodent syndrome are mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
Hypoplasia of the lower jaw can lead to airway obstruction due to the tongue resting against the back wall of the pharynx, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with Rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues had been pre-stretched by an extension treatment, a mandibular distraction osteogenesis was already performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic result are good.
Airway obstruction and dyspnea were no longer observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thrombendarterectomies (TEA) of the internal carotid artery lead to improved perfusion in the current area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood circulation during the operation.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (first ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework conditions for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice are largely defined, it is still unclear at the moment whether this independent medical service will be adequately rewarded.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
Nowadays there is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old patient who has been suffering from a progressive effluvium in psoriasis foci on the capillitium for years.
Histologically impressed strand-shaped fibrosations instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles and signs of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and the lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
The knowledge of this possible relationship is important insofar as a consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent the effluvium and thus probably the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormone (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
The treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely to be due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
The hypothesis is put forward that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with the consequence of reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, SVV was also effectively reduced in the long term under the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone.
With the present study, an osteoporosis animal model was to be created by means of ovarectomy.
Before and after the ovariectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovariectomy was observed in both the upper and lower jaw.
10 Patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were examined and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the hemorrhages were diverse:
In addition to vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence for bleeding from arroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy brought good results.
In Germany, toxic snake bite injuries in children are almost exclusively caused by viper (Vipera berus).
The cross viper injects a poison from various enzymes and hemorrhagic, as well as neurotoxic factors.
Viper bites in children can have few symptoms, but can also cause the most severe signs of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings can be displayed over a large area in their environment.
The transmission of the sonographic result to the therapist who is not present at the examination and the control of a result, e.g. a tumor, under therapy are thereby significantly improved.
Viruses, for their part, have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity around the world.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in an ever shorter time.
In this work, four case studies are used to investigate the factors that can influence an early or late point in time of the initial diagnosis of dementia.
We have provided the indication for surgery in all our cases.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily sewn over and as well as extensively rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the seam was additionally secured by fibrin bonding or with an omentum plastic.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Based on these own results and after evaluating the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified to us:
If a perforation is secured in the early stages, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Even with delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidney, Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more often.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that only rarely have larger fatty tissue-containing proportions.
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which could also have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous proportion with internal calcifications according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in various sectional imaging methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlate in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misidentified as a malignancy.
Due to the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in the differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
It is reported about a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month anamnesis, bloody-purulent expectoration and significant body weight reduction, who was assigned to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
It was only by a diagnostic detour that the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could be made.
The trigger for this was an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of the complaint were rapidly regressive and ultimately led to the healing of the patient.
Bronchoscopy is also an important component of diagnostics in the differential diagnostic evaluation of thoracic space requirements, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors, as well as germ cell tumors.
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient is described in which percutaneous embolization was unsuccessful due to unfavorable vascular anatomy.
Instead, the adjustable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, it was possible to successfully reduce liver perfusion and cardiac output and treat heart failure.
The described technique thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery if percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in biopsies of benign diseases in the own examination material in 20 years in 3%.
While puerperal mastitis occurs today in about 1% in relation to the number of births, the different forms of non-puerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as concomitant phenomena, the majority of mastitids currently to be diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small part is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases where there are no signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and if there is a suspicion of pathogen-related mastitis, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be carried out on the fresh material.
An infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in defenseless or antibiotic-treated patients.
We report about 2 5 or 14 year old boys with a Clostridium difficile-related colitis, without the mentioned preconditions or a certain basic condition existed.
The weaning procedure, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the application of a corresponding protocol leads to an earlier start of weaning and a significant reduction in the mechanical ventilation time.
Both the daily screening of the respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
As soon as the state and the ability of spontaneous breathing are documented, the extubation of the ventilated patients should be promoted, since sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of the ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing attempt.
Gradual discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous breathing attempts have not been successful.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to stop mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of weaning success and that the SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate should lead to an improvement in the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and the surgical result in 30 patients with unilateral LKG columns.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal grid photos and the lateral remote X-ray.
Deviations of the nasal symmetry, the width of the nose and the line of attachment of the wings of the nose from the ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurt horizontal.
The anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate the air permeability.
The total flow (cm3 / s) was determined, and the flow of the slit and non-slit side were compared.
The examinations were carried out immediately before and 6 months after the surgical intervention.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an approximation of the nasal wing inclination are achieved.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofacial angle and the low-standing wing of the nose was not achieved.
As a result of the intervention, the overall flow could be increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the gap side and the non-gap side could be achieved.
The examination methods used make it possible to objectify the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings and thus serve as a quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual therapy of the spine from the years 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications that have arisen in connection with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle joint diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably represent normal and acutely injured ligaments.
However, in the subacute and chronic stage of the injury, the joint fluid is often missing, which is necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, since intra-articular KM application distends the joint space with improved distinctness of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage assessment of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions, a KM flushing of the dissect can be more easily represented.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free articular bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
Although invasive, MR arthrography provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle joint diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the state before the onset of the emergency.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated in a rural area due to an out-of-hospital cardiovascular arrest of cardiac genesis.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of stem varicose of the V. saphena-magna and/or parva type.
Due to ascension, there may be a migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the mouths of the trunk veins into the groin and popliteal fossa or via insufficient Vv. perforants come, which threatens the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the trunk veins without the involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and/or parva and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient Vv. perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, the varicosis is surgically repaired only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes the crossectomy, the extirpation of the trunk vein via separate incisions, the exhairesis of all varicose branches and the ligation of insufficient Vv. perforantes.
In type III, thrombectomy via the V-saphena-magna and/or -parva estuary has priority over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral parts of the fingers and occurs almost only in young men.
Formally, pathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of forced actions seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome = HUS) are often accompanied by involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms are irritability, restlessness, states of confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological failures.
We are reporting a 52 year old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute brain-organic psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness up to coma.
The initial cranial computed tomography showed a discrete, general brain swelling, which regressed independently of the clinical deterioration.
The cranial magnetic resonance imaging was inconspicuous.
In transcranial Doppler sonography, generalized increases in flow velocity were found (a. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides, as well as a. basilaris).
The causal relationship between increases in flow velocity and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of the flow velocity increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow-up of the anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although the gold standard for the treatment of cruciate ligament injuries is replacement plastic, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent option for adolescents.
We report on the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
This was preceded by a blunt chest trauma in the context of a traffic accident.
The vascular injury could not be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography must be required, if possible, to exclude a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes have considerable differences from them.
With this short presentation of the American guidelines, the clinician should be provided with an informed decision-making aid for his own practical activity regarding many everyday, but by no means secondary problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng / kgKGxmin over a creep-in phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in the inflammatory parameters, the lung function, in particular the diffusion capacity and the pronounced acral circulatory disturbance.
Due to its central location, the elbow joint is to be regarded as the most important joint of the upper limb from a functional point of view.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the attending physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions on the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today there is hardly any doubt that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic restoration with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With an increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical peculiarities of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in the therapeutic principles has taken place in the last decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient on subcutaneous electrode sections palpable through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode progressions and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 70s.
This review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes the current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility of analyzing structures with tomographic accuracy in individual steps.
Image planes that cannot be displayed with conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes additionally allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different display options and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D ultrasonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early gravity.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 h on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paresthesias, burning pains in the legs arose as a result of the accidental infusion, combined with a motor and sensory loss of innervation up to the TH 11 segment. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
As a rule, complications such as those described are based on errors, the occurrence of which, although not impossible, can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include the color marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions, as well as the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir in order to reduce the frequency of syringe replacement.
The examination of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology so far.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of ridge height and width, the first step was to analyze 95 toothless bony upper jaws from collections that were sawn, measured and classified in a standardized way.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and evaluated differentiated by implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was performed in the clinical part of the study in 24 consecutive implant patients with a toothless upper jaw.
An implant placement on the cadaveric jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross sections, but with sufficient jaw height in a further 4.5% was actually to be expected.
Implant length reductions were additionally necessary in 6%.
There were dependencies, in particular, to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered much more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, none of the 24 patients was implantable.
Primarily insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times, with sufficient height, a transversally too narrow alveolar ridge turned out to be only under the operation.
The results allow to quantify the importance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimension.
This importance is primarily due to the bone height, although reductions in the implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain both on the cadaveric jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and on the patient (8%), for which the sole height measurement simulates incorrect conditions and a precisely planned surgical procedure may have to be canceled.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the scope of incorrect preoperative planning therefore justify or even require extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures in principle.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging method that can be used to investigate metabolic processes and non-morphological changes.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, they can be detected by means of radioactively labeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven itself with different tumor entities.
In this study, the PET was examined during lymph node staging of urinary bladder carcinoma.
In 64 patients, a pelvic PET was performed preoperatively after i. v. injection of fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG), so that the PET result could be compared with the histological result of the surgical preparation after classical surgical lymph node staging.
During lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients;
This data results in a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80%.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than the classic staging procedures, such as CT and MRI.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined from 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis to reveal an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal immunoglobulin total levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and / or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, then mucosal-sparing sinus surgery is indicated, which, however, cannot bring the desired success with this clinical picture alone.
An immune subclass deficiency is to be regarded as an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions into a severe immune deficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk, as well as on the right leg in the course of the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
There was a significant decrease in lesions during treatment with acitretin.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the "blaschkitis of the adult", first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resections has increased after nerve-sparing dissection and complete excision of the mesorectum have become widespread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinary incontinence between 25 and 67% can be found in the literature.
Materials and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were represented on 10 corpses and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic preparations.
Their positional relationship and possible locations of damage were presented and photodocumented during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with only little interindividual variability.
The inferior mesenteric artery forms a dense fibrous network around the trunk of the inferior mesenteric artery (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated via standard surgical access.
1. The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis have not been clearly clarified in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close positional relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes a sharp dissection under direct vision unavoidable.
4. Fascia and nerves can be used as guiding structures during dissection.
5. Selective sparing of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via standard surgical access.
The early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is important for the prognosis and groundbreaking for therapy planning.
In a prospective study, from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the lip were panendoscoped as part of the staging to check whether an early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract is possible with this method.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso-, oro- and hypopharynx.
The final stage was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological smears were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second cancers was 8.4%.
Precancerous diseases could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of second cancers in a primary in the "head and neck area".
Due to the good experiences so far and the complication-free course, there is obviously no additional risk to the patients as a result of this examination, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging for tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's chorea can cause significant problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the beginning of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with a confirmed Huntington's chorea, in whom the psychopathological changes formed the main symptomatology over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of the disease compared to other sick family members were exceptionally and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of the advance of the onset of the disease is well documented in the literature in the event of the transfer of the mutated gene from the father.
The attention to the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed collection of the family history were groundbreaking in terms of differential diagnosis.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with a different focus:
as climatotherapy, as (balneo-)phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain groups of patients benefit from this in different ways, indications for psychosomatic treatment are being worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such a therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological genesis or with psychological involvement, if there is depressiveness, functional complaints, previous emotional distress or psychotherapy motivation.
If there are problems in the processing of the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, it will be shown what importance orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses have in functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligamentous apparatus of the ankle joint.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of the orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influencing athletic performance as well as proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes on cemented polyethylene pans of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of shape changes on the polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion is detectable by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first few years after surgery, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it settles down to values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to prosthesis loosening.
In this study, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the marking wire of the socket in a total of 369 hip prostheses and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average running time of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
In the case of the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was achieved only in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The polyethylene - ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene - metal pairing.
For younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If there is an indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who are unable to give their consent, the approval of the supervisor is required to carry out the curative treatment.
The Regional Court of Hamburg, referring to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, had assumed the justified risk of a longer-lasting health damage and had approved the approval obligation.
However, taking into account the contraindications, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychoses.
The use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the dangers posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, a guardianship court approval obligation within the framework of the Childcare Act is to be denied.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance, among other things, by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European-MH group is the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnosis of MH predisposition due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%), as well as the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations on the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition.
After it was possible to detect the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene in an individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and compliance with IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnostics of malignant lymphomas in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system diseases of the child are relatively uniform sonographically:
initially, there are lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disruption of the normal echo texture, usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
Essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed sonographically on the parenchymatous organs:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "bulcky type".
A therapeutic success can be recognized on ultrasound by the normalization of the lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity and the regression of tumor- or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic indications result from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, with a certain reservation, on the basis of the echogenicity and the blood circulation conditions that can be analyzed Doppler sonographically.
The primary diagnosis is always to be confirmed histologically.
Background and question.
In the case of transient acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles are usually found clinically, predominantly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically, acantholysis is typical.
Although the etiology is still unclear, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
