Description (DESCRIPTION) The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking) .
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but as far as the compiler is concerned, the suffix controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c file, and sets the link in c format,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file, and sets the link in c++ form.
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and later operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i preprocessed c file; compile, assemble
.ii preprocessed c++ file; compile, assemble
.s assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h Preprocessor files; files that usually do not appear on the command line with other suffix names are passed to the linker (Linker). Usually include:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file (Archive file)
Linking is always the last step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or compilation errors prevent the complete process).
In the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to source programs, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including specified .o H standard files and .a library files) are passed to the linker in the order in the command line OPTIONS
Options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most `-=E : and `-W' options have two opposite forms: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly indicates that the language of subsequent input files is language (instead of the default selection obtained from the filename suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered. The language optional
Turns off any explicit specification of the language, so subsequent files are processed according to the filename rearrangement RE AS E ` -x' option).
If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use `~-c', `-s ' , or the `-E' option tells geo where to end. Note that some combination of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' followed by the `.ec' file name. Other names can be selected with the -o option. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option. matter.
the target file.
Stops after compiling, no assembly is performed.
Use pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers on those systems cannot read from pipes. The GNU assembler does not have this problem. C "dialects" accepted by assemblers: support ANSI compliant standard C program.
This will turn off some of the feature keywords in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as the ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that are denoted as welcome and rarely used, and even if used (Annotation: Hosted environment (hosted environment) ) is available in all standard libraries, and the main function returns an int value. A typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not exist in the standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', treat them C-style---that is, do not specify the number or types of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, such a function foo would have an empty argument in C++.
Section listings are cut here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual for details, we've removed the details so that people don't HERI when the content becomes obsolete.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option has the side effect of allowing assignment to this.
It has the same effect as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp Attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Specifically what is mentioned above about the preprocessor, but not other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allow `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the `“-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the `$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allow implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).
Normally GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal--templates Generate smaller code (c++ only) for template declarations by, for each template function, making a copy only where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use templates.
When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates ', template instantiations are all external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with a typedef that references each instance needed.
Correspondingly, if compiled with the default `-fno-exteznal-templates' option, all template instances are explicitly set as built-ins.
All member functions (except constructor functions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the enclosing class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal vtable.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it will be called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allow type mismatch between the second and third arguments of the condition expression.
The value of this expression is Void. -fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (only for C++).
Incorporating user-defined free storage management into C++ makes assignable `this' anachronistic.
Therefore, by default, assignment to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can enable this with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Define char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char type. It may be unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the signedness of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect this to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the machine the program is written for).
This option, and its inverse, make that program work on the corresponding default.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like either.
If no `signed' or "unsigned' modifiers are explicitly specified, these options are used to define signed or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bitfields are signed, since the underlying integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings store string constants in the writable data segment, and do not treat them specially.
This is for compatibility with older programs, who consider changing string constants to be a very bad idea. The `-traditional' option has the same effect.
executive Summary
Impact of COVID-19 on drug markets
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services to the point of collapse, and restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruption in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the outbreak is unclear and difficult to predict, but could be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.
The shift brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are some lessons that can be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek out cheaper synthetic substances, and usage patterns shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments responded to the current recession in the same way, interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be lowered in priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled via commercial flights.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. The use of commercial air travel to supply drugs could be completely disrupted as restrictions on air passenger traffic are imposed almost everywhere.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, there is likely to be an increase in trafficking using the darknet and postal delivery of goods.
In the long run, the recession and associated lockdowns could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, the poor and vulnerable will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders, and turn to illicit drug-related activities—whether producing or transporting them.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to bolster their ranks.
With reduced government capacity to respond, these shifts could quickly take hold as the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
market growth
Population Growth Patterns Partially Explain Market Expansion
Drug use has been increasing around the world, both in overall figures and as a percentage of the world's population who use drugs.
In 2009 there were an estimated 210 million drug users, or 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018 there were an estimated 269 million drug users, or 5.3% of this population.
During the past two decades, drug use has grown much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.
This partly reflects differences in overall population growth over the period, 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects faster growth in young populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
Drug use is more common in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive movement of people from rural to urban areas - more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, compared to 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization tends to be more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.
Likewise, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among wealthier segments of society.
However, the higher rates of transition to substance use disorders are among those of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a handful of countries show a link between harmful drug use patterns and conditions and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to increased drug use, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work around the world.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug market Had to take risks and engage in illegal activities.
Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of reduced air and land traffic due to COVID-19-related restrictions, where the risk of interception is low and higher volumes are smuggled than by air or land.
Recently there have been reports of shipments of cocaine direct from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The presence of substances not under international control is stable, but new and potentially harmful opioids are on the rise The drug market is becoming more complex.
To the plant-based substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of medicines is also rapidly increasing.
There are about 500 new active substances per year on the domestic market of Member States.
Most of these are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
While the overall number of NPS has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Opioid NPS accounted for only 2% of the total number of NPS identified in 2014, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.
The NPS opioids, many of which are analogues of fentanyl, have proven efficacy and harm, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that injecting NPS stimulants also occurs in Europe: A study of the residues of discarded syringes in six European cities finds that many are stained with NPS that produce stimulants》
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become firmly established in vulnerable groups
A single class of NPS almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of NPS in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drugmakers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors in the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and makers are always looking for alternatives—not just less regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent them, so-called "designer precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: In March 2020, shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia were reported to have contributed to increases in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replacing opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by Russian Federation authorities has fallen by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has dropped significantly.
But the doping market seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in recent seizures of clandestine laboratories manufacturing a variety of illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern alongside "captagon" and tramadol.
A 2015 study reinforced these findings, with drug users saying marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "captagon" or methamphetamine.
More recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the importation of large quantities of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.
Seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily rising since then.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 totaled 657kg - a sharp jump from the previous year.
Large seizures in other countries of methamphetamine thought to have originated in Afghanistan also suggest that production in that country is rapidly rising.
Policy Changes and Trends
Jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis show a trend towards increased cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical use of marijuana among adults has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or near-daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent cannabis use.
Short-term data from Canada also show that the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019 while usage increased.
However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illicit sources.
Is marijuana legalization behind plummeting global marijuana herb seizures?
Global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, as seizures fell in North America, down 84% over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of NPS appears to have a deterrent effect The domestic regulation of NPS remains difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for NPS show different prevalence of NPS use.
In other countries, the use of NPS has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable populations face harm from legal and illicit drug markets Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries Pain relief is unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90 per cent of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for approximately 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries, home to 88% of the global population, consume less than 10% of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a substance use disorder Some 35.6 million people suffered from a substance use disorder in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries where individuals' unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a certain point in time - are also associated with drug use disorder risk.
Drug use disorders can also deepen socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders or experience problems accessing treatment services.
The wider societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years, according to the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) indicator, which estimates years of healthy life lost to disability and premature death.
Global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17% between 2007 and 2018.
The increase in DALYs associated with liver cancer from untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high – up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is intricate and difficult to establish all causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data worldwide suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a bigger role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be attributed in part to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity resulting from personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of high-profile criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
latest trends
Marijuana is most commonly used substance, opioids most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
But the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked due to the low number of users.
Substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017 and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to be lost to disability or premature death from drug use. caused by substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that is fueling the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions, which have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general drug use patterns, are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by readily available and cheaply produced substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has contributed to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.
Part of the reason fentanyl is responsible for overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.
The market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.
There is an increasing number of patients receiving treatment for tramadol use disorders in the region.
The amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly in 2017, peaking at more than 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
Contributing to the crisis in both places is the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors.
Compounding the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available in both pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making their abuse even more difficult to detect and prevent.
Doping use on the rise
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing rising use in their major markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.
Some 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used ATS in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been increasing in both regions for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can co-exist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that use of one drug rises while the use of the other falls, sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet demand in the same market.
COVID-19 Puts Injecting Drug Users at Higher Risk
An estimated 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections are attributable to injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
Of the estimated 585,000 drug deaths in 2017, half were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains mostly untreated among people who inject drugs.
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute for more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
More harmful patterns of use may emerge as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.

EU summit debates on refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks in the admission process-Chinanews.com
EU summit quarrels over refugee policy, EU officials: There are bottlenecks in every step of the acceptance process
[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse’s report on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration. This makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's move is in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which is now at the heart of the EU's low number of illegal immigrants who end up being deported.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funding" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats in some member states said if the EU shared the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along its external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the process.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks in every step of the refugee admission process. "Permanent Crisis".
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half compared to the previous year.
Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against that backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries could deport illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state.
In addition, the report said, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state", which will open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The U.S. escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com
Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has been escalating. First, under the pressure of the U.S., the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; later, foreign media reported that the U.S. government is considering cutting off All connections between U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to restrict U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry... 2023 will soon begin However, the United States has continued to make evil moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "chips". While precisely suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it is building a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely "get rid of" the advanced semiconductor industry. China.
Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technical alliance", or to establish a chip "four-party alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "four-party mechanism" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, and the "Indo-Pacific Economic Framework""""" In order to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its position in the global chip industry Dominance.
However, the US's "core tactics" against China with great fanfare is also "injury to the enemy by one thousand and self-injury to eight hundred".
Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export ban on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography machine giant ASML recently warned that the ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to higher semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government imposed brutal suppression on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves. wait.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to estimates by professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process takes 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced manufacturing processes, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regional development of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has vigorously "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, severely damaging the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively promulgating the "Innovation and Competition Act", "American Competition Act of 2022", "Chips and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its leading edge in technology; It forced Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, trying to ensure the United States' global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused troubles for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced China's chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs, depriving itself of the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products can only be held for 360 days at the shortest time-Chinanews.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale
7 products from home institutions can be selected for a minimum of 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally launched.
On February 10, China Finance Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products. Seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially launched.
So far, the "shelves" of personal pension accounts have finally collected four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all open-ended public offering net worth products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for 1 product that is a mixed product, the remaining 6 products are fixed income products.
The Beijing Youth Daily reporter saw that 4 of the 5 new products came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed-income products. The minimum holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days. The corresponding performance comparison The benchmarks (annualized) are 3.70%-4.20%, 4.10%-4.60%, 4.40%-4.90%, 5.25%-5.75%.
The remaining one newly released product is "Post Bank Fortune Tianyi · Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed-income product. The fundraising started on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is Level 2 .
Among the two surviving products, one is the ABC Wealth Management "ABC Tongxin Smart" 360-day technological innovation RMB wealth management product, the investment nature is mixed, and the risk level is three.
Another surviving product is "Post Bank Fortune Tianyi · Hongjin No. 1 with the shortest holding period of 365 days", which is a fixed-income type. It started raising on December 30 last year and officially started operation on January 4 this year. Equity is 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions", the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public offering fund products and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice specifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in 36 leading cities and regions including Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiongan New District, and Jincheng in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants will be 19.54 million, the number of contributors will be 6.13 million, and the total payment amount will be 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot had only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public offering funds.
Now that personal pension and wealth management products are also available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D Department of Bank of Communications Financial Products said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension financial products in the pilot phase and personal pension financial products have three characteristics.
The first is robustness. The risk management mechanism is more complete, the investment strategy and philosophy are more stable, and the third-party independent custody of the non-parent bank is implemented.
The second is long-term. The term of the pension wealth management products in the pilot phase is 5 years or more. The personal pension wealth management products to be issued in the next step have a minimum holding period of 1 year in principle, and are encouraged to hold more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness. The product purchase threshold is low. The minimum purchase point is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The product custody fee, management fee and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should make choices based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate, and high security, which are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks but can accept stable returns; However, personal pension wealth management products and public offering fund products do not guarantee capital or income, and have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are relatively high, and they are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-taking ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Chinanews.com
Another large gym "thunderstorm"?
Recently, the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness members' rights protection issues have attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Later, rumors about the organization’s closure and escape caused panic among members, which led to the intervention of the public security and human resources and social security departments.
In the end, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil subsided.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers can calmly wait for the problem to be resolved. Why do many members' first reaction is "something is not good"?
Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Traditional domestic gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money that users can't come" is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through the pre-sale of membership cards, and constantly opening new stores, seems to be able to repeat itself, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information about industries such as running in the gym frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms can of course be regarded as a good business with "money prospects".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted the attention of capital.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of healthy living deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation is, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. Just after coming out of the crisis, they sounded the clarion call to expand the territory and invested all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in the past few years, many institutions have withdrawn and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, powerful companies are selectively increasing their acquisitions and reorganizing their layout. This may not be a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and take a steady and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change its business strategy.
Only by working steadily and re-establishing the trust and sense of security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry needs now is to settle down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the "user orientation", closely focus on user needs, and focus on improving service quality and upgrading.
Second, rely on digital transformation to improve user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model enables users to pay per view and choose venues on their own.
At the same time, body data and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and realize a complete closed-loop service from online to offline.
There is no personal training promotion, no huge annual card, users are less worried about "running away" from fitness institutions, and their sense of trust is also improved.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.
Today, sports consumption has shifted from a single service to scene consumption. Fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy expensive refund price difference!
Nanjing property market reappears "payment for price difference"-Chinanews.com
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement" that had not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market. Before the house is handed over, the discount of other housing sources is greater than the previous discount. The developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are many conditions for the "guaranteed price agreement"
This real estate located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyun Terrace. Mr. Sun, the viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he was shopping for real estate last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the real estate promises that anyone who purchases a house between February 1 and February 28 will start from the date when the two parties sign the sales contract until the delivery of the corresponding house. If the preferential discount of other houses is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous house purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial house), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference .
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price protection agreement", the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease and don't have to worry about the price reduction of the development company. Time, if you don't make trouble, it's really sweet.
There are still many house buyers who believe that although the "price protection agreement" is to give house buyers "reassurance", the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who intends to buy a new house in Jiangbei, said that the price-insured house must first be of the same type, in the same building, and in the same unit. There are very few houses that buyers can compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
There are also buyers who believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during the sale, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights".
Whether it can keep buyers remains to be seen
The reporter inquired on the real estate online in Nanjing and learned that the real estate sold a total of 252 suites in two buildings in November last year. The price is 39843 yuan/m2.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this building is 157, accounting for 62.3%. There are also 44 unsold sets, and the total number of transactions of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, the "guaranteed price agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Price Guarantee Plan" in order to attract the attention of house buyers. Return the difference to the old owner."
Afterwards, in April 2011, 9 real estate properties in Nanjing took out part of their listings and promised to "compensate for the price difference".
"The property market is picking up, and at this time we need a shot of 'heart booster'.
"Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the "price protection agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that development companies need more confidence than house buyers nowadays, and the launch of the "price protection agreement" is actually to encourage them.
As for whether the buyers can be retained, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen at present.
Taiwan's economy performed poorly in the beginning of the year due to a number of data recessions-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) The export trade volume is "five blacks in a row", the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) has shrunk for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen " 3 prefix"...Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
According to expert analysis, Taiwan's economy performed poorly at the beginning of the year, and the growth pressure is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, an annual decrease of 21.2%, and it was the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
Compared with the same period last year, the export value of 11 major export categories all declined.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the most, with an annual decrease of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components and components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest drop in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, head of the statistics department of the department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, and the excess amount was only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the decline in global end-use demand and the adjustment of industrial inventories have restrained manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials. The decline in exports will hardly improve in the short term. Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to Taiwan's Chung Hwa Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, PMI takes 50% as the line of prosperity and decline, and an index greater than 50% means that the economy is expanding, and vice versa is contraction.
Among the five components of Taiwan’s PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment tightened, suppliers’ delivery times decreased, and inventories tightened.
The six major industries all reported PMI contraction, and the industries were ranked according to the speed of contraction as electric power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optical industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw material industry ( 42.4%), transportation industry ( 42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, Taiwan's "General Office of Accounting and Accounting" announced that in January this year, the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI was 3.04%, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special committee member of Taiwan's "General Office of Accounting and Accounting", said frankly that the increase in vegetable prices has indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists and is still high. point.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on the reports of Taiwan's media such as "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance".
Wu Daren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads manufacturers to cut labor costs, which affects the labor market and the household economy, which in turn impacts consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is still unresolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the decline in Taiwan's exports will continue into the first half of the year.
Since Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, affected by the sluggish exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An important engine for global recovery" - Chinanews.com
"In response to the impact of the new crown epidemic, the Chinese economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China not only leverages the strengths of the market economy, but also leverages the superiority of the socialist system, and takes proactive measures to stabilize the economy.

"Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
"Rios said that he looks forward to the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" cooperation to continue to play its important role in improving the level of infrastructure in various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and to continue to release greater momentum.

Based on South Korean "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Li Xuezhu with their daughter Kim Joo-ae attending the dinner on the 7th, Kim Joo-ae is not only rarely sitting in the C seat between his parents, but also on the 75th anniversary of the Army Day the next night At the military parade, she also stood on the rostrum with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" released a video of the military parade afterwards, exposing more scenes of the deep love between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the rostrum. The smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Joo-ae cupped his father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also showed that when Kim Joo-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on an indoor sofa chair, she kept touching her father's face with her hands; when she and her father were walking arm in arm, they touched Kim Jong-un's chest with their hands.
The first lady, Li Xuezhu, could only walk behind or sit aside, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo-ae made his first public appearance on November 18 last year when he test-fired the Hwasong-17 missile, the probability of exposure has been increasing in the past three months, and this is the fifth time he has appeared on a formal occasion.
North Korea’s official media mentioned Kim Joo-ae using extremely high titles such as dearest son and honored son, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Joo-ae repeatedly shouting and vowing to support the white-headed blood while overlooking the military parade from the stands.
These signs make the outside world wonder whether Kim Joo-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un has pushed his middle-school-age daughter to the position of successor." However, there are also views that such It is still too early to judge. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son, there are still various possibilities.
Chongyang Q&A—How to view the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeded expectations and future trends- Economic Observation Network-Professional financial news website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-agricultural employment data in January exceeding expectations and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-agricultural employment data for January 2023. New non-agricultural employment was 517,000, which was much higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the highest level in the past 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, a slight slowdown.
From the perspective of the total amount, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in the data this time, such as the faculty and staff returning to work on strike, the revision of the survey statistics, and the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (refer to 2022 1 The monthly increase in non-agricultural employment was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; new employment in high-touch service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combined with the rebound in service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has ushered in a quick recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US job market will hardly improve without going through a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, while the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings of American residents and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further lag the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the background of the U.S. economy in 2023.
Superposition is now approaching the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations continue to fluctuate. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of the data, the U.S. stock, bond and exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed’s rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed’s hawkish statement. It not only expects to stop raising interest rates early, but also expects two cut interest rates.
In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impacts of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve’s guidance for raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded transactions may cause some damage to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of salary growth cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. As the M2 data turned negative year-on-year and the leading indicators of various CPI sub-items gradually improved, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of the growth rate will only form a foundation for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of games.
Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, died of a sudden heart attack and led the transformation of China's first clothing company.
Economic Observation Network reporter Zheng Yuxin On February 11, the official WeChat account of Shanshan Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holding") issued an obituary. Treatment for heart disease was ineffective, and he died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory. After being transferred, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Enterprise Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the Shanshan brand The market share was once as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized, "Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market. It is unlikely to be taken."
In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to do in transformation. We specially found many experts and scholars, and held some Zhugeliang meetings and retreat seminars continuously.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Institute of Thermal Energy’s carbon research institute supporting Ansteel was working on a national 863 project, and the research funds were insufficient. So Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realized the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesocarbon microspheres, and began to replace Japan as the main supplier of mesocarbon microspheres in China.
This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was included in the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year until 2013. Shanshan's lithium battery material business has more revenue than its clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem’s polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company Shanjin Optoelectronics. This field has relatively high technology content. Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies , such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, “The probability of success for Chinese private enterprises to acquire some international high-tech companies is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I have spent so much money, I have to send someone to take care of it, right? This is a common behavior.” However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan’s acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanshan Optoelectronics publicly announced that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, Shanshan Enterprises will not send people to Shanshan Enterprises. Culture, management and other models remain unchanged.
ICC Xinyu Information released the negative electrode data for 2022, showing that Shanshan’s negative electrode shipments in 2022 will exceed 200,000 tons, a year-on-year increase of 100%, and its market share will reach 16%. The shipment of artificial graphite negative electrode materials will continue to top the list.
In terms of polarizer business, statistics from Yano Research show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics will have a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan’s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, Shanshan’s stock price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphitization production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization production capacity of the Meishan project will still be climbing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan shares.
According to Tianyan Check, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total equity of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Shanshan Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd. .
Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the investor interaction platform on February 10 that there is no kinship relationship between the company's senior management and the company's actual controller.

Reached a defense consensus with the United States, Japan and the Philippines against the CCP
Asia – On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP’s invasion of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. The leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement after the meeting, stating that they will sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP’s hegemonic policy.
According to the Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos visited China in early January this year and won deals worth US$20 billion.
But after that, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the U.S. military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the CCP" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: under the 1992 consensus, green camps are welcome to visit the mainland
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, during his visit to China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Affairs Foundation, an official organization of the Kuomintang, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, and positively commented on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that as long as he agrees with the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes people from the green camp to visit the mainland.
The KMT commented that it was something new.
The news on the day Xia Liyan met Song Tao earlier did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party clarified its rejection of the "1992 Consensus" for several days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit China. During their stay in Beijing, they met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and said that the political basis of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior consultant of the Kuomintang Foundation, said at the meeting that the "1992 Consensus" of the Kuomintang is the original "92 Consensus". Second Consensus".
According to Zhao Chunshan's analysis, this is different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In recent video conferences with academic circles in mainland China, as well as in this conference, we did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about military reunification and the "anti-secession law." Instead, we resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the strait are fighting fiercely, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party, the other party is still willing to do a good job in dealing with the Taiwanese, which means that they do not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally ordered to tell Song Tao, "You must implement the demands they (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen) raised."
The report did not mention whether the KMT members visited the mainland to mention the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military planes and warships, the agricultural and fishery issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether reporters from the Central News Agency asked such questions in interviews.
French trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's retirement reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's pension reform draft, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in the social unrest against the government's draft reform of the pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call may affect the next action plan of the trade union group.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight major trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and it is also the first time that this protest has arranged a rally on Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people who don't have to choose between protesting or striking with wages, union groups are hoping today's rally will attract more people.
The unions of the public transportation system subway and the public railway company did not call for a strike today. The public transportation system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take cars to the assembly site.
Trade union groups hope more than a million people will turn out for today's rally, while police expect between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide and 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually took to the streets to participate in the demonstrations has gradually increased. reduce.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
The crowd of demonstrators on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people across the country.
The pension reform program is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition group headed by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, so that the review process is moving very slowly.
And the debate between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical leftist French Independence Party has sparked protests from the ruling party after he posted on social media a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the portrait of the labor minister on it.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the MP from parliamentary activities as punishment for such behaviour.
Although this reform plan has triggered the largest social disturbance in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has slightly adjusted the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The trade unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th. On March 7, when the reform bill is sent to the Senate for discussion, the trade unions also plan to organize demonstrations.
China encourages raising fertility rate to high standards of sperm quality in colleges and universities
The Human Sperm Bank of China’s Yunnan Province issued a promotion on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from those with a college degree or above or school students. If you successfully donate 8 to 12 times, you will receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the news rushed to Weibo hot searches that day, and triggered follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a signed report by the Free Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
For sperm donation from colleges and universities across the country, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of at least 170 cm, good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and a myopia degree of no more than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of andrological physical examination worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done it, which is of great significance to understand their fertility status."
The requirements for sperm donors include those with a height of 165 cm or more, a college degree or above or those who are studying, without color blindness, color weakness, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China’s Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank in Shaanxi Province printed a promotional poster with “Paid Sperm Donation, Unlimited Glory”, calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and “let the love spread”.
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan. Those who pass the test can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who have completed a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
At present, the highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 RMB.
East Germany's last communist chancellor dies today
The successor to the East German communist party reported in a statement, "Hans Modrow left us last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modelo said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
When the Soviet Union came to power, Mikhail Gorbachev demanded changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modelo declared the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results resulted in him no longer serving as prime minister.
Despite Modelo's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modelo was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to jail.
Some say the charges are politically motivated.
Modelo went on to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and as a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modelo sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return but said it should be recognized for its achievements.
Modelo was born in 1928 in what was then the German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a machinist.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in a youth fire brigade, and toward the end of the conflict he became a member of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia organization that recruited men aged 16 to 60 to fight in the last struggles of the war.
At 17, Modelo was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist Party member.
On his return in 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he found work as a mechanic and went on to study social sciences and economics, earning a Ph.D.
Modelo was a staff member of the Free German Youth movement, which nearly all young East Germans joined, and was promoted to the Dresden region by the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) between 1973 and 1989 party chairman.
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years.
Modelo became the de facto leader of East Germany in 1990, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks revolution anniversary, pro-protest hackers hack president's televised speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of Iran's revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised address.
The president's live televised address was interrupted for about a minute on the Internet, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers called "Edalat Ali" (Justice Ali) appeared on the screen.
A voice was also seen shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
Hackers interrupted state television coverage as Iran marked the anniversary of its revolution, Reuters reported today.
As Iran officially marks the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Lacey's hardline government faces the boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Lacey still calls on "deceived youth" to repent so they can get Iran's supreme leader pardon.
Nationwide protests are still raging in Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iranian security forces have launched a deadly crackdown on protests in one of the most formidable challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since a 1979 revolution that overthrew the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei earlier issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, human rights group HRANA reported.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the evening of the anniversary of Iran's revolution on Friday night, state media showed fireworks as part of government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)".
However, many could also be heard at the rally shouting "Death to the dictator!
’ and ‘Death to the Islamic Republic’ in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, home-made anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacey's speeches were frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America" -- a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor that has soured relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she was back in jail.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Mesami's release came a week after supporters warned he was at risk of death as a result of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the mandatory wearing of the hijab.
Responding to Adelkhah's release on Friday, the French foreign ministry called for her freedom to be restored, "including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.
"
Will the balloon incident brighten the eyes of the United States?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a Wall Street Journal report today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would build political support for stronger U.S. technology protections.
The U.S. said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of the hardliners on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, “We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China’s larger surveillance activities that have Threats to our national security and to our allies and partners.
U.S. officials said they had notified the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination was crucial to countering the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the U.S. House of Representatives' new ad hoc committee on strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the U.S. to take tougher measures to slow China's progress. develop.
Members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force a tougher policy from the White House, she said.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also already formulating a foreign investment review plan to examine whether there are potential national security threats from China in U.S. overseas investments.
Analysts said the White House could face calls for a faster rollout of the program.
Turkey-Syria Earthquake Relief Works Day and Night
Rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working around the clock in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to free survivors buried under the rubble since the powerful earthquake hit Turkey and neighboring Syria.
In freezing temperatures, they often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Reuters reported today that two more women had been rescued after surviving days in the devastation of the quake.
However, the death toll from the quake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665 and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several powerful aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster this century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 2003 quake in neighboring Iran that killed 31,000 people die.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers have pulled two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours after the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said on Saturday.
Another injured man, identified as Masallah Cicek, 55, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Crouching under concrete slabs and whispering "Inshallah" - "God bless" - in Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers cautiously reached into the rubble to free a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes widened as baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking his mother, who was dazed and pale but conscious on a stretcher.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and 31,000 rescuers had been mobilized in the affected areas.
Some 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were left homeless by the quake and crammed into makeshift shelters, he said.
Questions have grown about the leaders of both countries over their response to the disaster, as many people lack food in frigid winter conditions.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled with his wife Asma to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit since the earthquake, according to Syrian state media. Go to the affected area.
Earlier, the World Food Program said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
Erdogan, who visited Turkey's Adiyaman province on Friday, acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over delays in delivering aid and launching rescue efforts could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as Erdogan's most serious challenge in his two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a "passive campaign for political gain".
Kemal Kildaroglu, leader of Turkey's main opposition party, criticized the government's response.
"The earthquake was big, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence," the critic said.

What exactly was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
confusing, guesswork
The U.S. military once again used its most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, U.S., on Friday afternoon (February 10).
It was shot down ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
A spy balloon from China was shot down near the coast of South Carolina after days of drifting in U.S. airspace on Saturday.
The second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), the Pentagon said. The car is about the same, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.
White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said Friday that while the high-flying object's exact appearance was unclear, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" suspended from it.
"What we call an 'object' is the best description we can currently make," Bryant said.
President Biden took the Pentagon's advice before ordering the object down, a decision he made "very carefully," Bryant added.
The US official description of this object can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is equivalent to a small car, there is no joystick, no suspension device, and the flying height is about 10,000 meters.
But this information cannot yet answer basic questions, such as what the object really is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.
At present, many analyzes and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China, as did the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some kind of mission in a different location.
Some people also associate this "object" in Alaska with a "unidentified flying object" (UFO).
U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday, "Wish this 'UFO' was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO ".
"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," Major said.
Major's tweet came shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Major was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO, Newsweek said.
Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) criticized the administration's intelligence cover-up last month, demanding that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
I can't believe Amazon's customer service attitude
It is estimated that few people see this, but I also want to say a little bit.
This dress was a zipper hoodie when we bought it, and it was a short-sleeved one for me in the end.
Immediately after receiving the clothes, I got in touch with Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw that the name of the product changed to short sleeves. It turned out that the link I bought was taken off the shelf.
Then the customer service notified to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable that the wrong clothes are not my problem. As a consumer, I ask for the goods I should get, and I don't make any exaggerated demands. Amazon changes the name and says it's out of stock.
This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.
incomprehensible sleeves
It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, and it is not clear whether it is genuine leather. In addition, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of jackets are longer than the hem of the clothes. , but usually only 1-2 centimeters, this dress is a full 5 centimeters long, the arms should naturally hang down in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returns are easy.
But I really don't know when to get the money back?
The workmanship of the clothes is good, because the size is too small, I had to return the goods. After returning the goods, more than a week has passed, and I have not received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact the Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying Amazon items!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating with the courier and urging the refund in a timely manner, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, and the refund is delayed for about half a month. This kind of partner is to hold back Amazon. Yes, poor work efficiency and no sense of service!
more suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the wool pants are all good, soft/thin and moderate, and have no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, the flat waist is 2 feet 5, the maximum stretch size is 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg, the waist is a bit tight.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen up the waistline.
Plus, it's uncomfortable to wear next to your body.
very good the color is not very bright
What's the situation when I just bought it and it went up by more than 200.
It was the first time that Amazon used the cooperating Tiantianbai Express. The first delivery was not at home. Later, I took the initiative to make two delivery appointments with the courier. The courier refused to deliver, and then returned it directly to me. The courier has no integrity at all, and it is strongly recommended not to use that bad courier any more.
This time, I also returned a t-shirt, and the price was increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon self-operated should not appear such a product
I bought it when the product was on sale, the price is not low, and it is also a very good product after reading the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there were wears in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. The picture will be shown later.
I applied to return the product, and the people from the manufacturer saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation. Isn’t this nonsense?
How can an item be worn down inside?
There are only two possibilities, either it is a defective product, or I damaged the product on purpose and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such products should not appear in Amazon’s self-operated products. Customers who choose Amazon’s self-operated products are trust, customer win , we win, the customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, I hope everyone will work hard to improve, thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and there are two E2s, I don’t know how to deal with it?
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 appeared on the two groups on the right side of the receiver. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is consistent with the continuous work of the transmitter module mentioned on the Amazon website. 7 years does not quite match, and I can’t find after-sales service on the Amazon website. , I don’t know what to do now?
Okay
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was also torn.
And it's always a white screen.
It will be fine after changing.
The replacement is very fast, it is a bit blurry at night, and the viewing angle is not very wide, but it is enough for ordinary household use.
The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. Not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker like a chapter that can be attached to the warranty card. Not this time.
I don't know if it's because things are cheap, so I'm confused.
Waiting for supplier reply
There is no mark on the package, so I called the supplier directly and said that the answer is that there is no mark, it is a genuine product. If there is any doubt, I can mail it to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and leave the license plate number and phone number. I promise to send a text message to notify my information into Johnson & Johnson. The warranty card on the official website has not received a text message until now?
Received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon self-operated products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil is clear and it is indeed good oil.
Because it is the second purchase.
So I'm still very relieved.
The express delivery is fast, and the packaging is not picky. After using this oil, the engine sound has dropped significantly.
The price/performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic motor oil under 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, and effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitting mistakes, but always refusing, always emphasizing that the goods are a third party, and the third party cannot be restrained.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The page size options I bought at the beginning were 7c, 8, 9c. At that time, I thought this was a trap. I called Nichia’s Chinese customer service and told me that 8 was 8c. However, I found that it was only 8cm when the product returned to China. I think this is completely a trap deliberately set to trap Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now there is no such option on the viewing page.
Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we give you two ways:
1. You return the product, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2. If you do not return the goods, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.
(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4,000 yen, which counts as 200rmb, choose 1, I don’t have shoes, and the loss is 200 yuan.
Choice 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I replied an email, saying that I would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service. It is over.
I proposed: when the purchase page has confusing options such as 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that Japan’s common codes do not include c, similar to 140, but you guys have gone to other caterpillar pages to look at it?
There is a mix of US and Japanese sizes.
Besides, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, it is obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don’t know that you are going to ship it back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping cost.
I don’t understand this logic again. I’m Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. China living in Japan doesn’t need Chinese customer service. Visitors to Japan don’t have the skills to make international long distance calls. Then the question arises, who needs to call? Amazon's overseas purchases of Chinese phones are nothing more than day-to-day shopping like me.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for those of us overseas shopping?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was 2 months old. I chose diapers made of paper imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with the first purchase experience. The baby used them all night One diaper can indeed satisfy 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L size diapers, there are 2 packs in a box and they are packed separately. After opening, I feel that the paper is loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for babies, it is not bad. There is no leakage of urine or signs of rash.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, a rash appeared on the inner thighs of the baby immediately after using it, and it hasn't faded yet.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packages in 1 box is not the same.
Should not continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the transportation protection of the package
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for a long time. There are no protective measures at all. Cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed, and the card box was pressed open and deformed.
I hope that the quality of the genuine product is guaranteed, and I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I would rather be half as expensive in China and have a guarantee.
And the product packaging problem, I read the comments in 2016, someone commented on it, and it is still the same in 19 years.
It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and it is far behind domestic JD.com and Tmall.
Beautiful, but a little sad
I really like the color of the whole cup, orange-red. Although my family is a boy, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed off, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertical, my son always had to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. , I think this place can be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Portable and large capacity
I like that it is light and has a large opening, but two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, and I don’t know what to pack.
After buying it, I found that there is another brand that is very similar on Overseas Buy Meiya, and it is less than 200 yuan.
Fake, fake is very powerful
Amazon sells fakes, and I'm convinced too.
The customer service said that the product cannot be returned because it has been used. How can I know it is a fake if it is useless?
I am sad because of trust. After all, it is a product for wiping your face. You should really go to a physical store to buy it. It is admitted that it is more expensive.
Because it is a spike, so I didn’t read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let’s defend our rights together.
broken?
Fake?
All in all tragic.
When I used the second piece, the pores were fine, but when I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn’t used this one before, and then I couldn’t stand it when I put it on my face. It smells very strong. , It’s indescribable, so smoked that I immediately coughed out, my eyes hurt, and tears flowed, so I took it off immediately to wash my face.
Buxinxie opened another slice of the same type, it doesn’t have such a strong smell, and it’s being applied now.
In retrospect, it kind of smells like bad perm water in a hair salon.
It's really unimaginable, is it difficult for Amazon's self-operated skin care products to be avoided from now on?
profiteer
When I bought it, the event page said that I would give away the "Complete Works of Three-Body Problem" when I spent 99 yuan. When I received the goods, I didn't have this gift. I called the customer service and said that I would show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who bought something and saved the screenshots of the webpage. You need customers to provide you with the activities you have done yourself. Buyers should be careful next time and keep the evidence.
Feeling after use
This is the first time I bought something on Amazon. I have a few points of experience. Let me talk about the feeling of using up the product first. The first thing is that it is painless and has no irritating taste. Overall it is very good. Wait for 8 minutes It will fall off after wiping left and right, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it, which cannot be seen unless you look closely, so overall it is good. As for after using it once, you need to continue to observe, and you will know if you continue to use it.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second is to place an order on the 27th and receive the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month. The service attitude of Amazon's delivery staff is also very good.
Third, don’t believe Amazon’s Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it’s nearly 12 yuan cheaper, which means I bought it for more than 170 (plus shipping). The price feels kind.
The customer service said that the price fluctuates. I have paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is like this, and the fluctuation is not big.
Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with granules, definitely repurchase!
There are granules in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, and the teeth are smooth after use. It is much better than a second-hand product. It says that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels. I don’t know where they are wholesaled from.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand stores again.
Give me a suggestion, why sometimes the listing on Amazon’s app can’t be posted, I hope to improve some apps, and it will do better and better!
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Garbage Excellence has a special delivery time of 19:00-22:00 when placing an order regardless of customer needs.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive the mail at night.
It turned out that it was delivered directly to the door at 12:00 noon, without calling in advance.
If the delivery time is that your courier can deliver it at any time he wants, why bother to make a time for the customer to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then don't do e-commerce at all!
Let an old man with 3 wounds get out of bed and open the door to receive the courier, and he has to find change to pay!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation!
Joyo's so-called complaint customer service is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then give you a so-called answer.
No change or compensation will be made!
I have encountered problems like this before, and I can bear it like the wrong delivery time, but this time I can't bear it, it's too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and the back cover were reversed, so there was an obvious quality problem, so you just closed your eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Leave a bad comment and no one will contact you.
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all!
Won't spend a dime on excellence again.
Picture quality is really unacceptable
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are so blurred that they cannot be recognized.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-format illustration, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many pictures can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files.) What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
! I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.
There is no comment on the text, each family has their own differences.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. I just read and played with boredom. I feel that I should not be addicted to such a book. After all, Qidian’s online articles were not very attractive to me in the past.
Then...it fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and happy. In the first part, when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even the intrigue between the guilds was not heavy at all because of Ye Xiu's blood.
As for the part about the competition, I wrote about the change of times and the alternation of old and new with a little bit of sadness (maybe I am sentimental).
It took me a lot of study time in the second year of high school to read the whole book, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time's descriptions of characters and emotional lines are very amazing. Some characters are only brought in occasionally, and they will leave a deep impact on people. For example, the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian and Su Mucheng have a large number of fans. Characters that are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc. are also very likable. In an e-sports cool article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is a full-time success in character description .
As for the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million beauties in the harem that are criticized by ordinary online articles. They are either beautiful or corrupt. Everyone's feelings in the full text have one thing in common, that is, they like the game of glory, and Most want to win with dignity.
There are small measures but no big conspiracy, everyone looks so innocent and cute.
This may also be why there are no annoying roles full-time.
The full-time IP is huge, and it is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, full-time is still a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood and a little touch.
In April of this year, full-time anime will be made.
In fact, I have been wanting to buy this set of books for a long time. Because my wallet is never thick enough, I didn’t make up my mind to start. Then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on tb. In fact, the full-time recently released another version, the cover picture. I really like it myself, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I checked on Amazon and bought a set at once.
Next, let’s briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●There is no plastic cover for the fourth book, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth book is in the plastic package but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange and it feels not as hard as others.
●The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.
●The publishers of individual books are different. It seems that the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, which is different from the others.
●On the whole, it is quite satisfactory. There are 24 books in a large box, which is very satisfying.
lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but it turned out that there are a lot of words!
I read it three times before I finish reading this book to the children. A little lion who can shoot a gun, a little lion who loves to eat marshmallows.
When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete man.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he went.
Maybe many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the memory of the grown-up children, and if she is reminded of it inadvertently one day, it may touch or inspire her.
Great value for money portfolio
1. I didn’t know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, the reason is that they are too powerful, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.
There have been 3 versions of this work. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, which is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest. It also comes with a book box for two volumes.
Personally, I think it is acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which are easy to read as paperbacks. Second, it is different from Michelangelo’s complete works, which mainly consist of paintings. Da Vinci’s Black and white manuscripts account for the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last supper), but I don’t know if it’s the printing or the size of the book. Some shadows are too deep, and the details can’t be seen clearly. Pity.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter's breadth of research and achievements are not enough to be described as geniuses.
If you could only understand half of Da Vinci by looking at the paintings before, you will be completely speechless after reading the manuscripts.
Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, this is really rubbish, I bought a waste of money, give me a reason!
1. The travel time is inaccurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time returns to zero.
2. Inferior belts are not made of silicone, and the wrists are allergic to blisters.
3. Often can not connect to the mobile phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep detection is not displayed, and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics is too slow
It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but it was only received on the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too bad. Shopping on Amazon is already slow, but I didn't expect it to be so slow!
overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning, but this time it is fine. There is an inflatable bag inside. The three sizes of the camera are the same. It can also be registered on the official website. The number of shutter times is 0. The rest can only be tested by time.
The delivery speed is quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier brother here. The valuables are placed in the concierge, and they go fast. I can't open the box for inspection in front of him. I am really speechless about this.
The merchant has done it for the sake of customers before delivery :)
The merchant is more responsible, calling specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera used, which is indeed for the sake of the customer.
Delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also very suitable and effective.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good. I would like to ask why it is not fully charged after the first charge, and the charging indicator is always red.
At present, there is no official Amazon feedback channel, so I can only give feedback in product reviews.
1. On March 29, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it shows that it will be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon’s official website (because it has not yet been released);
2. The content of the book that was pushed to the device on March 31 is blank, just stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan;
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again, but I cannot get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" that contains the actual content, but I can see that the book can be previewed on Amazon's official website.
I have a few thoughts now
1. The price issue is actually not the most important thing. The key is how to replace the blank books on the kindle with books with actual content, instead of downloading them forever and saying "stay tuned"
2. The pre-purchased book should not be bought again in the future. After all, if the ticket is skipped, and then download a book with empty content, the procedure seems very complicated;
3. I hope that Amazon will provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there will be a place to give feedback (work orders and online customer service are both acceptable, and you can refer to Microsoft’s official mall for how to do it. of)
Not very recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see Write some reflections from memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments about love in life.
The style of this book is extremely flat, the kind of plain water, the choice of words and sentences pursues the ultimate simplicity, and the plot is as quiet and flat as a street in a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a sketch of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally, they were collected together and titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea dryness and rocks in urban legends, and it is not just the glue between you and me. Not only the above should not be represented by the above, love is also a life as plain as water, boring day after day, there is also a loss of life, evasion of reality, and confusion of the future.
As you read this book, you may have in your mind images of the arguing couples around you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unfulfilling relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are boring, unless your life is rough or sweet like living in a candy castle, you will feel strange when you have to read it Not weird and boring.
In terms of the depth of thinking, the daily plots did not catch people's eyes or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short clips did not explore any issues, such as What kind of mistake led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is also the reason for the relatively poor reading experience of this book.
Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not full enough.
It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It just points out the direction but does not give specific methods.
Plus, the book feels like a cobbled together piece.
For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.
I don't know if it is a story compiled for the sake of example, but it will be more convincing if some cases experienced by the author are given.
Change back and forth between customers and customers.
The title is still a customer, but the text becomes a customer.
There were also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.
In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
Quickly understand the guide book of Internet finance
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deep by yourself.
And the book was written earlier, and the later content of Alipay and WeChat’s subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today’s third-party payment share is probably not as small as the book said.
Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad. Therefore, he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write Gao Dakong, but the hard thing is to write it in an easy-to-understand manner.
I appreciate you and want you to know more!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he has received enough attention and appreciation at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after people's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is to satisfy their psychological needs—hoping to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "I love you hard to express", even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it silently in their hearts and will not say it.
In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, desirable gifts, and physical touch.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from your heart to appreciate anytime, anywhere, and to be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate, and companies can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.
Due to reasons such as Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds, there are more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit goods, please review strictly by Amazon
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, no weight, not even as good as street stall products, no weight, no barcode, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose, which is not a characteristic of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a return; It is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart-to-heart, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added a few comparison photos to further verify the fakeness of the product. Clearer references to avoid financial loss and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope that Amazon will be meticulous and strictly control the source of products.
So-so product, not as expected
advantage:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2: The motor and the blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is OK to use, but there is a gap between my expectations.
shortcoming:
1. There is no indicator light for charging, which basically saves your power indicator. It is estimated that customers who buy products worth 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also charity and have no respect.
2. There is a strong smell When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
I tried it in the office for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.
Compared with the PHILIPS of the same price I have used before, although there is an extra cutter head, the quality of this Panasonic product is really sorry for consumers.
Small Package
When I received the express delivery and saw the e-commerce version on it, I knew it had fallen into the pit again. It was smaller than the one bought in the supermarket. It should be M. The packaging is different from the picture on the product introduction. It is called a new version.
The three stars are because I was sloppy and didn't read the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?
E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy when I have time.
Just sauce purple.
don't like the taste
The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste very much, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it. For the time being, this word is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during an event and it was very cheap, so I am too embarrassed to give bad reviews, maybe four stars, but I won’t buy it again.
Authentic yo well packaged
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag inside, and there are no online reviews, only a bare product.
There is still a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast. It arrived the next day after taking the photo.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.
A bad shopping experience
I placed the order on Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and did not receive it. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and said that they did not sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but said that the sender can only initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon's customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of turnaround, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging has been removed, and the product is still intact. I don't know if it was used. No, it's pretty bad anyway
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive a headset like Figure 1, but unexpectedly I received a headset like Figure 2. It’s fine if the pictures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the volume of the left and right earphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay attention to it. In addition, I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.
general operating system
After using it for a period of time, overall the picture is not bad, I can’t feel any difference, but this system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a bit slow, and I can’t make good settings, and the software I bring is not necessary. After commenting, the response speed is even more general, which is not an order of magnitude compared with that of my colleagues.
I read comments that it is very user-friendly design, but I didn’t find any human-friendly design. The commonly used remote control is up, down, left, right, and the position of the back button design is really not flattering.
So, just use it as a TV, and use it with a TV box and the like.
The price cut is too big
The price cut is too big, more than 100 yuan is now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this passage to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when purchasing, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product accordingly.
Low price and good line, this is enough if you don’t have a fever!
It is such a cheap cable, but it should have reached the hdmi certification standard. Compared with the domestic Akihabara bullshit (the price is twice as expensive), the cable body is thick and soft, and the 7-meter transmission has no noise. Look for Baseus for the low price line in the future!
Things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I can't cancel the order. The webpage contact online customer service always shows the wrong link, and I can't get in touch.
After the delivery arrived, the delivery guy called me, and I said I don't want it anymore, but if I wanted to cancel the order, the delivery guy took it back, and said to sign for me first, and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was told that once the food is signed for, it cannot be returned, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service. The same is true, and the sign cannot be returned.
I have bought items from JD.com and Suning that cannot be returned under the policy, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted the customer service and they were refunded, and JD.com’s diapers were too smelly after opening. I contacted the customer service and they still returned it. You can’t do it on Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me that I can either accept it myself, or let the courier buy it by himself. It is not easy for the courier. Why should I let the courier pay for something that I didn't buy?
Okay, I will not refund, I accept it myself, but I have to give 1 point to your service
Advise everyone not to waste money
First of all, I am looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand should not be too bad. After receiving it, I think the packaging is okay, and the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft, which cannot be seen from the outside. , to feel, tasteless in the mouth after eating, bland and tasteless, the flesh around the bite is dark yellow, that is the kind that is broken, good and bad are sold together, and less than one-third of it can be eaten, Advise everyone not to buy, it is not cheap, the quality is too bad!
Gain wisdom by eating a pit, and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark
The corner of the bottom of the bottle is severely dented, which should be caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of ravages is worrying. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it is still purchased internationally. Have you seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs? It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the cap comes out directly. There is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are all foreign products like this?
Being born in China, I don't understand.
It should be genuine, right?
There is also a reminder that it will arrive on the 20th when I took the photo. This one was received on the 14th. This is my first overseas purchase here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?
Pickup service could be improved
I bought a total of 5 delivery coupons. When I picked them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 coupons for the first time, but only 2 coupons were sent. After many communications, it was confirmed that they were missed and they needed to be reissued after I agreed. The second appointment was just in time. On the last rest day, neither the website nor WeChat indicated the need to make an appointment on weekdays, which caused unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.
good shopping
Good stuff!
I still believe in Amazon’s self-operated products. Now it’s very convenient to buy overseas, and the delivery time is only a few days longer than domestic ones. I have to say that Amazon’s customs clearance capabilities for overseas purchases to China are still very strong, which is faster than transshipment. Much faster, so many things are now purchased overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to buy them when you go out and buy them back home. I hope to improve.
Rubbish
Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: Do you think it is rubbish on the side of the road?
A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is like packing garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was very simple. There was no measure to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. When I got it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were also damaged.
If I only come across one like this, I will recognize it and buy a few that are like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and the customer service said that it can be refunded, but the shipping fee will be paid in advance, and then the shipping fee will be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card back. This means that I have to buy your gift card by myself. I have to post the product to the warehouse in Germany. This is not a crime for buying a product!
And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say a word is their responsibility, and dare not even take responsibility for a half sentence. What kind of guarantee is there for such after-sales service? Planted! But I guess my evaluation, Amazon will not give a chance to publish it, so I will delete it directly!
The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics is very poor
1. The quality is very good, the price is moderate, and the price is excellent.
2. Strong, sufficient materials, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. The logistics is flawed. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon didn't mark the expected delivery date as February 7th, I might be very satisfied.
5. But marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user will feel very uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure of making a promise, don't make a promise.
7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by merchants.
8, so, I scored low.
gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious or not depends on the individual or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not so good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade. If you put it on the car, if you move it a few times, there will be some gold dust in your hands and on the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square shape has no decorative effect, so don't put gold wires on it. It will be troublesome if it falls off and stains the car.
The items are in good condition and the speed is OK. They are divided into 2 packages and packaged differently.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is divided into 2 packages for 2 pieces, and the packaging is different. Obviously, one is too shock-proof, with thick cardboard attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to disassemble. The other is domestic. It is like a courier box, and it only takes a few cushioning airbags. , It feels a bit perfunctory.
Airland mattress is really good
The 34CM mattress is not so thick, you can just sleep on the mattress without the bed.
The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, the sleep is very comfortable, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two spots of stains due to violent express delivery. Airland customer service was very responsible, and they contacted and solved the problem efficiently.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless
The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for the after-sales. If there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.
If you want to cancel the order, I’m sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled; if you want to return the product, you have successfully applied for a return on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the product yourself.
What kind of self-operated product is this damn.
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for the after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier" and claimed that it is self-operated. It is shameless, shameless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!
Depressed experience
The filter element I bought online from another store before has a good filtering effect. After 28 days, I use it for an extra day or two and there is no scale.
Since the quality of things purchased on Amazon has been good, this time I thought about buying here. It is the first time to buy a filter element on Amazon. , there will always be small black toner suspended, I really don’t know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away, very depressed~
not as good as expected
Compared with the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, and the internals have not been disassembled. I hope it is as described by the store. From the perspective of ease of use, there is no indication of whether each independent unit is powered on.
The packaging is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is seriously damaged, and the box inside seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new. It was only renovated in September, and the stock is in stock. I hope it will not be broken by then. Please explain why several customers mentioned it The packaging is damaged, but you can deal with it safely, thank you!
Overall good, a little problem
This is the first time I bought a water filter jug. After reading a few evaluation articles, I felt that LAICA was more cost-effective, so I chose this one. I received the product and installed the filter element according to the instructions. The raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the raw water tank is not tightly sealed).
When using, be sure to wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
incomplete picture
The picture does not show the details of the side. The details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body. There is a big difference. This is one. Thirdly; when I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. There was only a simple plastic bag here, and there was no product logo on the beads. How could I judge whether it was true or not.
Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
I placed an order two days ago, and when I received it today, I found that the price was reduced by 40 yuan. It took me a lot of time to find the customer service. The customer service said that I could not make up the difference, and I could re-buy and return the product.
This kind of customer experience and service is really 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure.
It's okay, as a novice, it's worth starting
The quality is decent, not comparable to the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong, and it’s okay.
something good
The item is really good, I gave it to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not around at noon to get the express delivery. The logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send me a verification text message for picking up the package. , caused me to run twice.
But baby is really good.
worth buying
The little monkey is cute, and Amazon offers great discounts. The official website of Chow Sang Sang ships the goods directly. I placed the order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. It's really fast.
Postal couriers are also responsible.
Thumbs up!
A customer's confession
1 If you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that this problem will be dealt with by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You will never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, you don’t know her job number, and there is no direct contact phone number, that is, you can’t contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, the commissioner contacted me. I left my mobile phone for a while, but did not receive a call from the commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours but did not get a call from the specialist. During this period, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the defective coffee machine I received!
5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the United States. The shopping method of overseas shopping is good, but the service compared to the United States and Asia is far worse.
6 For me I just have to keep waiting...
Uneven bottom
Because the comments are very good, everyone is looking forward to this pot. I like it very much when I got it. It is very light, but when I opened the pot, I found a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat. If it is sunken, the oil has gone to the periphery. The specially bought large fat meat in a pot is fried so much oil that it can't cover the central area.
I don’t know if I was unlucky, and I just got a pot with a bad foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot clean and returned it, and I was busy for a long time in vain.
Good product design needs matching manufacturing process to realize
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer turned the top into a slightly curved surface.
It should have been very smooth lines.
It's a pity that the final effect was not realized.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the rear water tank top cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and there is a height difference of up to 2mm after the combination.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the entire sense of design has been destroyed.
I feel sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet able to create products of this level.
(Of course, I can’t ask too much for the feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales said that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has problems, her disapproval and truthful emotions made me I understand that you can't ask too much for Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small. It has been repaired for the second time, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
Good deal after discount, sad for Amazon fake discount
Purchased a week after the baby was born, the insulation is super strong.
There is no trace of heat on the outside of the pot, even if you are not afraid of being scalded, it can effectively protect the temperature from escaping.
The air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature after a night.
Amazon said that there are 320 big discounts for the anniversary event. Later, I found that everyone had 249, 289, 299. I felt cheated instantly, but I went to the supermarket and compared it.
Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting and watching for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 is discounted, and Central Asia overseas purchases are at the same price, so hurry up.
I placed an order on September 2, and it was expected to arrive on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, and the speed is really fast!
The packing box is not big, and the original packaging of Vitamix is directly used, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking it when it is thrown across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new with complete accessories, but the cup shakes so badly on the base that I am afraid that the cup will fly out when the machine is turned on!
I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not as loose as mine.
The accompanying recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I can’t find a Chinese version on the Internet, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. It is estimated that it will arrive in 3 days, and then I will toss it!
Too small, no umbrella cover, and the material is average.
Not a queen size at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is average. 3. It is clearly written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is probably not enough for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without any pressure.
not feeling well
The first is that the box is not very strong, and it will be deformed when you press it. The second is that the rear design prevents the ABS on the box from scratching when it is placed flat. Come out.. Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a bit not smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
Well enough
Advantages: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot fit (it can be a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but there is no lock for the buyer , can not be described as service-oriented.
The overall is okay, I don't know if it is genuine leather
The overall feeling is not bad. I don't know whether it is genuine leather, so I can't make a blind evaluation.
It can hold A4-sized documents, even those with a thickness of more than 80 pages, but it may not be able to hold box-shaped objects that are too thick and hard (not deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag partition is more user-friendly, which is quite good.
It's just that there is a small trachoma on the bottom of the one I got. I don't know if it's my bad character or?
Too lazy to toss back and forth to exchange goods, bear it.
Overall, four stars are worth it.
ForRoyal popular camera strap SLR strap around the world
This strap is designed more scientifically, hanging on the shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft material, unlike other fast gunners who use screws to fix the bottom to hurt the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after sale
The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me an after-sales phone number. After many communications, the part has not been received yet. What is the efficiency of this?
It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair if there is a problem in the future. Friends who are looking forward to the after-sales service should make a detour, it is too much trouble!
Minor flaws, good sound
The headstock is defective, a corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
It's okay, the first face sheet
It has been used for a long time, except that the bass is not coming out, the overall is not bad.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as expected.
When I bought it for the first time, something was wrong, all the lights were blinking, and it didn't work.
I asked for a replacement, but it took three days for the goods to arrive in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.
Calls to the delivery person are not answered.
The courier company said they only had that contact.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
I didn't ask for it, and in the case of delayed delivery, I somehow delayed the delivery according to my request-such a text message came.
Later, I will talk about the transit problem.
Anyway, the extremely poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
Probably won't get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; and the label is very sticky, it is not good for cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off. Friends who buy it for organizing cables should pay attention.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a cardboard box, without any protection measures, and the pen box is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is all on the box when it is torn off.
The six hundred yuan thing is treated like this, a very disappointing shopping.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve on the packaging in the future!
The quality is not good. If it is about writing, it is not as good as 925-25
Let’s praise Tiantian Express first, the air mail is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, which is very good. I just received 925-85. The quality of the pen is excellent, and the style is also very beautiful. The reason why I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The cap can adjust the lead length The place is a little wobbly, personal opinion: 925-25 is smoother than 85.
So become a diehard Amazon fan
I bought it at a super discounted price, but the child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been unpacked, and I tried to apply for a return, and it was picked up for free.
Too awesome.
Returns are not advocated, but such a service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
All future books will be moved to here to buy.
Headphones are skewed and there are noises
This headset is really rubbish, I don't know if there is something wrong with my ears, or this headset is really not as good as before.
I bought a blue one from Xyiyi two years ago. The sound quality is not bad, there is no noise and the bass is also good. After using it for more than two years, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
I also saw a purple one which was pretty good-looking, but I bought this one and opened it today, and I felt something was wrong.
At first I thought it was the sound effect of the song and didn’t think much about it, but after listening to it for a long time, I realized that the problem was very serious. Not only the pitch deviation, but also the bass effect was not as good as my previous one. There was also some noise. Does the purple one I bought have this phenomenon? Or is the manufacturing process of earphones really not working now?
Pretty poor rating, very disappointed.
It must be returned during the day tomorrow.
PS looks good
This AV power amplifier has complicated settings, rough appearance and high heat generation.
The sound will take a while to comment!
I just bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14. I saw that the workmanship is poor.
1. The front panel and the knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input socket on the rear panel and the speaker output terminal are very poor. Just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine, which is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer was sunken. I had to unpack it and restore it by hand. The combination of the top cover and the front panel was loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like an entry-level machine from SONY, just made in Malaysia.
I feel that it is much better for Sony to be an OEM in China than Xiaoma.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat, and the top cover of the two-channel movie for about 2 hours is 40-50°C when you touch it with your hands. I don’t know if the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switching power supplies are mostly used. This stupid big transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony should use a silent fan that actively dissipates heat in the machine. After opening the box, only the large aluminum heat sink on the tube can be seen.

never opened
The battery is active.
I really want to dissect it and see what is in its stomach.
Thinking about it later, if you are disappointed after dismantling it, it would be too unfair to spend so much money; if you are satisfied after dismantling it, it will be difficult to reassemble it, and it will be uncomfortable to use.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of the power, most people will feel guilty when they look at it.
Fortunately, I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can be regarded as half a battery engineer, and I can stand it.
Overjoyed
Before I bought it, I was really unsure, until I opened the package and I felt very positive!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, it felt very flexible and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open qq music.
I was shocked, the sound quality turned out to be surround 3D!
I asked in the physical communication store, about 30 or so, but it is definitely not the Pinsheng brand, it is a miscellaneous brand, so although this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, it is absolutely worth having for the price!
worst online shopping experience
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but the goods were not received until October 12.
Check the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide the express tracking number, so I can't find out where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if I could provide the express tracking number, but there was no reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service. The customer service told the seller's mobile phone number. I called the store again.
Although I was very angry, but because the computer was urgently needed, I didn't tell the seller much. I just sent it to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said not yet, it will be shipped in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said that it would be shipped after five or six in the afternoon, but when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said he didn't send it, and told me that if I was in a hurry, let me order from another store, and if I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
No way, it takes a long time to place an order from another store.
Just ask the seller to ship it quickly.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, I will add comments later.
I just bought it for half a year and haven't used it a few times, and now it has a bad contact. I ask if it can be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it a few times since I bought it.
I just carry it in my business bag and use it a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power was turned on, it was not charging. It was necessary to hold the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hands to charge it.
It is suspected that the interface is poorly connected. I wonder if it can be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon disable EMS!
Five-star product, one-star logistics, average three-star.
I don’t understand why Amazon wants to send EMS. It is recognized in the industry as unreliable. Well, computers are valuables anyway!
After buying, the order shows that it is expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send it from Xiamen to Fuzhou!
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. As a result, I checked the logistics at night without receiving any calls or text messages.
I was instantly shocked!
who I am? where am i Did I really buy this computer?
It's almost doubtful that life is alive!
Finally, I went to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two tracking numbers, but fortunately the item is not lost.
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to send express in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, I just bought it a few days ago and found that the price has been reduced. Bad reviews, the book is not bad, and the price is high. The cpu and graphics card are enough for mainstream online games and quite a few large single machines. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a bit light leaking (ips screen) Common problems), the sound quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), I took it to the after-sales service yesterday to test the hardware, there is no problem, the built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller delivered the goods quickly, and answered all inquiries very quickly. The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer. Not bad, but unfortunately there are no gifts
(By the way, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure to buy keyboard film. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there is a problem with the product, it will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is full of bad words. Let me expose it)
Things are good, platform bureaucracy remains
The quality of the hard disk is very good, and the price/performance ratio is absolutely high. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry and can bear the logistics, it is definitely recommended to buy.
But what I have to say is that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. It has not improved from when I swore I would never use it a few years ago. You will never find out the actual logistics status. The information will always be delivered after a few weeks, and you can never complain. That’s it. bureaucracy!
It has been a few days since the goods were received, and the logistics information is still 10 days later, you will receive the goods!
Logistics worry
When it was delivered like this, not only the packaging was flattened, but also the packaging of electrical appliances was opened. I don’t know if there is any package change.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I checked online, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, how long will it last?
Bought someone else disassembled
The tax of more than 100 for a machine of more than 300 is indeed relatively high. It seems that it is more balanced now that it is more than 600.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape was very wrong, as if it had been disassembled, so I quickly took a photo, and sure enough, it opened as soon as it was torn off. After opening, the cardboard inside was still damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. On the anniversary day, I hurriedly tried it on my husband, but the machine didn’t have any electricity at all. Fortunately, there is no beard stubble in the cutter head. Otherwise, I will return it all the way!
It is unknown whether it will be easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. Like the previous evaluation, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable!
Moderate to upper level of experience
It is almost a top-level electric, and there are many cleaning modes, but few people will change their brushes in different modes every day.
I have used it for half a year without any problems. I brush it every day, and flush it on Monday for more than one week.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, other seemingly compatible issues are the reasons for the overseas version?
I hope to learn Dafa.
very cost-effective
Have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and easy to clean.
3. It is completely possible to DIY haircut and save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
The last time I bought two packs, there were actually two different versions. Originally, the words on the lower left corner of the pack were green, but it turned out that one pack was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat got diarrhea after eating it.
I am not sure whether Amazon's source of goods is fake, or it was replaced by an employee during delivery.
I will buy it again, if it is still a fake, I will find you relevant people to hold it accountable.
It's horizontal!
There are slashes on the Amazon picture, but the result is a horizontal slash, isn’t that a lie?
The effect is not bad
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind the instep.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Addition: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (throw away the shoes and keep the insoles), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it is fake and soft.
2. The instep of my instep is not too high, and the cruciate part is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of the instep.
3. I bought three pairs of clarks overseas, and only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music in my favorites.
Go back and try rockport, if not, you can only go to the ecco physical store.
Shoddy, poor quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that the Prime overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the pictures, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, and 7.5W. The upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser shoes, and a pair of insoles are just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One sole has damaged rubber, and the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the upper. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced. !
I regret it a little!
I bought it for 280 yuan for the event. It is quite a bargain to buy ASICS at this price. Of course, there are lower prices in the comments.
Now let’s talk about the shoes. Advantages: The shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well without being baggy.
The appearance is very good, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, but this time I bought 40.5 shoes, and there is about a thumb's distance from the front of the shoes, but this does not affect anything.
This shoe is very "narrow", although there is still a distance in the front, it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be well ventilated, and it feels hot to wear now.
Press the instep
First of all, the workmanship of the shoes is very good, and it is worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have also bought a few pairs of Amazon's love step, and there has never been a problem, but this pair I refer to the reviews and buy a freshman Size uk7, the length of the upper foot is obviously longer because it is one size larger, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses the back of the foot very hard, and the hiking shoes are very hard, which makes the upper foot very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you have to buy it, you can change the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, so it’s a pity not to use it.
A very perfect shopping!
I am very satisfied and like it very much. There is no doubt that Amazon’s overseas purchases are genuine products, and the quality is also very good. It is of high quality and low price. You can rest assured that you can buy it. The after-sales service is very thoughtful. The door-to-door express delivery is very convenient and safe, and the delivery master is very considerate of customers. Every time, he will remind you to pick up the goods from the express cabinet in time. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
All in all, our whole family likes shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it's been a long time, I still have to complain.
I bought it in a spike in winter, less than 200, and it is useless to keep it at home for a few months.
When I was going to use it in the spring, I found that I couldn’t connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals expressed their support for each other. Later, I found out that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I still couldn’t connect to other devices.
I called Amazon and asked me to contact the agency, and the agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back intact, even the express box was the one I used to send it over!
There is no reply, receipt or test report!
Anyway, tell me whether it is good or bad!
I called to ask, and said that sending it back in this way means that there is no problem with the equipment, which is good.
But why I still can't connect, the agency replied: That's not their business.
I'm unlucky, I'm too lazy to be tossed by you for a 200 yuan thing.
Seriously wrong.
Very out of stock.
The headband material is good.
Much better than nike.
Breathability is also very good.
Just the cap on the front.
very fine.
Are you here for a joke?!
Completely out of the sun.
No returns because it functions well as a headband.
Although it can't cover the sun if it is worn upwards.
But it is different from other headband styles.
Save it.
The quality of the product is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of the contract, and the delivery guy is very good.
I request delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon's regulations cannot deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
It made me drive 200 kilometers from other places to come back to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery guy was very positive and enthusiastic.
give a thumbs up!
Product, just tried it, it's not bad.
But I haven't bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is not bad, but the logistics is too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL. This time Apex is really... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low. I feel that the grade is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?
In fact, they are all the same, so overseas shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall and 68KG. My shoulder width is usually 180. I bought M, and the hem is slightly longer. Others fit well. I see that S size is recommended. Are you so slender? Still like tight fit? I think the hoodies should be looser.
Just the right size
Bust 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before buying and was told that I should buy the xxl one, and then read the reviews and decided to buy the L one. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost cheated.
The price of Double Eleven is much more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The most affordable product problem is troublesome!
The order was placed on the 18th and the goods were received on the 25th. The speed from Guangzhou to Beijing is a snail!
I bought the most affordable product, and it was told in the description that there were scratches, but after receiving the product, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child was unwilling to return the product, thinking it was not a big problem, but the child's grandfather ran to several nearby hardware stores and couldn't buy such small parts as accessories!
Finally, grandpa glued it on!
It seems that I will not be able to buy the most affordable products in the future!
Toy processing quality is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, and it is very laborious to install the bolts. It can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I don’t know how long it can be played, because it is something promised to the child, so it will not be returned.
Other reviews said it was easy to install, so is this the only one I bought that has a problem?
very average
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is too old; the workmanship is very ordinary; there is only one kind of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just shaking your head and walking forward without any change.
Not worth the price.
Urgent use, no return.
The quality of the toy is good, let me complain about the packaging
I received the courier yesterday. I bought it from Amazon. It was marked as EMS delivery. In the end, it was delivered by Tmall’s courier. How many turns did it take? Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Let’s talk about the packaging again. It’s just wrapped in plastic wrap for a few layers. There’s not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good and there are no broken parts. , It is much smaller than imagined, because it is not equipped with a battery, and it often derails when pushing it by hand. It feels that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the design is unreasonable.
good quality and fun
It is very fun, the components are of high precision, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to that of Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The process of assembling is very interesting. I will do it, and my 5-year-old son will come to play. It is very good.
He was amazed and laughed again and again ~ he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good
I checked it out for Christmas. The one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a bit slower now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect the poke ball, you will send a dream.
Playing well, it is more portable than ps4.
Already bought Zelda, waiting for the game to try again.
Produced bad goods, sold bad goods, turned out to be bad goods service, bought six watches to give to children, one of them showed incomplete numbers, and the time of the six watches was not consistent, with a difference of more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a checking time for the watch when it is put into storage? They replied "yes". It sounds ugly, look, the obvious quality problems (the numbers are not completely displayed) are all sold out, are they rubbish?
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and complained that they should not have bought their products at the beginning. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
In short, I suggest not to buy things from this seller, it is also rubbish.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, inspection found:
1. The watch packaging is seriously worn out.
2. The instruction manual of the watch has serious use wrinkles.
3. The watch does not run, and the desk lamp is not used for charging, so the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, and the postage will be paid later.
5. The reason for 2 points is that the customer service service is not bad.
just passable
The time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day, and it has been more than two minutes after only a few months of use.
I have used a piece of Citizen before, and I feel that it will not be a few seconds behind in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is a bit tasteless, and it is basically not used. Occasionally, it will enter the timing mode by mistake.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not need to worry about replacing the battery, it has world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easy to scratch and get dust.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, and it can be purchased overseas for more than 180 (it takes about 1 week).
very satisfied watch
It must be authentic. I went to the counter to inspect the goods. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, and it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. Those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches cannot compare. This one is genuine.
The time of the watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the packaging of the watch, and there is a real diamond on the 12 number on the dial.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the night of September 23rd, my wife dropped her mobile phone. On a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock, but it was not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since the non-self-operated delivery is relatively slow, the system shows that it is expected to be the latest Delivery is due September 27th.
My wife was so uncomfortable without a mobile phone. The next morning at 6:00 a.m., I was asked to think about a solution. Later, I went to Jingdong and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered on the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying a new one, I thought about canceling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called the customer service after 7 o'clock and asked to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it has been cancelled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I just waited patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status and had not been delivered. I immediately contacted the customer service and asked to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3:00 p.m., I checked the order on my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact the customer service again to make it clear that it was the third call. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to deliver the goods!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller is not familiar with the system and will cancel the order after getting familiar with the system.
But tell me clearly that the seller already knows, and will never ship, please rest assured.
When I looked at the order display on Monday, it had already shipped, and I was also speechless.
Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The subsequent processing was almost speechless. Basically, I said a step, and the customer service continued to operate.
The order is still in the delivery rejection status so far, and is preparing to send it again!
Wouldn't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
It doesn't matter if the seller's company has collected the money anyway and doesn't follow up.
To sum up, there will never be prepayment for large items in the future. This is too troublesome.

When external energy is injected into an energy level system by means of electric field, photon, chemical, etc. and absorbed, it will cause electrons to jump from low energy level to high energy level. When electrons of high energy level are induced, these high energy level electrons will be induced to move to a lower energy level and release photons (so called stimulated radiation). Waiting will be the same, when these photons of stimulated radiation meet other electrons that have jumped to a higher energy level due to external energy, more photons of the same type will be produced again, and finally the intensity of the light will become greater and greater (that is, the energy of the light is magnified), and the difference with ordinary light is that all photons have the same frequency, phase (coherence), and forward direction.

The difference from the State Duma lies in the department under the jurisdiction of the political party. The committee clearly shows that no political party exists in the upper house.

Instead, the bills are easier to pass after debates with the chairman or committees, and the members themselves are asked not to reflect the original ideology of the political party. The reformed committees in 2000 It is obvious that it has to move closer to the Kremlin authorities,

Traditional digital modulation and labor division use frequency division and frequency division to transmit different information through different frequency bands. OFDM divides an entire frequency band into several sub-carriers, and makes each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, making them The frequency spectrum does not overlap with each other, which can reduce interference. Its operation method places the signal in the frequency domain (frequency domain) at the transmission end, and converts it to the time domain (time domain) through the inverse Fourier transform (IDFT), and After adding the cyclic prefix (cyclic prefix) and sending it out, the receiving end removes the cyclic prefix from the signal, and then converts the time-domain signal back to the frequency domain through Fourier transform (DFT) to extract the original transmitted signal.

Chapter One
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a good person.
His family lives in a little-known northern town. If Beijing plans to build a 20th ring and 30th ring, it can barely be regarded as the foot of the emperor. In the world, no one knows me when I walk on the road. I have passed twenty years with a square face that looks ordinary except for a bit of masculinity. The goal of life is to be a good person, and there is no other special feature—— — This is him.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, walking on the road under the sun during the day can make people feel very irritable. Therefore, in the busy city center, you can see all kinds of vehicles rushing everywhere, but you can't see many pedestrians. Walking outside, the tall young man with an ordinary face wearing a white T-shirt and gray trousers was one of the few pedestrians.
Hao Ren felt that students these days were becoming more and more unprofessional. When he was working outside to hand out folders, he would never give such things to men who could be seen as bachelors at a glance, but no matter what, This kind of hard folding fan is quite suitable.
"The last two, let's just forget about it." Hao Ren muttered as he looked at the last two job advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, these two places were next to each other, and he could quickly finish today's "task", and one of them is In the front is an advertising company that can't be seen from the outside, but the signboard at the door is resounding: Yinhe Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company, once you hear the name, it will be sold within half a year. Hao Ren was It was just for this name, the main purpose was not to apply for a job, but to see how amazing the boss of the company who could come up with such a magical name would be.
He happily walked several hundred meters before bypassing the road barrier, and then ran to the door of this advertising company with a particularly awesome name under the sun, and was surprised to find that the company had indeed closed down. The signboard is still up, but there is a notice of closing down on the glass door, the date is two days ago, and the recruitment notice in his hand is four days ago... This is really a world that is constantly changing with each passing day, and companies are closing down these days In the first two days, do you want to recruit two new employees by the way?
He casually rolled up the advertising company's recruitment notice and threw it into the trash can on the side of the road. Hao Ren looked down at the last one, and two seconds later he also balled it up and threw it into the same place, while reflecting on himself Was it blind when I was screening this thing two days ago? The bus company recruited an office clerk, who was required to be between 25 and 40 years old, who could bear hardships and stand hard work, understand computers and have work experience. Female gender.
Holding this thing in his hands, he came to the city center with great interest, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising company that was busy recruiting workers two days before its closure, he was so full.
Hao Ren, male, female, aged 25 years, has no sexual hobbies, the advantage is that he is not picky about food, currently single, few relatives and friends, living alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city south of the city , like most young men, his goal in life is to earn more than 10,000 yuan a month at the age of twenty-five, marry a beautiful wife, and have a car if possible. Parents can no longer be filial, so at least You have to live well enough so that you don't feel ashamed of your family. Now this series of life goals has been completed by one-third: he is twenty-five this year.
It's such a sad story.
He came to the city today to find a job, but in fact he has no urgent need for a source of income: As mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents, and he should be grateful to the older generation The family property left by the person, at least this house is quite big-it is a two-story old-fashioned house, which has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been renting out his house to make a living, but because the place he lives in is so remote, it is even so remote that even if he wants to wait for the old house to be demolished, he may have to plan for several ten years.
In all fairness, with such a stable income, Hao Ren doesn't need to come out and look for a job, but this person is a bit pretentious when he has too much free time. The reason - my old house is too remote, to the extent that it is almost out of human civilization. Since the last couple of migrant workers moved out of the rental house, no one has rented a house for half a year. In the empty two-story "apartment" for several months, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart: Unless the municipal planning is tilted in his favor, the only way to survive is to come out and look for a job.
After studying the urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought that it was very unlikely that the surrounding area of his home would become a commercial center overnight. Considering that as a gentleman, he could not just waste himself on this, he finally decided to find a job first. At least he has income to maintain his life.
How can I say that I was also a hardworking and good man who worked part-time to earn tuition back then, can he still starve himself to death if he is bright?
But fate doesn't depend on people's will, so he ran around outside the first day basically... there was nothing left but running around.
It was useless to think so much, Hao Ren stretched his waist, and decided to take a break under the shaded benches in the small park by the roadside, and wait for the hottest hour at noon before going to a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then Go home by car.
Even though the economy is developing very fast, the place can still maintain a little bit of leisure and openness in a small place. He found a piece of paper and wiped the bench clean, then lay down sloppily, covered his face with the fold-out page with the logo of the Women's Hospital and beautiful girls to block the sun, and just rested indifferently.
But just as he lay down for less than a minute, the sunlight shining through the edge of the fold had dimmed, as if someone had come to him. Hao Ren revealed his face slightly unexpectedly, and was shocked to find that the sun was already setting in the sky, and a petite and slender female figure was standing next to him. He couldn't see the woman's appearance clearly, and could only confirm through a dim silhouette that she was a slender girl with short hair.
"Yo, are you awake?"
At this time, the strange girl seemed to have finally realized that she was standing against the light so that people could not see her appearance clearly, so she grinned and turned slightly sideways so that the other party could see her appearance clearly.
A very beautiful girl - this was Hao Ren's first impression.
This familiar girl has short hair with a shawl. She may like sports very much. Her skin is slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine. The big eyes were more vibrant than any pair of eyes Hao Ren had ever seen, as if the energy of the whole person was coming from these eyes.
And behind her was a large suitcase that looked quite heavy.
Looking at Hao Ren who was a little dazed, this beautiful girl with short hair burst into an unprecedentedly bright smirk (although it seems a bit inappropriate to say this, but Hao Ren really thinks it is a smirk), that smile is clean and pure, and it seems that these days It is rare to see it on the faces of girls of the same age. The other party fumbled for a long time in the small bag that he carried, and finally took out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: "Excuse me, may I ask you?" Do you know where this place is?"
Hao Ren patted his face to wake himself up. Regardless of what happened to this reckless girl, he looked down at the address on the paper... Hey, isn't this my home when I go?
Chapter 1
The twilight of the early morning pierced the dark blue sky, and the vast sky was pale with fish belly.
In Xianyu County, Wu Zong Academy, in the back mountain forest, a skinny young man in a loose martial robe squatted down with his tongue against his teeth, concentrated all his strength on his left and right fists, and hit a thick tree.
The boxing method is smooth, retractable and retractable, the inner strength is contained but not vomited, the hardness is soft, and it is already a bit hot.
The boy's name is Su Yu, he is fourteen years old, he is delicate and handsome, his figure is tall and straight, and he is still childish.
With black hair fluttering, a pair of eyes as vast as the stars and as deep as the starry sky of the ages, showing wisdom that does not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun hung high.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at the blood-stained fists, and sighed softly: "I worked twice as hard as others, but the results I gained were not half as good as those with the best qualifications."
"Come to another world, I really don't know, is it a blessing or a curse?"
Two months ago, Su Yu took a plane and unfortunately had an air crash. When he woke up, he found that he had traveled to a world called Shenyue Continent.
Become a student of a certain Wu Zong Academy in the mainland.
It took him two full months to digest the memory of the original owner.
In the Shenyue Continent, martial arts are respected, the weak are preyed upon by the strong, and they are cruel and strict.
Human beings practice martial arts, reach the pinnacle, and reach the realm of transcendence and sanctification.
Martial arts are divided into nine levels, and each level has three levels: small success, great success, and peak.
Going beyond the ninth level of martial arts and breaking the shackles, you will become a god and a mythical figure, known as the "holy king in the world".
The realm of a sage king in the world is the ultimate in martial arts, the limit pursued by hundreds of millions of human beings.
Rumor has it that the sage king in the world can move mountains and fill seas, fly clouds and ride fog, and is omnipotent.
A sage king in the world is enough to change the fate of a dynasty for a hundred years, and he is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to cultivate in the world?
Su Yu is the top genius of Qingshan Town under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At the age of only fourteen, he has cultivated to the peak of the first level of martial arts and has become a century-old genius in the hearts of everyone in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was recruited by the Wuzong Academy in Xianyu County, which surpasses everything, Su Yu realized what a frog in a well he was.
Wu Zong Academy collects all geniuses in Xianyu County and collects them once a year.
And he, among all the geniuses in Wu Zong Academy, is just at the bottom!
Wu Zong Academy divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Gold students, geniuses at an excellent level, are often the best in a city, and the top geniuses who suppress other geniuses in the city will be specially trained by Wuzong Academy.
Silver student, a potential level genius, in a small town, has superior talent, with a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a student of Baiyin. He understands very well that in fact, students of Baiyin have no hope of cultivating to great success, but it is a pity to give up.
Silver students are not favored. The training resources given by the school are very limited, and the possibility of getting ahead is close to zero.
"Su Yu, hurry back to the school, Duke Qin summoned you!" An urgent voice cut through the silence of the mountains and forests, and a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain panting, with a look of anxiety on his face.
"Qin Guogong, how can you be negligent? Follow me!" The middle-aged man in blue was impatient, stepped forward and clasped Su Yu's shoulders, ignoring the pain of Su Yu's thin body, and quickly grabbed him down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted his teeth, endured the severe pain in his shoulder, and remained silent.
The middle-aged man in blue is the deacon of the school, managing daily student activities. In the words of the earth school, he is the teaching director.
After half a cup of tea.
The academy, a luxurious and elegant lounge as delicate as a dream.
Only core students, high school seniors, and dignitaries can rest here. Other than that, gold students and silver students are not eligible.
It was also the first time for Su Yu to come to the luxurious lounge, and ordinary poor boys might feel nervous when they came here. But Su Yu was a business elite in his previous life. He was a frequent visitor to five-star hotels, presidential suites, and luxurious balls.
In the lounge, there are three people, a pair of young men and women, and a man with a noble temperament and extraordinary majesty.
When his eyes swept over the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu's eyes paused for a moment.
It was a woman with a pretty face like an elf, her jade face was as delicate as a sculpture, her skin was as fair as spring snow, her figure was exquisite, she was dressed in spotless white clothes, she looked like a fox fairy, very beautiful.
However, the way she looked at Su Yu was cold and complicated.
Beside him, is a sixteen-year-old boy, handsome, handsome and martial, indescribable.
"Hehe, I'm Qin Guogong. It's a pleasure to meet you." Qin Guogong, one of the three Dukes of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, did not have any arrogance, but was very kind, and smiled and asked Su Yu to sit down.
Su Yu shook his head coldly in his heart, not being moved by the kindness at all.
People in high positions attract the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and their own image.
Just like the politicians on the earth, they are clearly in conflict, but after meeting, they still shake hands and greet each other with a smile on their faces, and they only stab knives under the stage and do black hands.
"I'm Qin Feng's father. This time, I'm here because of the matter between him and Qing'er." Qin Guogong's handsome face revealed a gentle smile, "I've heard Feng'er tell you everything about it. Regarding this, as Feng'er's father, I would like to express my gratitude to you." You apologize."
Bitterness flashed in Su Yu's heart, it was the bitterness of another Su Yu's remnant soul. The girl in front of her, named Jiang Xueqing, is a genius who came out of Qingshan Town together with Su Yu, and was enrolled as a student of Wu Zong Academy at the same time.
The two are childhood sweethearts, childhood sweethearts, golden boy and jade girl, a match made in heaven.
However, after entering Wu Zong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small village, was shocked by the huge and prosperous world, and gradually became fascinated by the glitzy world.
With her beauty like a fox fairy, it is inevitable that she will be sought after by young dignitaries and handsome geniuses.
In the beginning, she could still convince herself to stick to her heart and spend the first school year with Su Yu.
But, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, and gradually transformed from a naive little girl, knowing that Su Yu would hardly have a future in the future. If she followed her, she might suffer and suffer, and become a servant.
Finally, her inner defenses were loose.
Two months ago, he completely cut off contact with Su Yu and became the son of Duke Qin, the partner of Duke Qin Feng.
Although Jiang Xueqing abides by her duties as a good girl and has never overstepped the relationship between men and women, but since then, the two have often accompanied each other, inseparable, and have become the enviable fairy couple in everyone's eyes.
And Su Yu became the laughing stock of Wu Zong Academy.
Su Yu was hit so badly that he begged Jiang Xueqing to change his mind many times. He knelt down to beg and begged, losing all face, but Jiang Xueqing refused indifferently.
Su Yu couldn't bear the great tragedy of life, so he threw himself into the lake. It just so happened that Su Yu on Earth had a plane crash, and his soul traveled to him, a pathetic and pitiful weakling.
Seeing that Su Yu fell into memories, Qin Guogong thought that he couldn't let go of his friendship with Jiang Xueqing, and sighed: "Feng'er is young and ignorant. I am willing to pay compensation for his faults. You can ask for anything you want, but, as a father, I hope you can make Feng'er perfect. He is serious about Miss Xueqing."
Hearing Qin Guogong's words that seemed to come from the heart, Su Yu shook his head secretly in his heart. This kind of trick is okay to deceive ordinary people, but it is useless to him.
You stole my girlfriend and let me be fulfilled? This is not an apology, it's clearly using power to overwhelm others!
Qin Guogong seems to have a gentle attitude, but in fact it is full of naked insults.
Let me ask, if it is the monarch's woman, the emperor's woman, who is favored by his son, would he, Qin Guogong, dare to ask the monarch to give up his woman to Qin Feng? He didn't dare, because he couldn't offend the monarch, he could only offend a commoner like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head lightly, got up and wanted to leave, he had no nostalgia for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing, even if Duke Qin didn't use power to overwhelm her, he didn't intend to compete for her.
As for Qin Guogong's so-called compensation, although Su Yu lacks cultivation resources, even though he is a poor boy, even though he has nothing. However, he still has a will to not admit defeat, and he has not yet fallen to the point of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understands the character of "Su Yu", and is stubborn and unwilling to admit defeat. Seeing that he wants to leave, she only thinks that he still refuses to give up. She bites her silver teeth lightly, moves her lotus steps lightly, and her snowy eyes are like the glint of the cold moon: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!"
"Since it's today, I'll speak out thoroughly, and I hope you can give up." Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed coldness.
"Qin Fenggui is the Duke of a small country, and he will surely be the pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me glory and wealth, but you, a poor boy from a mountain village, can you give me?"
"Qin Feng is respected as a gold student. In the future, he will catch up with the holy king of the world and stand above hundreds of millions of people. It can give me a sense of security. You, a silver student, can you give me?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality. I don't deny that you used to be my nostalgia and the most dazzling genius in my mind, but that was because I was too young and too innocent. The real world is cruel and real. I have nothing else to say. choose!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in her eyes, stared at Su Yu, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, and sighed softly: "Brother Feng is very kind, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try his best to make up for you. I will give you a few Melting Spirit Pills to boost your cultivation. Your strength will improve, and your life in school will be much easier."
After thinking for a while, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
Crystal clear, shining with gorgeous deep luster. The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a fairy, so fascinating.
The statue looks like a woman, lifelike, no different from its owner, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the gift you gave me as a promise of love. Now, I will return it to you. We will never owe each other." Jiang Xueqing ruthlessly stuffed the statue into Su Yu's hand, turned back to Qin Feng's side, and looked out into the sky. Don't look at Su Yu anymore, cold and heartless.
"Chi Yao, I treat you like my true love, why did you kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared, and wanted to pounce forward, so that the gilt-cast bed creaked, and he sat up suddenly.
After realizing that it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen let out a long breath and wiped the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve.
No!
That was not a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of "Emperor Ming", one of the nine emperors in the Kunlun Realm. He was only sixteen years old, and with a physique that defies the sky, he cultivated to the Great Perfection of the Heavenly Realm.
However, when he became the first person of the younger generation in the Kunlun world, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart, his fiancée Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of one of the nine emperors, "Qingdi".
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing are best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao are even more intimately married. They grew up together and practiced together.
A heroic figure, a peerless beauty, who can be called a golden boy and a jade girl, could have become a good story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen never expected that Princess Chi Yao would attack him!
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found that he was already eight hundred years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao quelled the chaos of the Nine Emperors, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the master of the entire Kunlun Realm—Queen Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors who ruled the Kunlun Realm have completely become the past and disappeared in the long river of history.
The Nine Emperors are dead, and the Empress will be established.
In this era, there is only one emperor, and that is Empress Chi Yao, who rules the world and is in all directions.
"Why did she kill me?
How can her heart be so cruel, or is it that women's hearts are so cruel? Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart was heavy, and he was full of questions. However, no one could help him answer them.
Eight hundred years have passed, and the sea has changed, things have changed, and people have changed, except for the peerless Empress Chi Yao, who is still young and immortal.
All those old people who used to be turned into loess and bones. Even the majestic Nine Emperors of the past have all disappeared in the world, leaving only a section of glorious stories that will be passed down for generations.
"Squeak!"
A frail and beautiful woman in palace attire came in from the outside, looked at Zhang Ruochen who was sitting on the bed, with concerned eyes, "Chen'er, are you having nightmares again?"
The beautiful woman in front of her is the concubine of Prince Yunwu and Zhang Ruochen's mother, Concubine Lin.
The original owner of this body died on the bed three days ago because of his frail health.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the boy who had died of illness back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body was also named Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen just woke up, he still rejected Concubine Lin very much.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Concubine Lin was just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually discovered that Concubine Lin really cared about him and cared for him in every possible way. Seeing Zhang Ruochen awakened from a nightmare, she rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room immediately regardless of the cold weather.
In the previous life, Zhang Ruochen had never met his biological mother. It is said that she died when she was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body, which gave him an extra mother and felt the warmth of a mother's love. "Perhaps she still doesn't know that her own Chen'er died of illness three days ago!"
If she was told the truth, she might not be able to bear the blow of this bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and he smiled slightly: "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream."
Concubine Lin was wearing a maroon hooded mink fur on her thin body. She was sitting beside Zhang Ruochen's bed, stroking Zhang Ruochen's forehead, and said worriedly: "It's been three nights, and you are always woken up by nightmares. She is called 'Chi Yao' every time. Who the hell is she?"
It is naturally impossible for Concubine Lin to associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun realm and established the First Central Empire, she was known as the "Empress of Great Virtue and Virtue". No one dared to mention the word "Chi Yao" at ordinary times.
Will make a taboo. Zhang Ruochen said: "It's nothing, mother, you heard it wrong!"
Concubine Lin sighed, and said: "From now on, don't call the word 'Chi Yao' directly, even in your dreams, that's the empress's name. Calling the empress by her name is disrespectful. , will be executed."
Zhang Ruochen nodded, squeezed his fingers tightly, and said meaningfully: "Absolutely not!"
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, feeling extremely sad in her heart.
Although he was born in the family of the county king, he has been weak and sick since he was a child. He is already sixteen years old and can only lie in bed all year round. I am afraid that he will only be like this in this life!
Outside, there was a sound of messy footsteps.
"What are you doing?
A beautiful maid wanted to stop the Hachi Prince who barged in, but was gently pushed by the Hachi Prince and fell more than ten meters away. The Eighth Prince is a martial artist, whose cultivation has reached the late stage of Huangji Realm. With one palm strike, it is enough to knock a stone plate weighing 300 jins ten feet away, let alone a maid who weighs 100 jins?
With a flick of a finger, she could be sent flying.
The maid screamed and fell heavily to the ground, her left arm was broken.
The Eighth Prince was wearing a gold-threaded robe, with a jade belt wrapped around his waist. His body was muscular, his arms were slender, and his steps were steady. He walked into the Yushu Palace and stared at the maid coldly. I really want to die."
Behind the eighth prince, there were six guards wearing forest leather armor. They were tall and sturdy. They were obviously powerful martial arts monks, belonging to the royal palace's imperial guards.
After Concubine Lin heard the commotion outside, she calmed down Zhang Ruochen, then closed the door and walked out.
She stared at the eighth prince standing outside, frowned slightly, and said: "His Royal Highness, this is the Yushu Palace, even if you are a prince, you can't intrude!"
The eighth prince, Zhang Ji, raised his head and stared at Concubine Lin, and said in a loud voice: "The queen has ordered that the bedroom of Concubine Lin and the ninth younger brother be changed to the 'Ziyi side hall'. From now on, the master of Yushu palace will be my prince's biological mother Xiao Empress Dowager."
Concubine Lin's complexion changed slightly. She had expected this day to come, but she never thought it would come so soon.
Concubine Lin smiled miserably, and said, "Is the Queen going to drive our mother and son out of Yushu Palace so soon? Alright!
Mother said that she wanted to settle in Yushu Palace tonight. Concubine Lin please move to the side hall now! "
The Eighth Prince sneered coldly, and said unceremoniously: "Concubine Lin, there are a lot of poor people in this world, but not everyone deserves to be pitiful. Since the ninth brother is weak and sick, why are you still living in this world?"
"He's your ninth brother!"
Concubine Lin wanted to say something more, but suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hands on the doorpost, staring at the Eighth Prince who was not far away.
His seemingly weak body seemed to contain an unyielding will, and said: "Don't ask them, we will move out now."
"Chen'er, why did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, so hurry back." Concubine Lin hurried forward to support Zhang Ruochen, lest he catch the cold.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes and seemed to be infected by his emotions, she nodded with tears in her eyes.
Concubine Lin and Shen supported Zhang Ruochen and walked out of Yushu Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eighth Prince and broke her arm.
None of the other servants left Yushu Palace with them. Everyone could see that Concubine Lin and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power. In the county palace, it was difficult for them to gain a foothold.
Originally they were the servants of Yushu Palace, but now they chose to stay in Yushu Palace wisely, and all went to curry favor with the new master, the Eighth Prince.
Ziyi side hall is usually the place where princesses who have fallen out of favor live. It is very remote, and the ground is full of fallen leaves. It seems that no one has lived there for a long time.
The night was deep, and the wind was cold and bleak.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, but he still felt the cold.
"This physical body is too weak, only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am the son of the county king now, I can still only be manipulated by others. "Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen doesn't know where he can go now?
Since God arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it is for revenge against Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for the mother who took care of him in every possible way, he must become stronger. The humiliation and cold reception I have suffered today is all because I am too weak to resist, unable to control my own destiny, and even the place where I live has been taken by others.
If you want to gain the respect of others and obtain a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your ability.
In the Kunlun world, if you want to become a warrior, you must first activate the "Martial Imprint".
The so-called "Martial Imprint" is the qualification given by the gods to human beings to practice martial arts.
Those who have not activated the "Shenwu Seal" will never be able to cultivate true energy, and will not be able to become a strong man between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruochen is already sixteen years old, and he still hasn't activated the "Shenwu Seal".
After the age of sixteen, one would miss the best age for practicing martial arts. Even if the "Shenwu Mark" is activated, it is impossible to achieve much.
They are also the sons of Yunwu County King, why can the Eighth Prince be superior to others? Can Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin be driven out of Yushu Palace?
It is because the Eighth Prince activated the "Shenwu Mark" when he was ten years old, and he is now a young warrior in the late Huangji Realm.
"As long as I activate the 'Shenwu Seal', I can practice the "Jiutian Mingdi Sutra".
With the mysteries of the "Jiutian Mingdi Sutra", even if I have missed the best training age, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts expert again. "The "Jiutian Mingdi Sutra" is the supreme treasure of Emperor Ming's cultivation. Apart from Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the "Jiutian Mingdi Sutra".
"Tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony. I hope to get the approval of the gods and activate the 'Shenwu Seal'."
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists, eager to open the "Shenwu Seal".
After Concubine Lin tidied up the room, she came to help Zhang Ruochen, "Chen'er, you should go to bed early! Tomorrow, I have to go to the sacrificial ceremony."
"Mother, don't worry, I will definitely be able to open the 'Shenwu Seal' tomorrow!" Zhang Ruochen said.
"Um!
Concubine Lin took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen, and sighed softly in her heart.
Chapter One
With a bang, a rusty iron door was opened, and the lingering sound of the iron door was blocked by the surrounding ancient buildings, lingering endlessly.
After a dozen or so breaths, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out of the iron gate by the arms of two jailers. The young man with his head drooping seemed to be out of breath, and even his arms were so thin that only bones remained. From the blood-stained and tattered clothes on his body, it can be seen what kind of torture and torture this young man has suffered.
The thin man "Peng" was thrown on the ground by two jailers, some dust was splashed, and then there was no movement.
"Shouldn't this kid be dead?" A chunky jailer asked while staring at the young man who was lying motionless on the ground.
Another jailer hummed, "He should be dead, who dared to be rude to Miss Jian. Now, not only is the Ning Mansion destroyed, but he himself has been liberated, and he deserves it."
"Old Hui, be careful what you say, we'll drag him out and deal with it first." The chunky jailer quickly warned.
Hearing the short and fat jailer's words, the other jailer named Lao Hui shrank his head involuntarily, and was about to pull up the lifeless man on the ground and prepare to drag him away.
At this moment, a somewhat weak voice shouted from the side, "Brothers, I want to take my husband away."
Only then did the two talking jailers see a woman in coarse linen clothes standing on the side. Although this woman was wearing coarse linen clothes, she could still vaguely see her decent demeanor. The only regret is that her face has been disfigured and covered by slightly messy hair, which makes people reluctant to take a second look.
Both guards recognized who this woman was, and she was one of the only two survivors in the Ning family.
Ning Gao is the housekeeper of the Ning Mansion. When the Ning Mansion was ransacked, he left Cangqin to have an accident abroad, so he escaped. And this woman is the daughter-in-law of the Ning Mansion, and also the wife of this thin man who was just thrown out of prison, named Ji Luofei.
She escaped the catastrophe because she stayed at Cangqin Two-Star Academy. Of course, this is also because Ji Luofei has little connection with the Ning family. The reason why she married into the Ning family is because the Ning family and the Ji family are family friends. She and Ning Cheng have been engaged since childhood. It's just that the Ji family fell down in the most inexplicable way, and in the end there was only a disfigured Ji Luofei left.
Even so, Ning Cheng's grandfather Ning Hongchang still took Ji Luofei into the mansion. He planned to wait for Ning Cheng to gather his energy before marrying the two of them.
"Okay, okay, drag it away, it's ugly to put here." The chunky jailer put away the silver coins, waved his hand impatiently and said.
They were going to dispose of Ning Cheng's body, but they never thought that someone would come to dispose of it and return the silver coins. Of course, they would not refuse such a good thing.
When Ji Luofei heard this, she quickly carried Ning Cheng on her back, accelerated her speed, and soon disappeared from the prison gate.
"If this Ji Luofei hadn't been disfigured, she would still be a beauty." Looking at Ji Luofei's back, another jailer tossed the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
"Stop talking nonsense, Ji Luofei is also a member of Cangqin Two-Star Academy anyway, no matter how ugly she is, it won't be our turn." The short and fat jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder, and pulled him into the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled an extremely pleasant fragrance, and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng realized that he was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance came from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a bad mood, and ended up going the wrong way, walking up to the elevated road alone. Then a yellow light from the sky hit him, and then there was nothing else.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? What exactly is going on?
As soon as Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, all kinds of information flooded into his mind, and he was reborn.
What shocked Ning Xiaocheng was that his reborn body was originally called Ning Cheng. The reason why he was horrified was because his original name was also Ning Cheng.
It's just because he often had a nightmare, that is, he saw himself coming to a very strange place, being imprisoned by someone, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed his name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, after turning around, he still called Ning Cheng, and he was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead, but the woman who was carrying him looked back and didn't say much.
"Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk." Ning Xiaocheng said apologetically when the woman looked back at him.
"The Ning family is gone, you are very lucky to be alive." The woman's tone was calm, as if Ning Xiaocheng was really dead, she would still have this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent, he had sorted out some bits and pieces of information just now. He should have called Ning Cheng back again now, he is the only member of the Ning family in Cangqin Kingdom.
Ning Cheng's parents went to Mango Sea Area to look for spiritual objects when Ning Cheng was very young, and never came back. Ning Cheng has been following his grandfather Ning Hongchang to live in Cang Le City, the capital of the Cang Qin Kingdom. Although the Ning Mansion is large, there are not many people.
Of course Ning Cheng became the number one person in the Ning Mansion, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ning Cheng. All the bad things Ning Cheng did in Cangle City were taken care of by Ning Hongchang. Cangle City is full of relatives of princes and nobles. Although Ning Hongchang is also the elder of Cangqin Kingdom, he is not as good as those relatives of princes and nobles.
Finally one day, Ning Cheng got into trouble that even he couldn't bear. He actually offended Jian Sujie, the jewel in the palm of the Jian family in the Cangqin Kingdom. Not to mention that the Jian family was something that the Ning family couldn't afford, even Jian Sujie's fiancé, Qiu Yingguang, the Ning family couldn't afford to offend.
Thinking of this, Ning Cheng sighed. The result he couldn't afford to offend was, of course, that he was thrown into prison. Grandpa Ning Hongchang exhausted his connections and family wealth in order to get him out. As a result, he was not released, but instead took the entire Ning family into it. This news was learned from the jailer by his predecessor. It can be said that the Ning family was wiped out because of him.
After Ning Cheng sorted out these things, he sighed again in his heart. There is no reason in this world. Whoever has the biggest fist is the reason.
At the same time, he also understood who the person behind his back was. This disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luofei, somewhat similar to a child bride on earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably fell down, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luofei. But Ning Cheng's grandfather Ning Hongchang still took Ji Luofei to the Ning family, and planned to help the two get married after Ning Cheng gathered his energy.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other matters, but he would never give in on the matter of marrying Concubine Ji Luo. The original Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luo Fei. He often beat and scolded her. Fortunately, Ji Luofei accepted it and never refuted anything to Ning Cheng. And Ji Luofei is different from Ning Cheng. She has aptitude and can practice.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Cangqin Two-Star Academy and is already a monk at the third level of energy gathering. In Cangqin Kingdom, anyone who can cultivate is called a monk.
At this time, Ji Luofei had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the Black Stone House is low, its area is not too small, at least it has everything it should have. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well.
Even if it concerns himself, Ning Cheng has to make this matter clear. Although he guessed that it was the Jian family and the Qiu family who did it, he had to ask some questions.
"What you did yourself, why ask me?" Ji Luofei answered simply, and let Ning Cheng down.
After finishing speaking, she poured another glass of water to feed Ning Cheng, and then said: "I'll boil water for you to take a bath, just forget about some things, you know it's not good for you."
Ning Cheng watched Ji Luofei go in to boil water, and did not continue to ask, he understood what Ji Luofei meant. With his ability, the more he knows, the faster he will die.
I don't know if Ji Luofei added something to that glass of water, but Ning Cheng felt that after drinking this glass of water, his whole body regained some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden couch, thinking of his current situation for a while, and thinking of his younger sister Ning Ruolan for a while. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muwan treated him like that. According to what he knew about Tian Muwan, Tian Muwan was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li sailed on the lake in a boat, and the lake breeze was blowing on his face, refreshing and refreshing.
Yi Guogong's mansion is a huge lake of ten thousand hectares with ninety-nine islands. The Yanwu Hall he is going to is eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the boat, he was of medium build, wearing a fluttering blue shirt, with an ordinary appearance but quite heroic, looking at the vast lake, his thoughts drifted away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days!
A dignified high-energy physics researcher, a bright future student, a future great scientist, a small mistake in the experiment, came to this world after the explosion, reincarnated and reborn as a human being!
"Bang!" The muffled sound broke his contemplation, and he turned his head to see a golden carp jumping non-stop on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head, bent down and threw the carp back into the lake. Straightening up, a tall building came into his sight.
The 100-meter-tall building, shining with bronze light, is thick and fortified, showing the majesty of the Duke's Mansion.
This tall bronze building is Yanwu Hall!
In front of the Martial Arts Hall is an open martial arts field covered with red mud. Hundreds of people are practicing kung fu, or practicing knives, swords, fists, palms, or competing with each other. It is very lively.
Chu Li went ashore by boat and set foot on the martial arts field. After walking a few steps, a handsome young man suddenly appeared, with a face like a crown jade, eyebrows like swords, and a high spirit.
He is tall and tall, with Gao Chuli leaning on his head, hugging his shoulders and looking down at him: "My surname is Chu, what are you doing here?!"
Chu Li frowned: "Get out of the way, good dogs don't get in the way!"
The handsome young man laughed and said, "Could it be that you want to practice martial arts?"
Chu Li suddenly smiled, and continued to walk forward: "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed, believe it or not, you will be hungry and walk around?"
Fuwei prohibits private fighting, and forbids killing each other. Fuwei is divided into guards and bodyguards, one martial artist and one literary. Private fighting is especially strictly prohibited between the two.
Chu Li is an unqualified bodyguard, Zhuo Feiyang is an eighth-level bodyguard, it is a taboo for a bodyguard to attack a bodyguard, he fell to the ground and screamed, no matter how talented Zhuo Feiyang was, he would be severely punished.
Zhuo Feiyang frowned: "The surname is Chu, yes, shameless enough!" Chu Li continued to walk forward.
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside, with a gloomy handsome face: "Chu, you can only use these small tricks!"
Chu Li smiled and said, "To deal with a fool like you, small tricks are enough!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, clenched his fists tighter and tighter, as if he would throw them out in the next moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a bright smile, and raised his hand vigorously: "Junior Sister Zhao!"
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl came, her skin was like snow, her almond eyes and willow eyebrows, her temperament was delicate and gentle as water.
Chu Li's complexion changed slightly. Zhao Ying entered the mansion with them at the same time. She was beautiful, kind, and gentle. She was the kind of woman that men would like when they saw each other.
"Senior Brother Zhuo?" Zhao Ying walked over lightly, and said in surprise, "Senior Brother Chu?"
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought, and smiled: "Junior Sister Zhao, long time no see."
Since he was assigned to East Garden, he spent most of his time in the library, wanting to use knowledge to change his destiny, and rarely came to Yanwu Hall.
This time I came to Yanwu Temple because I encountered problems in practicing Xiaoximaijue, and I wanted to read the secrets and practice notes related to Xiaoximaijue.
Zhao Ying said with a smile: "Brother Chu, congratulations, East Garden is a good job."
Chu Li smiled and nodded: "It's not bad."
The East Garden directly belongs to the third lady Xiao Qi's Yuqi Island. Only he and Li Yue are the guards, not only leisurely, but also have the opportunity to meet the third lady.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy was so lucky that he got into the East Garden, God was so hard-nosed, I had to take care of him!
"Junior Sister Zhao, don't bother with this trash, I just practiced the Poluan swordsmanship yesterday, how about a spar?"
Zhao Ying frowned, feeling that Zhuo Feiyang's words were unpleasant.
"Okay, let's not say he is a trash!" Zhuo Feiyang quickly apologized, and glanced at Chu Li: "Although he is a trash!"
Zhao Ying's eyes widened in dissatisfaction.
"Junior Sister Zhao, it's okay," Chu Li said with a smile, "There's no need to care about such an arrogant idiot."
"Senior Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying said angrily.
Chu Li stretched out his hand to make a gesture of surrender: "Junior Sister Zhao, come to the East Garden to play. The scenery is beautiful, and Brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent."
"Hmph, what's there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang curled his lips: "It's just flowers and grass. If you have that time, it's better to practice martial arts and lose your mind!" "According to what you said, the third lady and the eldest son are both losers, why not you?" Chu Li seemed to be smiling, but the West Garden belonged to the eldest son Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang Jun blushed, sneered again and again, and decided not to quarrel with him.
"Senior Brother Zhuo! Senior Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying said dissatisfiedly, "Come on for a while, please!...Senior Brother Chu, I will go over to play. If you have something to do, do it first."
Chu Li took a deep look at her: "Junior Sister Zhao, someone has a good skin for nothing, and it takes a long time to see people's hearts. Junior Sister, don't trust others easily!"
"Chu, what do you mean!"
Chu Li ignored him, and hugged Zhao Ying with a smile.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang hurriedly wanted to follow, and before leaving, he suddenly stretched out his hand while Zhao Ying was not paying attention.
He was about to slap Chu Li's face with his slap, and he was very confident that Chu Li would not be able to dodge it in time. He didn't seem to pay attention, but he used his internal strength and was extremely fast.
Chu Li turned his head slightly, and Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips brushed against his cheeks, and he could feel the breeze, the force of this palm was not light.
"Snapped!"
There was a crisp and loud slap.
Chu Li slapped his face with his left palm, crisp and loud, with little force, the sound was very loud, and then he quickly stopped.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned her head to look. Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if the palm hadn't hit him on the face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him sullenly. Chu Li smiled and touched his face: "It's really good work, I admire it!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him.
"Senior Brother Zhuo——!" Zhao Ying's face darkened.
"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it." Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, squeezed out his voice, and said coldly: "I think Junior Brother Chu won't care, right, Junior Brother Chu?"
Chu Li turned his head and smiled, and said, "Junior Sister Zhao, forget it."
Zhao Ying looked at him in embarrassment, and hurriedly dragged Zhuo Feiyang away, if they stayed any longer, the two of them would have to fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back without moving, touched the hot left cheek, and activated Dayuan Jingzhi to suppress the fluctuations in his mood.
If it wasn't for Dayuan Jingzhi, Zhuo Feiyang would inevitably be plotted against him!
This world regards martial arts as the most important thing, and Zhao Ying was deeply rooted in his heart since he was a child. Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, and protects herself openly and secretly, which makes him quite moved.
But as a man, he needs a woman's protection. As a man, he really can't bear it!
He passed through the crowd on the martial arts training ground and entered the martial arts hall.
He untied the wooden sign around his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the hall. The young man glanced at him like lightning, indicating that he could go in.
There are rows of bookshelves in sight. He walked casually, stopped by chance, reached out and took out a book, flipped through it quickly, put it back and continued walking, stopped again, and took out a book to flip through it again.
In an hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
It seems that he already knew the location of these books, so he just went to take them out. In fact, it was his first time here, and he read Xiaoximaijue in the library.
The entire Yanwu Palace was presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, every book's name, clearly and vividly.
He strolled to the second floor, went directly to the third row of bookshelves, took out the Powang Sword Manual on the second floor, flipped through it, and then took out seven secret books, which were the cultivation experience of the Poxu Sword Manual.
When he left Yanwu Hall, thirty secret books, twenty-two small Ximai Jue practice notes, one book of the sword of breaking the illusion, and seven books of practice experience of the sword of breaking the illusion were imprinted in his mind.
He was driving a boat on the lake, the breeze was blowing, and the original raging anger had dissipated.
Thirty secret books in my mind began to integrate.
The noon sun was shining, and he sailed back to East Garden.
The East Garden is a small island with a radius of two miles. It is divided into flower gardens, each garden has a rare flower, and the whole island is full of flower fragrance.
There was only one small courtyard on the island. Chu Li opened the door and entered the courtyard, and a cool breath came over his face. A big tree covered half of the courtyard to drive away the heat.
He entered the west wing, brought out a Qingfeng sword, and swung it in the center of the courtyard, slowly like a Tai Chi sword. After a while, a layer of sweat broke out, and his forehead shone brightly.
He has a photographic memory, and the secret manuals he has read are imprinted in his mind once. The Pohuang swordsmanship he just learned from Yanwu Hall is indeed amazingly powerful, but it also consumes a lot of energy.
"Squeak..." A burly young man walked out of the main hall, with a big round face and small eyes.
He wobbled like a black bear, stretched his waist, yawned twice, and then said lazily: "Brother, are you back so early?"
Chu Li focused on practicing his sword and only hummed. Li Yue, the ninth-rank guard, and the two are in charge of the East Garden together. They have a good appetite, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts, but they are afraid of death and will not break into the ninth-rank building, so they are willing to be guards.
The guards and guards of the Duke's Mansion are divided into nine grades, and the salary difference is ten times.
The guards are paid less, and their ranks require seniority, nine ranks in three years, eight ranks in ten years, seven ranks in twenty years, six ranks in forty years, and five ranks in seventy years. The guard's promotion doesn't care about other things, he only looks at martial arts, break through the ninth-rank building, and pass through the first floor to advance to the first rank.
The salary is high, and you can often go out of the house to do tasks, and live a colorful life. Unlike guards who can only stay in the house to serve people, anyone with a little ability can be a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched his legs, his joints made a series of crackling noises, and then began to practice with his fists, which were like shooting stars, whistling like wind.
"Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li spat out two words, his forehead was covered with soybean sweat.
Martial arts are flourishing in this world, and martial arts training begins with babies.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are finalized, no matter how magical the mental method is, it will take twice the result with half the effort, and it will take several times the time to build the foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he went to the Akiba Temple where he grew up to learn the source scriptures of great wisdom and missed foundation building. The essence is twice that of ordinary people, and the spirit is tyrannical.
In addition, he was a high-energy physics researcher in his previous life, so his understanding of the world is far beyond comparison.
With the combination of the two, he finally practiced the source sutra of great wisdom and achieved the supernatural power of great circle mirror wisdom.
His spirit is strong, his practice duration is far longer than that of ordinary people, his supernatural powers are in his body, and he can see the subtleties, so his little pulse washing formula is progressing very quickly, and he can build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe..., with your sword, you can't kill a chicken, so what are you doing?"
Chu Li suddenly withdrew his sword and snorted, "Bibi?"
He was out of breath, and his whole body was limp. He pushed the sword to the ground to support his body. The breaking swordsmanship was too exhausting.
1. Chapter 1
In the quaint room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of an excellent special soldier!
As soon as the hand fell, there was a sore pain like an electric shock, and a burst of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
A gentle female voice came from beside my ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face, looking at him with concern.
This is a classic beauty, so beautiful that people are breathless, and she can be described as a country and a city.
Ling Tian, a native of China.
He once served in the most outstanding Spike Special Operations Force in China, and made countless contributions during his service.
He participated in the world-class special forces competition, won the personal honor of being the first in individual combat ability, and was recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, in a cross-border SSS-level mission, because of his small personal negligence, a comrade-in-arms sacrificed.
Under self-blame, he chose to retire and left Spike.
After retiring, he was quiet for a while, and chose to go abroad, becoming the trump card of a certain mercenary organization with the most prestigious international reputation.
As long as it is a task that he takes action, the success rate is 100% unprecedented!
Although he has retired from Langya for many years, he still cares about Huaguo.
As long as it is a task that is not good for the country of China, not only will he not accept it, but he will also find out the person who issued the task and carry out brutal and inhumane killings.
Over time, he became a thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh of all countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a ticking time bomb.
However, as each killer evaporated from the world, Ling Tian lived more and more happily, and no killer dared to accept this 'death mission' anymore.
Killing Ling Tian is tantamount to seeking his own death. This is a well-known saying in the world of mercenaries and killers.
Throughout the earth, it is rare to meet an opponent, and it has never been defeated!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
Country R manufactured a colorless and odorless biochemical weapon, and planned to transport it into China to carry out a tragic conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian would not sit idly by.
He made a move!
With the help of the broker, the location of the batch of biological weapons was found.
Just when he fought his way out, entered the underground research room, and was about to destroy the batch of biochemical weapons. The underground research room was suddenly dented, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When I saw people from country R holding various firearms, they appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian understood.
I was betrayed by the person I trusted the most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the conspiracy of the R country people would not succeed.
Until he was shot to death by random gunfire, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"Tian'er, what's the matter with you, don't scare mother."
A gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he did not know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at her close relatives, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
Just when Ling Tian was about to argue with this beauty.
Ling Tian was completely stunned as if struck by lightning, as if he had been hit by acupuncture points.
The only thing that satisfies Ling Tian is that this guy is also called Ling Tian, and his full name is 'Duan Ling Tian'.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old.
A child with a foreign surname from the Li family in Qingfeng Town.
His mother, 'Li Rou', is the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father... In his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of fusing this strange memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Ling Tian was seriously injured and lying on the bed.
Early this morning, 'Li Xin', the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family, scolded Duan Lingtian for being a bastard born with a mother but not taught by a father.
However, how could he, who hadn't even finished tempering his body, be the opponent of Li Xin, who was in the second level of body tempering state, and was directly seriously injured by Li Xin, dying.
After merging all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian is him.
"Ma'am, the Patriarch sent someone to bring the medicine."
Duan Lingtian raised his head as a sound came from his ear.
A servant girl hurried in from the room and handed the exquisite box in her hand to Li Rou.
The box is opened. Immediately, the fragrance of the medicine wafted away.
"Tian'er, come, take the elixir, and mother will heal your wounds."
Li Rou took out a dark pill from it, and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The pill melted in his mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A gust of cold air flowed into his body, dissipating the warm current transformed from the pill, and healing him.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that most of the soreness on his body disappeared, without any burden.
What he took just now was a panacea?
At this time, Duan Lingtian noticed that Li Rou's face was pale, and his forehead was still sweating, obviously spending a lot of energy to heal his injuries.
"Mother, are you okay?"
Duan Lingtian felt warm in his heart.
This 'mother' was a friendly cry without any unnaturalness.
"It's okay, mother, just take a rest."
Li Rou shook her head with a smile.
For the sake of his son, it is nothing to spend this bit of energy.
"He and the Seventh Elder are still waiting in the Criminal Court." Half an hour later, the servant girl walked into the room again and said softly.
"Let go? Go tell the person sent by the owner, I will deal with this matter myself."
The kindness and amiability on Li Rou's face disappeared, leaving a cold face.
"Mother, what kind of elixir did you give me just now, I feel that my injury is almost healed."
Duan Lingtian got off the bed and stretched his body slightly.
"That's the 'Eight-Rank Jinchuang Pill'."
It turned out that even the Li family in Qingfeng Town only had two of these eighth-rank Jinchuang Pills, but now they actually used one on a child with a foreign surname.
Obviously, his mother's status in the Li family is not low.
"Tian'er, the Patriarch is still waiting, let's go there."
Li Rou brought Duan Lingtian to a spacious courtyard in the Li family mansion.
This is where the Li family enforces the family law. Criminal Court!
It was noon, and the sun was scorching in the sky.
The execution courtyard was full of people, all of them were children of the Li family who were watching the excitement.
In the courtyard, a young man was tied to a Xingzhu and exposed to the sun, with two middle-aged men standing beside him.
The cross-eyed middle-aged man on the right looked angry when he saw Duan Lingtian, mother and son.
"Duan Lingtian is also here... The eighth-grade Jinchuang Pill treasured by the family is really powerful!" "Yes, I saw Duan Lingtian when he was carried back. He was half dead."
"It's the same for Li Xin. It's fine to bully Duan Lingtian casually. The Ninth Elder wouldn't say anything, but this time he hit such a heavy hand and almost killed Duan Lingtian. It's no wonder the Ninth Elder didn't get mad."
Seeing Li Rou and Duan Lingtian coming, all the Li family children whispered to each other.
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
"Elder Ninth, my son Li Xin was at fault for what happened today, but now that your son is fine and mine has been exposed to the sun all morning, can you let him go?"
At this moment, the cross-eyed middle-aged man, that is, Li Kun, the seventh elder of the Li family, has a gloomy expression on his face.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't pay attention to him at all.
Instead, he brought Duan Lingtian to Li Xin who was tied up.
"My God, how did he hurt you this morning? Now, you will pay him back everything!" Chapter 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, she found a very serious problem. The surrounding environment has changed so that she doesn't recognize it at all!
Looking out through the gap in the corridor, there is a moon hanging in the air, and the stars are shining all over the sky, and she is lying on her back and being carried forward.
She was a little dazed, couldn't help moving, and then discovered a more serious problem—she was naked! She was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which tightly wrapped her from head to toe, with only a pair of eyes exposed.
Her cold gaze first fell on the two big men who were carrying her.
Kong Wu is powerful, his muscles are knotted, and he is dressed as a warrior in ancient costume. Although he is carrying people and walks quietly, he looks like a practicing family son, and his martial arts are not low.
Gu Xijiu's fingers in the quilt tightened!
She is the king of modern killers, ruthless and ruthless, and she roams the world, but she did not expect to encounter the assassination of the person she trusts the most. That person is named Long Xi, who is her former instructor and doctor. She doesn't trust anyone, only she believes He, even likes him, wants to marry him.
She was already dead, but she didn't expect to go to Yan Wang Ye for tea, but she came here out of nowhere.
At this time, she naturally wouldn't think that she had arrived at some shooting base.
She crossed over!
After transmigrating into this body, it was wrapped like a rice dumpling and carried to a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah... ah... help... help... ah, ah, don't..." The woman's tender and painful scream came out instantly, and Gu Xijiu's thoughts were revived. She glanced quickly and froze slightly! The furnishings in the main hall are naturally beautiful, whether it is the rosewood tables and chairs, or the flower and bird tortoise shell screen, all of them show two words - noble!
The man above is handsome and twenty-seven or eight years old. His long hair is tied with a green jade hairpin, and it is scattered on his shoulders. His muscles are smooth and his movements are strong and powerful. The corners of his lips are slightly pursed. With a cold smile on his face, he is considered a cool and handsome macho.
The one below is an immature girl, who looks very young, with delicate features, and is different from the man's expression of enjoyment. The little girl's face is pale, her mouth is slightly opened, her voice is already hoarse, she is sobbing, and the cold sweat has wiped her out. Her hair was drenched and she was clearly in extreme pain. Gu Xijiu's expression changed slightly!
This bastard, strong x seedling! Who is he?
Those two big men carried Gu Xijiu in, but they didn't disturb the man's good spirits. His movements were faster and fiercer!
The little girl finally couldn't bear it anymore, she yelled hoarsely a few times, rolled her eyes, tilted her head, and didn't move.
"Disappointing!" The man cursed in a low voice, rolled over, got off the girl, and kicked the girl off the bed like trash.
The girl didn't move, her small face had turned sallow, and blood was streaming from the corners of her lips. I don't know whether it is dead or alive.
"This is too useless, take it to the mass grave to feed the dogs!" The man's tone was full of desire and dissatisfaction.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona and the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. It is adjacent to Las Vegas to the west and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and Las Vegas. Many Chinese have heard of these four names, but not many people know about Flagstaff City, which is surrounded by these four regions.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of the "not many", until he came to Qigan City to study abroad.
Flagstaff is not well-known in China, nor is it well-known in the United States, but it does have several good universities, such as the University of Arizona and Flagstaff American College.
The school where Li Du studied abroad is called Flagstaff National College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but there is a huge difference between these words!
Flagstaff American Academy is a branch of the American Academy. It is a very good private university that provides undergraduate, junior college, and preparatory education.
This is a pheasant university, and Li Du was completely tricked into coming to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds had only been paid in the first half of the year, and the school was closed down. People from the school board and the admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving behind a group of international students who were forced to leave the school by the police.
Li Du was lucky, because the school dormitory was too messy, he didn't live in a dormitory in order to study quietly, but found an apartment room for rent, now at least he has a place to stay. Those of his classmates who paid the boarding fee to live in the school are now wandering on the streets.
But his situation is not much better than that of his classmates. Now it is the end of January, and his rent is due. If he does not pay the rent in time, he may have to live on the street.
Unfortunately, he has no money at this time!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and domestic classmates and friends, but there is a prerequisite for that, that is, he is studying abroad. Now that the school is banned, he will definitely not be able to study as a graduate student. How can he have the face to ask his elderly parents for money? As for finding classmates and friends?
Sitting at the door of the small building with a sad face, the pine door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde girl poked her head out: "Hi, Li, are you here?"
This girl is his landlord, named Hannah Fox. The house is the legacy of her parents who died in a car accident, and belongs to her and her brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed that he was "busy with big business" and would not come to live for a few days throughout the year, and the vacant bedroom was rented out by Hannah to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du got up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's the matter?"
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear dimple appeared on her beautiful face: "I saw a few cans of beer when I was cleaning the refrigerator just now, it must have been left by that guy Hans. I remember you like wort beer, why don't you drink it?"
She held half a dozen of six bottles of beer in her hand, packed in a very common wooden box with a very obvious Budweiser LOGO on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There is only one small refrigerator in the apartment, and he opens and closes it every day. How can there be any beer in it?
Besides, with Hans' temper, if there was beer, he would definitely not stay. This guy is addicted to alcohol.
Based on his guess, Hannah bought the beer to comfort him. After learning that their school was closed down, Hannah had comforted him many times, which moved him very much.
However, Hannah didn't have many ways to comfort him, either giving him an inspirational book or giving him beer.
This American girl asked him to learn more about Chinese culture, and learned the saying that 'drunkness can relieve a thousand worries'. She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping would relieve worries, so she gave him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness, and he owed the girl a favor. In American society, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise they will be misunderstood and rejected friendship. He cherishes the friendship with Hannah very much.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile. Before leaving, she said: "There are many problems in life, but it is still beautiful."
After chanting this American slang phrase several times, Li Du opened the package to take out a can of beer. But just as he opened the wooden box, an amber-like crystal suddenly fell out, and fell to the ground with a 'click'.
The crystal was about the size of his thumb, and it fell heavily on the concrete floor, with several cracks appearing on it.
The reason why he guessed it was amber was because it was light yellow in color and contained a small worm inside, which was very similar to an amber he had seen when he was in sixth grade. At that time, their textbook had a text called "Amber". When the Chinese teacher taught them, he brought an amber.
The crystal brought back some good memories from his childhood, when his teacher said that amber with worms was precious. It's a pity that this one has been cracked, which makes him very regretful, otherwise he might be able to exchange for two months' living expenses if he sells it.
The crystal fell badly, and it shattered when he picked it up, exposing the purple worm wrapped in it.
The shape of the small insect is similar to that of a locust. It is about two centimeters long. It has strange shape and compound eyes like a locust. However, it has only two legs under its stomach. There are strange lines on the legs and no wings on its back. It looks very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug before, so he raised it up strangely to see it clearly.
At this moment, a strange thing happened: Xiao Chong's claws suddenly moved, and then quickly regained its vitality, twisting its body to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the little bug jumped behind his palm, its head drooping down, and slowly, bit by bit, it got into his palm!
Li Du was scared to pee, he really wanted to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled into the house and shouted, "Hannah, call 911! Help, a bug has gotten into my hand!"
It is estimated that his screams were too harsh, and Hannah panicked when she came out: "What? What bug?"
Li Du spread out his hand for her to see: "This is it, this worm in my palm!"
Hannah was at a loss: "The worm in your palm? How can there be a worm in your palm?"
Not only was there a bug, but the bug was still moving. After it got into Li Du's palm, it seemed unwilling to be lonely. Now it got out again, and half of its body got out.
Li Du pointed at the bug that was burrowing out, and said in horror: "This, that's it, purple locust, can't you see it?"
Li Du interrupted her and shouted: "I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah!"
"Xue Te, this bug has come out again!"
Just as he was screaming hoarsely, Xiao Chong slowly got out of his skin and jumped to the ground, raised his upper body to support his legs, and walked on the ground like a human being.
Coincidentally, there was a drain next to where it landed, and the bug walked past it without paying attention, and fell headfirst.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, "Great, the bug fell into the drain."
Subconsciously, an idea appeared in his mind, that is, what is in the drain? Will there be sewage and drown the bug?
However, a scene that made him unbelievable happened!
Chapter One
The land of China, the northern desert.
Ice and snow raged across the entire land, and the vast mountains and ravines were all covered in silver, and the goose-feather snow fell, making the sky and the earth look like one color from a distance.
On the curved mountain road, a caravan was resting. The wind and snow were too heavy, and it was difficult for the carriage to move. They had to wait for the wind and snow to calm down before going on the road.
"Look, coffin puller!"
The exclamation of a middle-aged man caught the attention of everyone in the caravan. A group of people curiously raised their heads and looked into the distance. After only a few glances, they were all shocked physically and mentally!
The wind and snow were howling all over the sky, and the world became misty. A mysterious ancient golden coffin loomed in the distant mountain road, gradually appearing in everyone's sight.
The ancient golden coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the walls of the coffin were engraved with simple patterns and runes. The patterned runes exude a faint light, which isolates all the falling snowflakes, which is extremely weird.
What shocked everyone was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a boy who looked only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was naked to the waist, arched his back, grasped two huge cold iron chains with both hands, carried the iron chains on his shoulders, and was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
In a world of ice and snow, the boy pulls the coffin!
This picture is very visually impactful and breathtaking. The gloomy light emitted from the ancient golden coffin at the back reflected the young man's body a bit blurry, and his face could not be seen clearly. In a daze, everyone seemed to see a god pulling the coffin.
"This boy is born with supernatural power."
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people recovered their senses and looked at the young man carefully, making sure that he didn't have any light of profound energy shining on him, and they were moved again.
Ordinary willow coffins weigh three to four hundred catties, but this ancient coffin is cast in gold, needless to say at least three thousand catties.
If a teenager doesn't have profound strength, then he is not a real warrior. Even a strong man has only five or six hundred catties of strength. The young man can pull the ancient coffin of three thousand catties by himself. Although it seems a bit strenuous, it is shocking enough.
"You are young, and you are quite handsome. To actually come to pull the coffin, does this young man want to be unlucky for the rest of his life?"
An old man became emotional, and many people nodded in agreement. Although pulling coffins is not common, it happened occasionally in Beimo's history, and everyone knows a little bit about it.
When important elders of the Beimo family died, they liked to bury them in huge golden coffins. These giant coffins will not be buried under the ground, but placed on the top of the iceberg, so it is said that they can protect the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters major changes, the family will hold a coffin-drawing ceremony to find a new iceberg to transfer the family's ancestral coffins, replace the feng shui, and recast the family's well-being.
This is how the coffin puller appeared.
Pulling the coffin is something that damages luck. In the minds of many Beimo people, when pulling the coffin, their luck will be absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body's essence and lifespan will also be absorbed, which will lead to bad luck or illness for a lifetime.
Therefore, pulling coffins is the most humble occupation in Beimo. No matter how high the commission is, young warriors will not be tempted. Only downcast old warriors will pull coffins.
The young man has beautiful features, is about 1.75 meters tall, has broad shoulders and narrow waist, slender legs, and knotted muscles. Wearing a simple animal tooth around the neck, it looks very wild, and it is very good in terms of appearance.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome in appearance, with terrifying supernatural powers, the conditions of a teenager are not bad. But come to do this most humble and insidious coffin-drawing job?
"He is not afraid of being robbed of his luck, his lifespan will be greatly reduced, and he will be unlucky for the rest of his life?" The middle-aged man glanced at the ancient golden coffin, and said in relief: "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family? That's right, I heard that the Liu family There have been major changes recently, and sky-high prices have been offered. "
"Shut up, people from the Liu family are here." An old man said suddenly, and everyone in the caravan immediately shut up and looked into the distance.
Woohoo!
Howling wild beasts came from afar, and a group of warriors wearing black battle armor and riding silver giant wolves galloped towards them, before they got close to the fierce aura of the giant wolf.
"The Silver Wolf Guards are indeed warriors from the Liu family."
Everyone nodded secretly. In the entire area around Wuling City, there was only one army riding a silver wolf. It was the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guards stopped after catching up with the young man. A middle-aged giant in the front held a long whip, looked at the young man and shouted coldly, "Lu Li, hurry up! If you don't reach the Black Eagle Ridge before dark, you will have nothing to lose." any reward."
The boy named Lu Li looked up and was surrounded by more than a dozen huge silver wolves one meter high and two meters long. He nodded without much fear and said, "Don't worry, my lord, I will definitely arrive before dark."
The giant man let out a deep cry, galloped away with the silver wolf guards, and quickly disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan staying nearby, and continued to move forward silently. He grasped the giant cold iron chain with both hands, carried it on his shoulders and strenuously moved forward. Every step he took was extremely difficult, and the muscles all over his body trembled. Even so, he didn't stop in his footsteps, and he quickly crossed the caravan and walked into the distance.
"It's so heavy!"
After traveling for a few miles, Lu Li stopped after going up a steep slope. He was so tired that he was out of breath, but he was sweating profusely in such a severe cold weather. One can imagine his physical exertion.
He thought about resting for a while, and after placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a stone and took out water and dried meat from the sack behind his back, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
Should be there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat, he looked at the sky, his eyes brightened quickly, and he said to himself: "You can exchange a pill by pulling a coffin. Can one increase the force by five hundred catties?"
"If I can really increase my strength by five hundred catties, I now have three thousand catties of strength. I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand catties of strength, and I can... awaken my blood!"
"Who dares to bully my sister in the tribe? Hehe, I will be able to lead my sister to live a good life soon."
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face glowed with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his steps were more steady and faster.
rustle!
After walking for a few miles, a voice sounded from behind. Lu Li looked back, his face slightly sad.
There is also a puller in the back, but it is an old man. The old man's hands holding the iron chain were shining with streaks of white light, and there were faint white lights flowing on his feet.
Lu Li murmured enviously, the white light is the profound strength only a warrior has. The strength of a warrior with profound strength will increase a lot. This old man used his profound strength, so he walked like flying and easily pulled the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lu Li. He took a look, frowned and said, "Young man, why are you dragging the coffin? This will damage your luck."
Lu Li smiled and didn't say anything. The old man glanced at him a few times, and quickly pulled the coffin away without saying anything.
"If you can't awaken your blood, what future is there? You can only be mediocre all your life, being bullied every day, and your sister suffers along with it."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became a little distorted. He roared, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The wind and snow are getting bigger and bigger, and the sky is gradually getting darker. The gloomy light emanating from the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain road is faintly visible, which looks very strange and mysterious.
Chapter 001
"My brother is going to find a job. You should do your homework at home. Here is ten yuan. Don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon."
In front of a low house in the slums, Lu Li patted the little girl's head, lovingly rubbing it again and again. It's great to see her younger sister alive and healthy!
"Brother, I know," Little Loli complained with her mouth pouted, "Don't rub my hair, it's all messed up by you."
Younger sister Lu Xin thoughtfully helped Lu Li tidy up his clothes, and told him like a grown-up, "You must work hard. Brother is so hardworking. I believe he will be able to find a job this time."
"Don't worry, my brother will definitely find a good job and earn a lot of money, so that Xinxin can live a good life," Lu Li hugged his sister, and added inwardly, he won't just watch you lose a little bit because of lack of money. life.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will make a lot of money," the little loli writhed in Lu Li's arms, waving her fists confidently.
No matter how reluctant he was, Lu Li bid farewell to his sister.
When he got on the bus, he paused with his hands in his pockets, and couldn't help smiling wryly.
The money I gave my sister for lunch just now returned to my pocket. I should have expected that this little girl would do this. It's so cute and heartbreaking.
Now is the 23rd century, science and technology are infinitely advanced, and various smart technologies are flooding every corner of the world. This development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but incidentally, it also minimizes the demand for manpower.
Unemployment is no longer a rare thing, especially for people at the bottom of society like Lu Li, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there is no accident, he will always be unemployed.
It wasn't until he joined a game guild's gold mining group by chance that he became stable. However, when he entered this game called "Dawn", the game had been open for nearly a year, and his level was too far behind. Therefore, he has not been able to join the super game. The list of masters.
Two years later, younger sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during the school physical examination.
He has no money to pay millions of dollars in medical expenses, and has been hunted down by several trade unions during the game. He can only watch his only relative weaken day by day in pain.
That feeling was worse than cutting flesh with a knife. Lu Li hugged his sister more than once and cried bitterly.
However, fate took a twist. On the day he received the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and fell asleep beside his sister's hospital bed. When he woke up, he found that he had been reborn three years ago.
While happy that his sister is still healthy, he knows that he must make money, a lot of money.
Only with money can my sister's illness be cured as soon as possible, and only with money can my sister live the happy life that an innocent and cute little girl should live like those countless people of her age.
Only when you have money will you be proud, and you will never be inferior to others!
Counting and calculating, Lu Li found helplessly that even if he was reborn, it would not be easy for him to become rich.
All he could do seemed to be to play the game—the "Dawn" he had been playing for more than two years—there were only a few days left before the game was released.
Lu Li had already given up on looking for a serious job. He came out today and went directly to the headquarters of the Xingyue Union where he had served in his previous life.
The Xingyue union is not the top ten games, nor is it the top four in China. It is just a game alliance formed by a group of college students. .
Located next to the University Town, Qinghu Community is considered the most beautiful place in this generation. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, cherry blossoms are everywhere, with office buildings in front and villas in the back. Only very wealthy people can set up companies here.
The beauty at the front desk took a disgusted look at Lu Li's clothes, dialed a series of numbers, and informed Lu Li that he could go in for an interview.
"At present, we only recruit death squads, and we don't accept goldsmiths," said a girl who was in charge of the recruitment. She was dressed in a trendy dress and was in charge of the interview without raising her head while she was applying nail polish.
The so-called death squads are actually cannon fodder, and it is normal to die more than a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Li wanted to find a studio to join was to use the studio's game helmets for free. Although goldsmiths have no future, they can at least be upgraded. Cannon fodder that is destined to be difficult to upgrade is not what he wants. experienced.
"What, 20 gold!" The nail polish was all over her face, and the girl screamed like a trampled cat.
Although "Dawn" represents the most advanced virtual technology today and has the world's most first-class design team, it is not confident enough to dare to go public without using the inside. It's just that the content of the test is relatively small, and it is a decentralized test. It will not affect normal gameplay.
In just a few days of testing, the deepest impression left on players is that gold coins are not easy to play, and there are too many places to spend money.
Players of normal games basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold players can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that if they want to save enough 20 gold to establish a guild, it will take at least a week or more for a 100-member gold raiding group to farm suitable monsters, remove the consumption of equipment and potions, and this is the third time in the game. Before the system update, the money burst rate was high.
And this kid in front of him actually promised to give out 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you ever participated in the inside, did you find some money-spending bug?" the beauty recruiter asked suspiciously, her heart moved.
Lu Li smiled without saying a word, appearing extremely inscrutable.
"Ao Jian, I have something to do here. Come here... Well, someone came to apply for a gold worker and said that he could hand in 20 gold within a week. I suspect that he has a bug in collecting money." There is no way to recruit beautiful women, but Whispered to call the higher-ups.
Not long after, they heard a rush of footsteps, and when they turned their heads, Lu Li was also a little surprised.
Apart from Xingyue's boss, Ao Jian, the people who came here actually followed several people. Lu Li had been in the Xingyue union for two years in his previous life. Most of these people knew each other, and they were all high-ranking members of the union.
"Oh, don't tell me, this guy is the one who can get 20 gold a week," the little man walking beside Ao Jian couldn't help but wailed. Commander, he is a very frizzy person.
"You have a way to get twenty gold coins within a week, are you sure it's the game "Dawn"?" Ao Jian's face was not very good-looking, he was holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope gone too.
Lu Li's appearance was ordinary, his complexion was sallow and dark, his clothes were wrinkled, and there were obvious traces of frayed lines at the corners. One could tell that he was the kind of person who was at the bottom of society.
"It's nothing to say, even if you can't get you, it's not a big loss, is it?" Facing the huge aura surrounded by social elites, Lu Li didn't have the embarrassment of the low-level people, just smiled faintly, calmly There seemed to be endless confidence in his eyes.
Chapter One
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay, get up quickly, class is about to start, this class is ruthless, get up quickly." A somewhat anxious voice rang in Ye Mo's ear, Ye Mo had a A very strange feeling.
"This idiot, I think I've been shamed, so I covered my face." Another voice rang in his ears, but Ye Mo woke up now.
Ye Mo looked around in a daze, but he didn't recognize anyone, they were all unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's bewildered look, there was another burst of laughter. It was obvious that the laughter here was directed at him. Seeing that the laughing people around him seemed to be laughing at him, he didn't dare to ask for a while. , can only be on guard secretly to prevent someone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who didn't laugh at himself, because he kindly pushed himself to wake up just now.
"Why is it like a school?" Ye Mo subconsciously asked in surprise.
"Haha..." There was another burst of laughter.
"Ye Mo, I think you are confused. Can Yanyan write love letters? It's okay that you are in the Ye family. Now you are not a member of the Ye family. Be careful in the future."
The tablemate sighed, of course he didn't believe that Ye Mo wouldn't remember after such a while, he just wanted to save face. He hasn't recognized the reality yet, he is no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head was throbbing with pain. He remembered that he and his master Luo Ying were refining Huiyuan Pill, and then the group of miscellaneous hairs from Xiliumen came over, and then there were explosions and all kinds of fighting sounds. The master used a talisman to hold him, but why did he appear here? Is this still the Luoyue Continent?
By the way, I am sitting here now, where is Master? The master is only three years older than him, not to mention that the reason why Xiliumen came to attack them suddenly is because the master is too beautiful. The young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful master, but was rejected by the master matter.
If the master falls into Xiliumen's hands, the consequences will be disastrous. Thinking of this, Ye Mo couldn't bear the panic in his heart anymore, and stood up suddenly.
"What's the matter, don't you know the bell is ringing for class?" A cold-faced young woman walked up to the podium with a few books between her arms, and coldly glanced at the laughing students below, her laughter suddenly died down.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, the English lecturer, and what she hates the most is the booing of the students, and once she catches her eye, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already felt that something was wrong. Although he could understand these words, the obvious language was not his original language. Could it be that this is not Luoyue Continent? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly, a burst of headache came, and a lot of messy information was remembered.
And Ye Mo was completely kicked out of Ye Family after his father died, the specific reason was because Ye Mo was not Ye Wentian's seed. To be more precise, after the death of Ye Mo's father, Ye Mo's blood relationship was re-identified, and it was determined that he was not of the Ye family, so he was kicked out of Yemen.
But he also has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. It's just that he and he are not the same mother, but half brothers and sisters. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Mo, and he specifically proposed to the old man of the Ye family to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianwen probably knew that he was not in good health, so he wanted to find a backer for Ye Mo, and finally found it. The Ning family in Beijing.
Of course, the Ning family is extremely willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China. He promised Ning Qingxue, the granddaughter of Mr. Ning, to Ye Mo.
During a medical examination at the hospital, Ye Mo was found to be impotent, to put it bluntly, he was inhumane. Although the Ye family tried their best to hide the truth, it seemed that everyone in the capital knew overnight that Ye family, one of the five major families in China, suffered from impotence, and the Ye family lost a lot of face.
"Ah..." The memory was flipped here, Ye Mo screamed, stood up, and almost immediately took off his pants to take a look. He already understood that he might be reborn into a person named Ye Mo, but he was so inhumane, it would be better to kill him.
"That classmate, what's your name, what are you yelling during class, go to my office after class." The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's scream, and her face was very ugly.
The rest of the students in the class were secretly amused, sending a college student to the office every now and then, probably only this English teacher can do it, it's not good if you don't go, the credits are in their hands.
Ye Mo sat down dejectedly. Although he didn't know much about the inside story of the family struggle, he also understood that he was kicked out of the Ye family probably because of impotence, not necessarily because he was not a member of the Ye family. Besides, who knows if there are some tricks in the DNA test.
What Ye Mo is worried about is not about being kicked out of the Ye family, he doesn't care about this at all, what he cares about is about his impotence. Also, what happened to his master Luo Ying.
But he also understood why the classmates in the class laughed, it was because his predecessor had already been kicked out of the Ye family, but he still insisted on pursuing Yanyan, the hottest girl in the class. In the end, he posted his confession letter on the blackboard, then stood on the podium and looked at himself contemptuously and said, "Master Ye, can you sleep with me?"
Later, when the news of impotence was reported, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to save face, but what he didn't expect was that the girl who flattered him would treat him like this, so he fainted in embarrassment. Cheaper your own rebirth.
I was reborn in such a place. He couldn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's class on the podium. Even if he could, Ye Mo wouldn't listen to it. He absolutely couldn't accept the fact that he was impotent. Rather than being reborn like this, it is better not to be reborn.
It doesn't matter if you can't get into the university, the most important thing is to figure out your current situation. His impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family. Although he was kicked out of the Ye family, who knows if he will be killed suddenly? Perhaps there were other inside stories that caused him to be kicked out of the Ye family. Is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the bell rang, the first thing Ye Mo did was not to go to the beautiful teacher, but to rush out of the school in a hurry. He wanted to find a place to see if his penis was really impotent.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are many small alleys. Ye Mo hurried into a remote and deserted small alley, and quickly pulled down his pants.
The little girl is really small, but Ye Mo didn't feel disappointed because the little girl was small, but really let out a long sigh. He was not impotent, but because his penis was too big, it was blocked by a meridian, resulting in this false impotence.
But that's it, with the current technology on the earth, it is undoubtedly a dream to open up this blocked meridian, but this is not difficult for Ye Mo, although he still does not have the ability to open the blocked meridian, let his little ** Get stronger, but as long as he reaches the third level of Qi training, this meridian will be opened automatically.
It's just that Ye Mo immediately began to feel a little disappointed again, because in the situation where the vitality of the earth is so thin, it is undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of Qi training. Maybe he can't reach it in his whole life. In that case, he It is still equivalent to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants when he suddenly shuddered with an exclamation.
"Playing hooligans..." A soprano voice with a high decibel sounded right in front of Ye Mo. Ye Mo was only checking his penis just now, but forgot to check the surrounding situation. I didn't expect that this small alley is still connected, but I can't see it at the turning in front.
Ye Mo is not an exhibitionist, besides, he doesn't have much capital to expose now, so he quickly pulled up his pants and was about to slip away.
"Ye Mo, why is it you?" After the woman screamed, she asked in a surprised tone, obviously she knew Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the dead of night, Qingzhu Senior Community in Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents in his hand, looking at the swimming pool outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, full of disappointment and unwillingness.
As the leader of Youying, one of the four major game studios in Jinhai City, he leads a large guild with tens of thousands of people, and he is also a well-known master sword magician in Jinhai City, but now he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
Ten years of gaming career.
Ten years of bloody fighting.
After experiencing countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild, established ten city-states in "God's Domain", and could start to compete with first-class guilds and enjoy endless glory. Gone forever.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. For the sake of the game, he gave up so much, but in the end he became someone else's wedding dress. It was all because he opposed the shadow being merged into the super guild to dominate the world. The Tianlanhua Consortium gave him an answer, deleting the 200-level sword king account that he spent ten years of painstaking efforts to cultivate, and went to the financial office to settle the salary.
What he can get is five million credits and a mansion. Compared with the top ten city-states and the virtual kingdom that is making money every day, it is less than a drop in the bucket.
Shi Feng thought that he had paid so much for the shadow, turning the Lanhua Group into a big consortium. He was responsible for a lot of credit, but in the end he was thrown away like trash. Regarding what the Lanhua Consortium did, he will surely take revenge.
"I will never let it go like this. At worst, I will start all over again."
Confidence and firmness shone in Shi Feng's eyes. The contract termination document in his hand was torn to shreds. Then he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and took a few sips.
Even without the Sword King account and without the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, they can still rise in God's Domain and build a virtual kingdom of their own again.
In the morning, the sun has just risen.
Didi!
The phone's ringtone kept ringing.
Shi Feng was dissatisfied with being woken up, so he got up and picked up the phone beside the bed. He was still dizzy from last night's hangover.
"Hey, what's the matter?"
"Brother Feng, I'm Heizi, what are you asking? We agreed to become professional gamers, and today is the recruiting day for the shadow studio at school. Didn't you always want to be a core member of the shadow?"
Shi Feng was a little confused.
He was just fired by the Lanhua Consortium, so how could he go to the shadow assessment. "Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
are you listening They are going to test at ten o'clock, if you don't come here soon, it will be too late! "
"Heizi, stop joking, I was just fired by Shadow."
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? You haven't woken up until now. Youying hasn't recruited yet. Why were you fired? Come on quickly."
Before Shi Feng could react, Heizi hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, who was in a daze, looked at his mobile phone, and found that this dilapidated Ai Crazy Six was not his mobile phone at all, but his mobile phone was the latest Ai Crazy Twelve.
Then look around. The small bedroom of less than fifteen square meters is a mess, with books about game strategies everywhere, and a laptop on the desk in the corner, which is also a very outdated old model. In the large wardrobe by the wall, there are many clothes, and a familiar face appeared in the fitting mirror of the wardrobe.
Shi Feng was suddenly startled when he saw this familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the fitting mirror, and after taking photos again and again, he was sure that he had really become younger.
I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom yesterday, but now that I wake up, I am in this dilapidated place, and I feel younger.
For this place, Shi Feng still has some memories. That was ten years ago, he gritted his teeth and rented a small house for more than half a year in order to fight for God's Domain in his senior year. After earning some money in God's Domain, he rented a big apartment-style house in the city.
I think it was extremely difficult back then, and the family situation was not good. In order to let him go to college, he owed a lot of foreign debts, so his parents worked hard every month to send enough living expenses to make himself suffer.
Shi Feng only wanted to make money to change his family, but there are college students all over the street, and finding a job with a good income is difficult, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game. In order to improve his game skills, he bought a virtual game. Helmets have become the target of professional players, practicing hard skills in virtual games.
At that time, he ate white flour steamed buns and instant noodles every day. In order to save money, he never participated in every reunion or fellowship organized by the class, so he became a little transparent in the class, despised by the boys, and kept away by the girls. , every time I go to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, there are less than ten credits in my wallet, and I dare not even buy a one-credit ham sausage. , Touched the wallet again, but still gritted his teeth and refused.
"Could someone be joking with me?"
Looking at the familiar scene and his young self in the mirror, Shi Feng couldn't help but shook his head, denying this idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology. Who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Could it be that I was reborn?" Shi Feng joked with a wry smile on his face.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, it couldn't be April 2129 when he was still in his senior year.
Shi Feng shook his head, wanting to be more sober, but he still held a trace of expectation in his heart, hoping that he would be reborn and really return to ten years ago, so he walked to the computer desk and turned on the laptop.
If the time on a mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the Internet cannot be faked.
After a few minutes on the Internet.
Shi Feng was completely shocked. All the information he checked on the Internet showed that today is indeed April 19, 2129. Even the official opening time of the world's most popular God's Domain is clearly written on the official website, and the countdown is six days later. April 25th.
"Did I really go back ten years ago?" Shi Feng stared at the news reports of God's Domain, with tears of excitement in the corners of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood is indescribable, there are regrets, grief, and joy.
It was as if everything in front of me was a dream.
But the chirping of cicadas outside the window, as well as the cold air from the air conditioner, reminded Shi Feng that all of this was true.
Looking at the group photo of his family when he was in college on his mobile phone, Shi Feng never realized that his father has gray hair and his mother has wrinkles around her eyes. They are really old and not as full of vitality as before.
When he noticed that his parents were getting old, it was a year and a half after the opening of God's Domain. The high debt, heavy labor and pressure made both parents seriously ill. Several million credit points, but at that time Shi Feng was just a small leader of Youying, and the money he earned couldn't afford such an expensive fee.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried his best, but unfortunately it was not enough. Even though Shi Feng tried his best to maintain it, his parents still left after a few months.
Who knows the pain and regret that he didn't take good care of his parents in the last life?
Even after Shi Feng earned millions of credit points, this has become an eternal pain in Shi Feng's heart.
Unexpectedly, fate made such a joke on him, and he actually started from scratch and everything returned to the original point.
"Okay, that's great, hahaha. Now that I'm reborn, I have to change everything, earn enough money, cure my parents' illnesses, and stop them from working hard for their lives." Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, secretly swear.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Heizi called again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for assessment.
However, Shi Feng took his time, put on his clothes, and packed himself before heading to Gimhae University.
He is very familiar with the shadow.
I remember that when I was in college, the eldest son of Lanhua Group, Lan Hailong, opened the Shadow Studio and provided a lot of funds to organize the master students of Gimhae University to fight for God's Domain. At that time, he also went for the assessment and became the core member, Heizi became a peripheral member, and he was happy for a long time at that time.
Three years later, Youying Studio had his leadership, and the Lanhua Group made a lot of money in God's Domain, and became a big consortium. Unexpectedly, Lan Hailong personally fired him in the end.
Now that he is reborn, he still has an incomparable advantage over God's Domain, so he naturally doesn't plan to join the Shadow, become a tool for others, and make money for others. He wants to take a different path, fight for his own life, and don't let others Parents send living expenses and pay off all debts, so he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng came to Teaching Building No. 1, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking up and down the gate, extremely anxious. This person was Heizi.
"Brother Feng, you are finally here. Fortunately, the deadline for registration is not closed. Let's go in and register." Heizi said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head, and said very seriously: "Heizi, I'm not going to go to Youying anymore. I want to open my own studio. Are you coming?"
Heizi met in a virtual game, and his skills are very good. Afterwards, they ventured into the world together. They can be said to be brothers. In the days when Youying worked together, although Heizi did not have the ability to play games, the management was very strong. Hundreds of thousands of people in the guild The management is well organized. With the help of Heizi, the goal will be further achieved. However, he will follow Heizi’s choice. After all, he has nothing now, and Heizi’s family is not good. He decided to become a professional gamer for the sake of living, joining Shadow to earn living expenses.
After a full minute, Heizi looked up at Shi Feng.
"Brother Feng, don't be silly. Do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's 8,000 credits. To open a studio, you need at least six people. You also need a workplace, wages, etc. The start-up capital alone is 70,000 to 80,000, and there are follow-up investments, which is a lot of money, but do you have that much money now?" Heizi knew Shi Feng's situation very well, knew that Shi Feng's family was not well off, and wanted to persuade Shi Feng Feng Feng Feng gave up on this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy the virtual helmet of God's Domain now." Shi Feng nodded silently and admitted, as Heizi said, even 70,000 to 80,000 is less, remembering the work of a hundred people recruited by Lan Feilong The studio cost more than five million yuan, and later it spent a lot to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
"Since this is the case, why do we bother to take risks? Isn't it more stable to go to Phantom, at least Phantom can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become professional players." Heizi saw that Shi Feng understood The key to the problem, he breathed a sigh of relief, and pulled Shi Feng into the teaching building.
Shi Feng shook off Heizi's hand, looked at Heizi seriously, and said with a very serious expression: "But I still plan to open my own studio, and I don't want to be controlled by others. Come, Heizi?"
Shi Feng will not force Heizi, after all, he has no guarantee, and it is impossible to tell the secret that he is a reborn person. He only hopes that Heizi can believe him.
Seeing Shi Feng's serious expression, Heizi always feels that Shi Feng is very strange and crazy today. It is impossible to make money in the early stage of the virtual game. Everyone knows this. Is there any way for Shi Feng to make money in God's Domain? Even if they make money, it will be a few months later, and they don't have that much time to waste.
Heizi hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed: "I see, who told you to be the big brother, I will open a studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, we can't play games without the helmet?"
Shi Feng's frown suddenly relaxed, he patted Heizi's shoulder happily, and said with a smile: "This is my good brother, don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that God's Domain has a trial discount for college students. There are distribution places in every university. As long as you have a student ID card, you can get a virtual helmet for free trial for ten days. Let's take a look."
Heizi's dark face turned livid at this moment, feeling that the future is dark, why would he believe in Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng's self-confidence and stability? Is it really okay to start a business with Shi Feng?
What can ten days do in God's Domain?
In the past ten days, I will definitely miss the good time for major studios to recruit people. In the end, I still want to buy a virtual helmet, but how will the money come from?
If you want to earn 16,000 credit points in the ten days after God's Domain is opened, even a team of professional players can't do it!
"Leave the money to me."
Shi Feng patted Heizi's shoulder, showing a confident smile.
Earning 16,000 credits in ten days is whimsical, but he has the courage of a reborn person, no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break through one by one. And the opening of God's Domain was the beginning of his rise.
Afterwards, Shi Feng took Heizi to receive the trial helmet, and bought instant noodles with all the money, and put them next to the computer desk in the rented room. There were two big boxes, enough food for more than ten days, and then he explained some things about God's Domain , quietly waiting for the opening of God's Domain.
At nine o'clock in the evening on April 25th, there were a few faint lights flickering in the dark and quiet cabin.
Shi Feng lay quietly on the bed, closed his eyes, and lightly clicked the start button of the helmet.
"Shenyu, here I come."
I can't tell what kind of sound it is, but it seems that it can penetrate the body and rush into the soul in the ear, which makes people shiver involuntarily in this cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpered through the world, and the white snow fluttered with the wind, splitting the sky into fragments, and sprinkled the earth layer by layer. From a distance, it looked like it was covered in silver, and the land was desolate.
It's not late at night, it's just dusk, but the bleakness of the sky is the same as that of the night, giving people a heavy feeling, as if they are pressed against their hearts and can't breathe. On the silver land, a huge silhouette can be seen, it is a majestic city, as if a giant beast is approaching.
In the center of the city, there is a tall tower-like altar, which is in the shape of seven corners. The whole body is pitch-black and goes straight into the cloud peak. It stands towering and motionless in the strong wind and snowstorm. The whimpering wind on the altar is mixed with such a rattling sound, scattered into the distance, with primitive roughness, which has a special charm.
The hoarse murmuring voice floated from the altar in the wind and snow, and seemed to merge with the wind, and it was faintly indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where is the hope? If there is no hope, why let me see it!!" The voice seemed to be crazy, almost hysterical, roaring and whirling through the nine heavens.
Below the altar, there are countless figures in coir raincoats standing there silently. Looking from a distance, there are hundreds of thousands of them. There was fanaticism emerging, as if the person on the altar said a word, they could give everything for it.
Snow, bigger.
"Since you let me see it, there must be hope, but where is the hope..." The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, full of sadness, and lingered for a long time.
"Today's bright and yellow return wrongly, Santai opened up wasteland, and snow winds are coming. Once created in the ages, I will be considered a barbarian again!" The voice suddenly became louder, and I don't know what method I used, but I saw the situation in the sky. All the falling snowflakes stopped suddenly, and then all rolled back, whistling from all directions and gathered together, making the sky tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky that day, and all the snowflakes condensed to form a huge snow-colored black dragon. As soon as this dragon was formed, it immediately raised its head to the sky and hissed. It seemed to be torn apart by the sound.
Shocking bursts of fresh blood secreted from the snow dragon, soon permeating its whole body, making the snow dragon look like a blood dragon. It roared sternly, struggled and rushed towards the sky like a shooting star. Inserting into the sky, it seems that it wants to blast a hole in the sky and open up a hope.
Its speed was so fast that it was endless in a blink of an eye. During the roaring and whirling, it seemed that the dragon had collided with an invisible diaphragm somewhere, the sky and the earth shook, and the buzzing sound spread to all directions. Visible velocity layers collapse.
At the moment when it was about to be completely shattered, the hundreds of thousands of silent people under the altar all made a tactic with their hands, bit the tip of their tongue, and spewed out a mouthful of blood. The blood seemed to be drawn by some kind of force and galloped up. The sea of blood rose into the sky and went straight to the crumbling blood dragon. After merging with it, the dragon's collapse eased and it rushed to a higher sky.
Seeing that the blood dragon was flying higher and higher, it gathered everyone's eyes, but at this moment, the blood dragon's whole body shook violently, and after letting out a sharp hiss that spread tens of thousands of miles, it could no longer stop the movement of its body. It turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes, falling down, and from a distance, the world has been dyed into a red yellow spring.
Even at this moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, a voice that was completely different from Qihou came out of its mouth! "Shang..."
On the top of the altar, in the very center, sat cross-legged an old man in a purple robe. The old man's face was wrinkled and even covered with brown spots. He opened his eyes while murmuring, but his eyes were Bleak and obviously a blind man.
There is a complete spine in front of him, exuding a white light, holding a stone piece in his right hand, resting on the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes looked at the sky silently, for a long, long time, he let out a long sigh.
In his words, the right hand holding the stone flake moved again on the weird spine, rubbed against the animal bones, made a clicking sound, and scattered towards the distance. His figure was obviously bleak, unlike this The sound merged, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
In the middle of the night, it was pitch black, but the vast mountains were not calm, ferocious beasts came and went, their roars shook the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, and the leaves rustled down.
There was another beast roar, Lin Feng shrank his neck, brushed off the leaves that fell on his body, looked at the mountains in the darkness, and sighed inwardly, this place is really different from the earth.
Lin Feng was sitting under the tree in a daze, and the tough young men on the opposite side all looked at him with disdain, and a little fat man even shouted at Lin Feng: "Leaving you as a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat, hurry up and get to work!"
Lin Feng came back to his senses, did not speak, patted his buttocks, stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted: "Useless waste, whose physical strength is not as good as that of a child, he should be thrown into the mountains to be eaten by ferocious beasts!"
Lin Feng curled his lips, brother, a person from Earth who has traveled through time, how can he compare his physical strength with your group of animals?
This Tianyuan Great World is a world ruled by practitioners.
The wolf village in front of me is just a small village in the vast mountains. Naturally, there are no practitioners, but every villager practices martial arts hard and builds up their strength, even women and children are no exception.
Only in this way can one survive in this world where ferocious beasts are rampant and even ancient remnants appear.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village also go to the mountains to hunt. Many prey are used to coming out at night. Although going to the mountains at night is dangerous, the rewards will be even greater.
The people in the village are already used to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village don't sleep, they gather together to compete and play, waiting for their adults to return from hunting.
Children with clear noses are playing with stone locks weighing dozens of kilograms as toys, while a group of teenagers are competing to see who can lift the giant tripod weighing a thousand kilograms at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at the group of small animals and sighed secretly, comparing his strength with them, he really looked like a waste.
But this will not make Lin Feng feel depressed. Although he is talked about behind his back from time to time, he still temporarily lives in this small mountain village called Wolf Village by virtue of his trickery skills. What really hurt his ass was that there was one more thing in his mind.
Super Patriarch System.
At the beginning, Lin Feng was quite happy, thinking that time travel would be a benefit, but the system explained that the first item made him feel a bit cold.
"The main task of the system: the host establishes a sect, establishes the world's largest sect, and becomes the first patriarch."
"The main task is divided into different stages. Each stage must be completed within a limited time. If it is not completed within the time limit, the host will be directly obliterated!"
Lin Feng looked at the system description, especially the last sentence "kill the host", and was speechless for a long time, finally squeezed out a few words from between his teeth: "I bought a watch last year!"
After the anger passed, Lin Feng read the mission content helplessly. He was not going to take the risk of challenging the system to see if the other party could kill him. When he first came to this world, his ass was still hot, so he didn't want to die again.
Main task 1.0——Accept four disciples who passed on the mantle.
Mission description: Even if you are a casual cultivator, if you want to inherit your mantle, you must accept apprentices. The most important resource of a sect is always people, who are the disciples with outstanding talents. Famous teachers produce high-level apprentices. Famous teachers are hard to find, and high-level apprentices are even harder to find.
Task time limit: one year, if the overtime is not completed, the host will be directly obliterated.
"Damn it!" Lin Feng sighed, we, the newcomers who have just transmigrated, are immature like a refreshing cabbage, so I should hurry up and find a big cow to be my master, so I can hug my thighs, right?
Brother System, you at least give me a cheat book so that I can recruit apprentices. What do you want me to teach you, this poor man? Fudge and bragging?
Even worse, the system explained that there was a novice gift pack, but told himself that the gift pack system had malfunctioned, and the novice gift pack was delayed.
The open exchange system is full of all kinds of good things, such as panacea, magic weapon, and magical powers, which only you can't think of, and they are out of stock without him.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng doesn't even have any exchange points right now, so he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding his mother in his heart, when there was a commotion at the entrance of the village, it seemed that the hunting team had returned.
The teenagers waiting in the village cheered and greeted them towards the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced indifferently, but was surprised to find that all the young men who had returned from hunting had returned empty-handed, not to mention their prey, and even their weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are their second life. Living in this mountain, it is impossible to survive without weapons.
The corner of Lin Feng's mouth curled into an imperceptible smile: "There seems to be a story." Thinking of this, he also walked towards the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before I got close, I heard someone roaring: "Langfeng is the hope of our Wolf Village. Now he has been seriously injured by the people of Stone Village. We must not let it go!"
Lin Feng looked up, and saw a young man in the crowd sitting on the ground with a weary expression, his body was covered with scars, and his eyes were radiating hatred and cold light.
"Is this the genius that the people of Lang Village talk about?" Lin Feng observed stealthily. He has been famous for this wolf style for a long time. The idol of the youths in Lang Village is regarded as the hope of the village. Today Lin Feng is Meeting real people for the first time.
Although the wolf wind was injured and looked sluggish at this time, it was full of energy and blood. Although its physical strength could not be compared with that of a cultivator, it was definitely at the top among secular warriors.
According to the public opinion of the Tianyuan Great World, one can reach this level at a young age, and if one cultivates one's qi, one will have a bright future. After all, a cultivator guides the aura of heaven and earth into the body, condenses mana, and strengthens one's own foundation.
Lin Feng calmly called out his Super Patriarch System, which contained a disciple talent detector, and he pressed OK on Langfeng.
"The subject's aptitude is too low to become a direct disciple of the host."
Lin Feng frowned. This system is too picky. He originally thought of accepting four random disciples first, to fool the system with the one-year deadline, and at the end of the day, just expel these disciples who made up the numbers from the gate.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to take advantage of the loopholes in the system. Even a well-known talented boy like Langfeng is not qualified. It is really too difficult for Lin Feng to recruit all four disciples to complete the system tasks.
"One year, one year..." Lin Feng sighed depressingly.
Among the crowd, an old man next to Langfeng's face turned livid, and he snorted: "Langfeng is my grandson, of course we can't just leave this matter as it is, but it's not now. I'm about to be born, get the mountain treasure first, and then settle the score with Shicun!"
Lin Feng was not interested in the frequent fights between clans in the village. However, the word "Shan Bao" caught his ears and moved his heart slightly.
Lin Feng was thinking about Shanbao when he suddenly heard someone curse in a low voice: "I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster. It's not yet four years old. A little baby can defeat the genius wolf in our village." Wind, what a hell!"
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
A little baby less than four years old defeated the wolf wind in front of him?
Lang Feng already had some sort of talent, and the person who injured him was not even four years old, so what kind of talent should that be?
The little fat man beside Lin Feng cursed in a low voice: "Damn it, you must kill him!"
Glancing at him, Lin Feng echoed, "Yes, yes."
But I was thinking in my heart that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng calmly withdrew from the crowd. He wished he could grow his wings and fly to Stone Village immediately, but he didn't dare to leave the village alone, otherwise he would just go to feed the beasts in the mountains.
At this moment, a mechanical and dull notification sound suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"The novice gift pack is released, do you want to check it now?"
After Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, he was overjoyed. He had never felt that the boring and dull system notification sound was so pleasant to the ear.
Finding a place where no one was around, Lin Feng opened the gift bag.
Novice Gift Package: The host obtains the fourth-level state of the basic cultivation base and Qi training period, a chance to draw a lottery, get 300 exchange points, get the Taoist secret book "Nine Heavens Thunder Correction", and get the supernatural power Nine Heavens Moving Thunder.
Lin Feng was dumbfounded, a warm current fell from the top of his head, pierced directly between his chest and abdomen, and quickly opened a hidden acupuncture point in his body.
There are twelve important acupoints hidden in the human body, which are called the twelve-story building by practitioners.
The practice of Qi training period is divided into twelve floors, which is to open the twelve floors. When each acupuncture point is opened, the aura will be transformed into mana, and the practitioner's mana will rise to a higher level.
Right now Lin Feng felt a warm current, walking all the way, until he opened up the four acupoints in his body before disappearing. Following Lin Feng's breathing, the vitality of the outside world was quickly sucked into his body, and circled in the four opened acupoints.
Each acupoint is like a star cluster universe that is constantly running, and the aura is continuously transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just like the beginning of the universe and the evolution of all creatures.
Lin Feng felt that his whole body became lighter, and with a thought, mana flowed from the acupoints like a spring, and explosive power was about to move.
It took a long time before Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and he felt relieved: "Finally, I have the power to protect myself." But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system is to establish the first sect in history, and he himself wants to become the first patriarch in history, Lin Feng suddenly felt a sense of relief. I was under a lot of pressure, so I hurriedly checked other items in the novice gift pack.
"Lucky draw chance?" Lin Feng looked at it. In addition to the exchange system, there is also a lottery system in the auxiliary training system, but it is grayed out and is not yet activated, so don't think about it for now.
At present, I can only hope that the purchasing power of the 300 exchange points will be higher.
While thinking about it, Lin Feng joined the exchange system. He was poor and white before, so he didn't even have the heart to look at the price.
Taking a closer look at the price, Lin Feng cursed the system for being unscrupulous. The lowest-level bottle of Qi Yang Dan cost ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual iron-smelting sword cost thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic outfit, a set of feather clothes and a star crown, you need fifty points.
The most basic supernatural powers such as "fireball" and "palm thunder" cost a hundred points.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros hanging on the back, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them for fear of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "Existing Exchange Points" column, and shook his head: "The starting capital is too little."
Fortunately, the novice gift pack contained a secret book of Taoism and a supernatural power, otherwise Lin Feng would really be caught blind.
Taoism is the foundation of practice, mainly to improve the realm, while supernatural powers are practical martial arts or spells with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa in the gift package is of such a high grade that the existing exchange system cannot even be exchanged, and the system must be upgraded before it can be exchanged.
As for the system upgrade, it will only be activated after Lin Feng completes a certain number of system tasks. It is still too early to say.
Nine Heavens Thunder Correction is one of the top lightning-type Taoisms in this Tianyuan Great World, but it has been lost for many years, and the seniors who have successfully practiced it in the past are all masters walking sideways by virtue of this Taoism.
According to the instructions, the novice gift pack randomly opened a kind of Taoism, which could reveal the Nine Heavens Thunder Dharma. Lin Feng was considered to be smoking from his ancestral grave. Although the purchasing power of 300 exchange points was limited, Lin Feng's depression was swept away at this time.
For such a top-notch book of Taoism, if there was no damn main quest, Lin Feng would definitely find a place where no one was around to practice his magic skills before coming out to kill the world.
But now that he was going to recruit apprentices, that was another way of saying it.
Dissatisfaction was dissatisfaction, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and acted quickly.
He remained calm, and after asking the way to Stone Village, he quietly left Wolf Village without disturbing others.
The two villages are currently hostile. Lin Feng, who has become a cultivator, is not afraid of the people of Lang Village making trouble, but he is afraid that they will reveal his identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, the villagers of Lang Village are now gathered at the entrance of the village, because there is a lot of discussion about Lang Feng's injury, Lin Feng walked out from behind the village, and no one noticed his movements.
Walking on the road, without any hesitation, Lin Feng directly invested in fifty exchange points to buy himself an outfit.
How could Lin Feng from the earth not know the truth that "Buddhas need gold clothes, people need clothes". If you want to sell something, you must first do a good job in publicity and packaging.
Looking down at his feathered star crown and white robe with wide sleeves, Lin Feng nodded in satisfaction. The system items are expensive, but the quality and appearance are really undeniable.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing he saw was half a huge dead tree. The diameter of the trunk was more than ten meters, and the whole body was scorched black.
Lin Feng took a look and speculated that it was a lightning-struck tree. It was struck by lightning many years ago, and the huge canopy and vigorous vitality of the old tree were destroyed. Now there is only a stump 89 meters high on the ground.
But just looking at the size of the existing trunk, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead tree was scorched black, with no signs of life at all.
At this time, an old man came over, coughed and said, "This tree has been withered for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng, looked Lin Feng up and down with a pair of eyes: "The little old man is the villager of this stone village. Chief, is there anything I can do to help this Taoist chief?"
Lin Feng smiled slightly, his body naturally exuded an aura of arrogance, coupled with an outfit, a white robe with wide sleeves, and a feathered star crown, his appearance was not picky at all, he was definitely an outsider.
"Find the target, suitable to become the host's direct disciple."
Just as Lin Feng was about to speak, he heard the system notification sound suddenly, and he almost choked on his saliva.
The old village chief of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but trembled in fright.
I saw Lin Feng's eyes glowing green, staring at the entrance of the village like a hungry wolf howling.
At the entrance of the village, a snow-white and cute child carved with jade pecks is struggling to pull the tail of a big yellow dog. The child's voice is clear and loud: "Yeah, yip, don't run!"
The system beeped in Lin Feng's mind non-stop: "The talent system has been sorted out, and the information on No. 1 target is as follows."
"Gengu —> 10; Comprehension —> 8; Mind —> 8; Fortune —> 8."
"Summary: The target's talent is extremely high. It is recommended to be a disciple of the sect and teach him carefully. He will definitely be the pillar of the sect."
Lin Feng didn't see anything else, his eyes were fixed on the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
10 root bone, what does it mean?
For example, when someone else is running, it takes 100 meters from the starting point to the finishing point. If the finishing point is the same, this little guy starts running from 90 meters away!
No wonder, no wonder that wolf wind that he could beat up before he was four years old was full of peach blossoms.
The little one also found Lin Feng at this time, looked over with a blank face, blinking big eyes, full of cuteness.
Lin Feng smacked his lips. Not only is this guy so strong, his comprehension, determination, and fortune are all at the level of super geniuses.
Isn't it a bit stressful to accept such a guy as an apprentice?
As Lin Feng pondered, a warm and sunny smile gradually appeared on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in his previous life saw him showing such a smile, he would immediately hide as far away as possible.
Chapter 1
The morning sunlight, coming in through the light silver veil, just fell on the bed, piercing her eyes so much that she could hardly keep her eyes open.
At the party last night, she drank too much in a moment of joy, and it was Lu Yanchen who picked her up later.
Shi Guang sat up, the thin silk quilt slipped off, revealing a tinge of red on the white sheet, and hickey marks all over his greasy white skin.
From this look, one can tell that it is the result of a night of carnival.
"I love you."
When the love is strong, his touching love words seem to still be in my ears. Shi Shi's face was full of peach blossoms, his eyes were shy, and he turned his head to look around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Shi Guang lifted the quilt and got out of bed, when his legs touched the ground, he became weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the time came out again, Lu Yanchen also came back, and walked slowly into the living room leisurely, with a slender and straight figure carrying a strong and oppressive aura.
When Shi Shi raised his eyes, he fell into a pair of deep eyes, his eyes were as calm as an unfathomable clear pool.
After all, it was the first time that such an intimate relationship happened, Shi Shi was inexplicably shy, and lowered his eyes and dared not look at him.
When she was in a daze, she vaguely heard him say that he wanted to give her a surprise.
Are you going to propose to her?
Shi Shi was a little overwhelmed, and his heart was beating wildly.
As soon as she spoke, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice: "Let's break up!"
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he wanted to give her was to break up?
Is he teasing her, joking, or seriously, breaking up?
There was a cry of extreme pain, which was hidden in the throat and could not be uttered. It took a long time for Shi Shi to find his own voice.
Very light, very light, as if low in the dust. "Break up, after our relationship... Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?"
Lu Yanchen's indifferent expression didn't change a bit, "Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who hugged me tightly and told me not to stop. You also enjoyed last night."
Time is stunned like being struck by lightning!
She was dumbfounded, looking at this man who was completely different from what she remembered, she couldn't help trembling all over, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why?"
After speaking, he turned and looked out the window with a faint smile on his lips.
In the eyes of time, that smile looks like a mockery.
Shi Guang's face was as pale as snow, and the sharp pain started from the heart, pressing on the nerve endings and spreading to all the limbs, and the dizzy darkness hit her. Her fingertips pinched her palm tightly to prevent herself from fainting.
The air suddenly became cold and damp, making people shiver and suffocate, making them unable to stay for a minute.
Time passed.
Chapter 1
Yuguo, Lingjia, Cangyun Town, the moon passes through the sky.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally be sure that he was indeed reincarnated and reborn.
For a strong man in the Heaven-Human Realm, it took ten seconds to confirm one thing. This is absolutely unbelievable, but it also proves how unbelievable what happened to him.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and even had unprecedented achievements in alchemy. The "Three Fire Yin" technique he created triggered a revolution in the alchemy world, and he was honored as the "Emperor of Alchemy".
But he was not satisfied, and wanted to go one step further, reaching the legendary Shattering Void Realm, shattering the void and turning mortals into gods. To this end, he visited countless ancient sites, and finally entered the Black Blood Valley, and found a mysterious ancient tower after going through many dangers.
He did not disappoint, the golden words floating on the ancient pagoda are a supreme exercise called "The Indestructible Heavenly Scripture". When practiced to the highest level, the body will be indestructible and immortal. Same birthday!
But even with the martial arts practiced in the Linghan Heavenly Human Realm, he still feels that the "Indestructible Heavenly Scripture" is obscure and difficult to understand, as if he is reading a book from heaven, and has no clue at all.
He forcibly memorized this exercise, and when he was about to study the ancient pagoda, the ancient pagoda vibrated lightly, releasing a beam of immeasurable divine light, which instantly shattered his body. But the strange thing is that his soul did not dissipate, and fell into a state of half-waking, half-awakening, dream-like, which lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul has been pondering the Immortal Scripture—he can't do anything else except this. After ten thousand years, he finally comprehended the first level of this exercise.
It took ten thousand years for a strong man in the realm of heaven and man to comprehend the first stage of a practice. What kind of concept is this?
You must know that the strong in the Heavenly Human Realm usually have a lifespan of less than a thousand years. Normally, no one in the world can cultivate the Immortal Scripture, because they have already died of old age before they even started.
But Ling Han mastered the first level of the "Indestructible Heavenly Scripture" in this weird way, and then he suddenly came alive and was reincarnated in a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"No matter what happened, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only at the second level of body refining, and it is so useless that it can no longer be used up, I was once a strong man in the realm of heaven and man, standing at the top of martial arts, and a master of alchemy. With pills to make up for it, I don't believe that I can't return to the peak."
"Moreover, I can finally practice the Immortal Scripture. This is a supreme skill. It may even... maybe not belong to the mortal world, but from the legendary God Realm. Otherwise, how could it take 10,000 years to understand the first one?"
"In this life, I will definitely be able to surpass my predecessors and become a god!"
"Also, what's the matter with this body? I only reached the second level of body training at the age of sixteen. Is it because the current martial arts are too withered?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into my mind, which belonged to another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in this process, two completely different people merged together, regardless of each other.
"I see."
Ling Han nodded in his heart, the reason why he is now on the second level of body refining is because his spiritual roots are too poor.
If you want to practice to become a warrior, there is a prerequisite, that is, you must have a spiritual root. Only with the spiritual root can one absorb the spiritual energy from the heaven and the earth, temper one's own body, and turn it into one's own primordial power.
Some spiritual roots absorb spiritual energy quickly, while others are slow. Therefore, spiritual roots are divided into four major grades: heaven, earth, black and yellow. The lowest grade is the worst.
The key to judging the quality of a spiritual root lies in its purity. The purer the better, but Ling Han's spiritual root has both five elements and is the most messy. It can only be said to be reluctant, so he is sixteen years old but he has only cultivated to the second level of body training, and his peers have reached the fourth and fifth levels of body training.
Ling Han in his previous life was a heavenly spirit root, and he was also a heavenly top-grade nine-yang fire spirit root. Coupled with his unmatched alchemy talent, he reached the heavenly level in just two hundred years with alchemy as a supplementary weapon. Human realm, this is an unprecedented record.
"The five-element miscellaneous spirit root, this is the lowest level of spirit root. No wonder the predecessor, although working extremely hard, has only reached the second level of body refinement." "Although the five-element miscellaneous spirit root is a bit tricky for me, supplemented by elixir, at most four hundred years I will definitely be able to return to the peak!"
"Huh!"
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, with an unbelievably shocked expression on his face. He was stunned for a while, and then re-examined the spiritual root in his dantian with powerful soul power. The shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not the mixed spiritual root of the five elements. The five elements are completely balanced, forming a dao lotus! This is the chaotic lotus of the five elements, the best of the best, even rarer than the nine-yang fire root, and can be called a god-level spiritual root!" The predecessor's cultivation was slow because the god-level spiritual roots required special exercises to display their true power."
"And I... just mastered a five-element celestial skill that matches the five-element chaotic lotus!"
"One hundred years! No, it only takes fifty years for me to reach the realm of heaven and man again!"
Rao Yi couldn't help but show joy in Ling Han's cultivation base in the Heavenly Human Realm in his previous life. The spiritual root is destined to be born and cannot be changed the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, in order to break through the emptiness and become a god, he visited countless ancient sites and obtained a large number of secret skills, and the Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Kung Fu is one of them.
In the previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and in this life, he will create another glory and create an immortal myth.
"How did the predecessor die?"
Ling Han picked up the memory, and soon he revealed an angry face.
Formerly the only son of Ling Dongxing, the patriarch of the Ling family, his mother, grandparents passed away very early. And the Ling family is a family of martial arts. Every member of the clan practices martial arts and respects martial arts. How can someone like Ling Dong act as the head of the family? It's because of his strongest strength.
But because of Ling Han's problem with his spiritual root, he was regarded as a waste material since he was a child, and he got all eyes on him.
In order to fight for a bright future for his son, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang Academy - Huyang Academy will recruit Ling Han as a disciple and train him with all his strength, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing will enter Ziguang Valley, Find something lost long ago for Huyang Academy.
Huyang Academy was established by the Yuguo Dynasty and has countless resources. If it is cultivated with all its strength, no matter how useless it is, it can be promoted to the Juyuan Realm.
But it's impossible for the people of Huyang Academy to be idiots. If that thing is easy to get, how could they be willing to offer such a favorable condition?
The Ziguang Valley is full of dangers, and one wrong step may result in death. However, for the sake of his son, Ling Dongxing set off without hesitation seven days ago.
Yesterday, people from Huyang College came and informed the Ling family that they would pick them up today as agreed. But at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the chief deacon of the Ling family, came over to discuss with his predecessor, asking him to give up this precious quota to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with a bright future. Such an opportunity cannot be wasted by a waste material.
Naturally, the predecessor would not agree, this is an opportunity his father bought with his life! But Ling Chongkuan said it was a discussion, but in fact he was just informing his predecessor, and he didn't take his opinion to heart at all.
The predecessor couldn't bear to attack, but Ling Zhongkuan is a strong man in the Yuan Gathering Realm, and he can suppress him with one finger, so how can he be an opponent?
With just one punch, his predecessor was seriously injured, and then he was locked in his room, obviously not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people of Huyang Academy. And when Ling Dongxing came back, it was a done deal.
And the predecessor of Heavy Injury was just so angry to death.
Ling Han snorted, he was really deceiving people too much, the quota that his father risked his life for was actually snatched away by Ling Zhongkuan's grandfather and grandson like this?
This pair of shameless dogs!
Can't bear it!
He got up from the bed, and suddenly felt sore all over his body—he was alive, but the injuries on his body would not heal without reason.
"The spiritual root is still wounded!" Ling Han frowned, Ling Chongkuan's blow had caused damage to his spiritual root, and the wounded spiritual root is a very troublesome thing, ordinary healing stones are ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of elixir that can repair the spiritual root, but the materials needed for the four are too expensive, and even if the entire Ling family is sold, they can't be exchanged for it—and my spiritual root is only affected. Light wounds don't need such high-level pills."
"The remaining three, two of which need to be refined into pills, which are too much for me at the second level of body refining. Then there is only one choice-Yuanxin Fuling Powder, which only needs to be prepared in proportion , boil it into concoction."
"Heal the injury first, and then stop Ling Chongkuan and grandpa. Although I don't care about this quota, I will never let my father sacrifice his life for the opportunity to take advantage of this shameless grandpa and grandson!"
He sat down cross-legged and started to run the "Indestructible Scripture".
This is the first time he has practiced this possibly god-level skill, but because he has been pondering it for tens of thousands of years, he is extremely calm in controlling it now.
Humming buzzing, a powerful vitality suddenly arose in his body, and his energy was consumed a lot, but the injury recovered quickly.
In just a few minutes, his injuries were gone.
"As expected of the Immortal Scripture, I have such miraculous effects at the very beginning of my practice. It's just that this is completely different from other exercises. The normal exercise is to use the spiritual root to transform the aura of heaven and earth into Yuanli, but the Immortal Scripture is On the contrary, tempering the body with Yuanli can also heal injuries."
"After reaching the highest level, immortality is not impossible." "That's why it can be called the heavenly scripture!" "It's a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I can restore all the spiritual roots with the immortal scripture."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the gradually whitening sky outside the window, and murmured: "Now, it's time to meet that shameless old fellow Ling Chongkuan and give him a surprise."
He put on his shoes, went to the door, and opened it.
Immediately a tall figure appeared at the door and blocked his way. This person was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Chongkuan's lackeys.
"Master Han, the chief deacon has ordered you to stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan said with a chuckle. Although the person opposite is the son of the head of the family, he is notoriously useless. In his eyes, it is just a joke.
Ling Han's eyes turned cold, and he said, "How dare you stop me?"
You are the one who stopped you, the head deacon said, you must not let Ling Han make trouble today, if necessary, you can just beat him up! Zhang Yuanpi smiled and said: "This is the order of the chief deacon, please Master Han not to embarrass me."
Ling Chongkuan, an old dog, is really cautious. He is still worried about beating him seriously, and even sent someone to guard the gate, and this can also show how important it is for Ling Chongkuan to let his grandson enter Huyang Academy—but when this hope is dashed, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and annoyance can be imagined.
"Get out!" Ling Han said coldly.
Snapped!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped him across the face, and said coldly: "What are you, tell you to get out?"
What, I was slapped by a piece of trash? Zhang Yuan caressed his face in disbelief, this trash dared to shoot at him, and even hit him, what kind of joke is this?
Snapped!
Ling Han waved his hand again, and slapped him firmly again.
"BAA Baa baa baa--"
The sound of an acoustic sheep cry echoed through the silent mountains.
Li Qiye climbed up the hill, the night wind was strong and cold, but at this moment, he was sweating from anxiety. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the mountain with hands and feet, and the night looked particularly lonely and pitiful, which made people's hair stand on end.
Although the night looked terrifying, Li Qiye was burning with anxiety in his heart.
Li Qiye, he was born in a family of tenant farmers, his parents were poor people, he started to herd sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herded the sheep as usual, but when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that a sheep was missing. , did not find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of Zhang Dahu's landlord, who lost a sheep, Li Qiye was very anxious and panicked.
Now that the entire hill has been searched, there is no sign of the sheep. At this time, Li Qiye thought of one place, but there was only one place that he did not search for - the Immortal Demon Cave!
Looking up at the night in the valley in front of him, it looks like a prehistoric beast, opening its mouth wide to eat at any time, and faintly hearing the sound of wolves crying and ghosts, and looking at the blurred night of the fairy cave, Li Qiye couldn't help but I shuddered.
Immortal Demon Cave, a place that has a bad reputation in the local area. It is said that there is a demon living in it. Anyone who enters will be eaten. After entering, no one can come out alive.
However, at this moment, the sound of Zhang Dahu's crackling whip echoed in Li Qiye's ears. If he lost a sheep, Zhang Dahu would definitely beat him to pieces!
"Okay, okay, okay, I have finally made the immortal Dark Crow, only the soul is missing, and I just want to borrow your soul today!" After an unknown amount of time, a deep and gloomy voice sounded from the Immortal Demon Cave.
"Pa-pa-pa-pa--" Not long after, there was a rapid flapping of wings, and a crow-like strange bird flew out of the fairy cave.
"Fly, fly, I want to use your soul to remember the burial place and fly over the relics. As long as the Nine Realms are still there, I must find it!" A deep and gloomy voice echoed in the fairy cave.
From then on, a dark crow soared between heaven and earth, entered the burial ground, entered the fairy city, and crossed the realm of evil... Involuntarily, it flew across the Nine Realms, survived all kinds of hardships, and survived for millions of years!
As time goes by and times change, invincible figures rise one after another, while giants fall one after another. Slowly, I don't know when, a mysterious crow began to appear for a while, a mysterious crow that got rid of the confinement, and began to look for the way to control his own destiny.
From the God of Medicine, to Immortal Emperor Fei, then to Immortal Emperor Xuexi, then to Immortal Emperor Mingren, then to Immortal Emperor Tunri, then to Immortal Emperor Bingyu... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants have risen, and generations of gods have fallen away. However, across thousands of years, that crow still faintly appears in the long river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and the snow was flying.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw that he was sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, the carriage was shaking a little, and there was the voice of a little girl talking softly beside him.
Outside the carriage, there was a lot of noisy voices. There are cries, shouts, and cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew that he couldn't go back. From an old man who was working in a state-owned enterprise waiting to die, he woke up to this world after getting drunk.
It's been five days so far.
He sniffed his nose, the air smelled of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit.
"Oh, the white osmanthus wine in the osmanthus workshop is getting more and more fragrant." Xiaoqiao, the personal maid in the carriage, said in a milky voice.
Coupled with her natural baby face, she is also small in stature. It looks like a ten-year-old child.
The little face is chubby, rosy, wearing a small green cotton skirt, and the little hands are still rubbing the hair rope that Lu Sheng is about to get out of the car to tie his hair.
This kind of hair rope is made of a very expensive bark, which will naturally emit a light fragrance, but the only disadvantage is that it will harden when it is cold, and it needs to be rubbed with hot hands to soften it.
Lu Sheng smiled, but didn't speak. The carriage stopped quickly.
He opened the curtain and got out of the car. The gray-white street was paved with bluestone bricks, each of which was the size of a washbasin.
There were cars and cars on the street, and there were people leading horses to and fro. The hawkers and the girls and female relatives who came out to hang out were not shy, and they laughed coquettishly in public.
Lu Sheng looked up at the wine shop in front of him. The white plaque is in the shape of a rectangle, with three big characters written in the middle of the dragon and phoenix dancing: Osmanthus Square.
"Come inside, please! The A-size wing room is reserved for you!" A servant came up to greet him with a smile on his face.
Lu Sheng nodded, acting like a rich man, took the silver-edged white paper fan from Xiao Qiao's hand, shook it lightly, and the fan unfolded, on which was a picture of mountains and rivers, mountains and rivers rising and falling, overlapping light and dark, and At a glance, it is the inscription of everyone's demeanor.
He followed the boy into the winery with ease.
The wine shop is divided into two floors. There are many people sitting in the lobby on the first floor listening to people singing.
A girl in green clothes stood crisply in the empty space, her voice was melodious, and there was a middle-aged woman playing a pipa beside her.
The song is a biography of Sanhui, which is about the poignant love between the expedition general and the mountain fox girl.
It's a pity that the drinkers present are all rough people. Only a few literati can still understand, and the rest turn a blind eye to the two young girls.
Lu Sheng stopped in his tracks, seeing how lively the first floor was, he simply found an empty seat on the first floor and sat down.
"Who ordered the biography of the three sessions?" He casually asked the servant.
His status in this sweet-scented osmanthus shop is different. If this sweet-scented osmanthus shop is equivalent to a high-end entertainment club on earth, then he is the supreme VIP customer here.
This kind of expenses is already considered a top customer in a small northern city like Jiulian City.
"It's Young Master Zhou. Zhou Que, Young Master Zhou."
Lu Sheng didn't make things difficult for him, so he let him go with a wave.
After pulling Xiaoqiao to sit down, he glanced around the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale and thin young man, dressed in white, holding a golden lotus-leaf folding fan with a bag in his hand, lightly rocking.
"I guess I fell in love with that little singing girl again." Lu Sheng shook his head.
"The eldest son just warned him last time, this guy is really a bad guy!" Xiao Qiao pouted dissatisfiedly.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Start listening to the music quietly.
A table of wine and food was quickly served on the dark red wooden table. Lu Sheng picked up a pinch of fried shredded pork with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of white cinnamon wine that is almost like a drink. The light sweet and floral aroma is mixed together, just like drinking fruit juice.
In Snow City of the Northland, the ice shrimp is a specialty here. If you fish it in the thick ice hole, you can get a lot of translucent shrimp.
The body length of ice shrimp is half that of ordinary shrimp, but its taste is extremely delicious.
Of course the price is also very expensive.
Eating once a month is considered a luxury for ordinary people, where can you have every meal like him.
While Lu Sheng was eating delicious food, drinking fine wine, and listening to a little song, he was thinking about other things.
It has been so many days since he came to this world similar to ancient China. But according to his observation, the world has many oddities.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but then he found out that he was not.
The customs and festival climate here are far different from any dynastic region he knows.
Thinking about something, the door of the winery opened again.
A group of strong men in short jackets walked in one after another, found a table near the corner and sat down.
These strong men were not locals at a glance. Their clothes looked more like they came from the Central Plains, and their clothes were not as rough as those in the Northland.
The brawny man at the head had a bald head, copper earrings, and a fleshy face, but at this moment he was moaning. ""
"Brother, what are you worried about? We can't get through Li's Village. We can take the second route. It's also okay to take a detour from Zhang Village." Another man frowned.
"What do you know? When I came to meet up, I walked from Zhang Village. The situation is similar to that of Lijia Village. Many people died."
"What's going on, brother, tell the brothers to hear it, and let us gain insight." A man urged.
The bald man sighed again. "I don't know exactly what happened. I only know that there have been accidents in several fishing villages by Suiyang Lake. It seems that there are water ghosts."
"? Isn't it?"
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and they could hear their undisguised chat.
Originally, he was just listening to it for fun, but he didn't expect these people to chat about supernatural things.
The Lu family in his current life is one of the most powerful families in this northern ice city, and their wealth is still small.
If you compare it on the earth, it is at least a rich person with assets exceeding 100 million.
When he went out to drink these few days, he also heard a lot of rumors about monsters, gods and ghosts in the wine shop, but most of them were legends.
This is the first time that these people have had such a personal experience. So Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
Fortunately, those few people did not hide it. Continue to chat loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes. It's more than ten feet tall, with a blue face and long fangs, covered with a lot of water plants. Be good, if it weren't for your big brother, I can run fast, and now you don't even want to see me." I still have lingering fears.
"Brother, do water ghosts really exist?" A man didn't believe it.
"I'm afraid it's not the story you made up, brother?"
Lu Sheng also found it funny when he heard this, probably some brash braggart came out of nowhere. During this period of time, he had seen a lot of people like this.
After eating and drinking, he asked the boy to bring over the showgirl's playlist, and browsed at will.
Although the biography of the Three Sessions was good, it was not suitable for the occasion, so he planned to change it to a more cheerful one.
Snapped!
But at this moment, the bald man blushed and slapped the table.
"A bone that the water ghost fell on the ground! I picked it up secretly afterwards!"
He carefully took out a jade-like green stone from his arms and slapped it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of miscellaneous jade!" A man laughed.
"Miscellaneous jade? This is miscellaneous jade?
"This brother, can you show me this thing."
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood by the table with a smile on his face, his eyes swept over the green jade on the table.
"This thing, how dare you want it? It's something left by the water ghost." The bald man said in surprise.
He just took it out now, and planned to throw it away in a while.
After all, this is not something left by people. If you really want to attract water ghosts to make trouble, then the loss outweighs the gain.
"I'll just take a look." Lu Sheng didn't believe in water ghosts, he just saw that the jade looked good, not like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
You must know that general miscellaneous jade can be bought everywhere in the shops and stalls. The scraps of jade are polished at will, and the price is extremely cheap.
But for some reason, when he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
She was dressed in white fox fur in Tsing Yi, wore a sapphire official hat, and black-soled boots with moiré patterns embroidered with silver thread.
All the clothes can be spent in this osmanthus workshop for several months. It is even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
"My lord, it's not impossible, um... just a tael of silver!"
Lu Sheng asked Xiaoqiao to take out a piece of silver and put it on the table.
The bald head decisively picked up the jade and stuffed it into Lu Sheng's hand. Several people exchanged glances, got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't speak, and watched them leave, holding the jade in his hand, and took a closer look.
"That means he can be so rich and powerful in this life." He shook his head, a tael of silver was nothing to him, according to the memory of this body, his daily expenses in a month were at least more than a hundred taels of silver. Occasionally there are many, and it may cost thousands of taels.
Thinking of this, he thought to himself that he was a prodigal.
Holding the jade, he ignored the eyes of the guests watching the excitement, but left the winery with Xiao Qiao on his feet, and walked towards the waiting carriage outside.
But just after he left the winery, before walking halfway, he was startled suddenly, picked up the jade and put it in the palm of his hand.
The jade was in the palm of his hand, in the palm of his right hand, and it actually melted.
The originally hard stone turned into a ball of dark green mucus in just a few seconds, and a scream came from the mucus.
The whole mucus exploded suddenly, turning into a cloud of green smoke, which slowly drifted away from Lu Sheng.
He stood there stunned, and when he glanced at it, the jade was still in his hand, but the green color inside had quietly disappeared at some point.
He stood there in a daze, constantly recalling the previous scene for a while.
Xiao Qiao kept calling him from the side.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses, and looked at the jade in his hand, it was just an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
"Let's go, go back to the house!"
The two got into the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and whipped it a few times, and the two long-haired black horses started to walk slowly.
In the carriage, Lu Sheng kept looking at the pebbles in his hand without saying a word. Xiaoqiao also noticed the strangeness of the stone at this time.
"I've been fooled again!" She murmured in her heart, not saying much, the eldest son is not bad this time, the biggest time he was cheated before was for a so-called antique jug, which cost thousands of taels of silver , almost pissed off the master. This time it was only a tael of silver, and sometimes the young master would spend more than that for a meal.
The carriage went all the way home. When passing by the gate of the city, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting outside.
".....I heard that the water ghost was eliminated before! A wandering Taoist took action to relieve the danger of the fishing village!"
"Has anyone come from the court?"
"It's early. I heard that even the Ouyang catcher of the magistrate's yamen in the city almost fell into it. Fortunately, I met a Taoist wandering in the sky. It is said that when the Taoist made a move, there was a golden light flashing, and the water ghost screamed when he was in the warehouse. Green slime, then exploded into a cloud of smoke."
"of course not!"
Lu Sheng heard that it was the officers guarding the city gate chatting.
He would pass by the city gate on purpose from time to time. The officers and soldiers here are well-informed, and they all like to brag about strange things everywhere.
"It's a coincidence..." Lu Sheng remained calm.
He recalled the piece of jade before, and his heart sank.
In the autumn of 9999 in the Chinese calendar, Donghai, Qingzhou City.
The Qingzhou Academy, the Holy Land of Qingzhou City, the wealthy nobles of Qingzhou City, and more than half of the powerhouses in the Zongmen family all came out of the Qingzhou Academy. Therefore, people in Qingzhou City are proud of being able to enter the palace to practice, and once they have the opportunity to step into the palace, they must study hard.
However, not everyone seems to have this awareness. At this time, in a dormitory of Qingzhou Academy, there was a young man lying on the table and sleeping soundly.
Above the lecture hall, a girl in a long dress in blue also noticed this scene, with a look of anger on her pretty face, she walked towards the sleeping boy.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, official student of Qingzhou College, lecturer of outer disciples, has a beautiful face and a hot figure. In the school dormitory, pairs of eyes moved with Qin Yi's moving figure. Even if she was angry, Qin Yi's steps were still graceful.
"This guy is actually sleeping in Senior Sister Qin's lecture hall again." It seemed that he had just noticed the sleeping figure, and many teenagers around were a little speechless. Obviously, this was not the first time.
"With Senior Sister Qin's appearance and figure, even just looking at her is pleasing to the eye. What is that guy pretending to be?"
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer, not one of them. As for the reason, as long as you see her, you can understand. I don’t know how many people regard her as a goddess. Her lecture halls are always full of students. until.
Qin Yi's steps were very light, and she didn't make a sound when she walked to the boy's side. She stood in front of the table, looking at the sleeping face in front of her, her beautiful face was covered with frost.
"Ye Futian." A soft voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
As if he heard someone calling him in his sleep, Ye Futian moved his body, propped his head with his hands, and slowly opened his eyes. Under his hazy eyes, he saw undulating peaks and mountains.
"It's so big." Ye Futian couldn't help whispering. His voice was very soft, as if he was talking to himself. However, in the quiet environment at the moment, the voice still seemed particularly abrupt. In just a moment, many gazes It froze in the air, and then turned into anger again.
"How dare he... blatantly belittle Senior Sister Qin?"
The angry eyes seemed to turn into sharp swords, making Ye Futian shudder, as if something was wrong, his eyes moved up the alluring place, and then saw a delicate jade-like face full of anger.
"Eh..." Ye Futian's face was black, why is it Qin Yi?
Looking back, he saw a fifteen-year-old innocent girl glaring at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, and then cursed inwardly, "It's a terrible victim, no wonder the size is wrong.
"Senior Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian." Qin Yi interrupted him indifferently, and said, "In what context was the Qingzhou Academy founded?"
Obviously, Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and change the subject, but Ye Futian could clearly feel her anger at the moment. He even faintly felt wisps of sword intent flowing from Qin Yi's body, sharp and piercing. It hurt every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, Emperor Donghuang unified Eastern Shenzhou and ordered the princes of the world to establish the Wufu Academy and prosper martial arts. It was against this background that the Qingzhou Academy was established." Ye Futian responded, of course what he said was the official history. There is another name in the unofficial history he saw in the family. However, that taboo name is never allowed to be mentioned.
"What occupations are there in cultivation?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Cultivation can be divided into martial arts and magic arts. There are many professions in martial arts such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen. Those who practice magic arts have many professions such as mages, alchemists, and weapon refiners. And mages are divided into many departments. Of course, there are also talents. Those who practice both martial arts." Ye Futian responded.
"You seem to have missed a profession." Qin Yi asked seriously with a solemn expression.
There was a divine radiance on the young man's face: "The most powerful profession recognized by China, those who are favored by the heavens, the destiny mages, possess the talents bestowed by the gods. Those with rare talents, such as summoners, beast masters, astrologists, and peerless masters. Most of them come from the destiny mages. No matter how they practice martial arts, they can have stronger talents than others."
All the people around are fascinated, destiny mage, legendary profession, bear the destiny, be favored by God. "Not only that, even a Destiny Mage is naturally suitable for both martial arts and martial arts."
Qin Yi looked longingly, then looked at the young man in front of him, and said angrily: "I didn't expect you to know a lot about this."
"Of course." Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously, "I am a destiny mage."
"Pfft..." Not far away, a young man who was drinking water suddenly choked and coughed violently. The surrounding eyes looked at Ye Futian like an idiot.
There is such a shameless person in the world, he is worthy of being a legendary figure in Qingzhou Academy, who not only blatantly molested Senior Sister Qin, but now also lied that he was a Destiny Sorcerer, in order to attract Senior Sister Qin's attention?
However, who is he? He has practiced in the palace for three years and has been lingering in the first stage of awakening Qi Gathering Realm. His body is obviously weak and his body refinement has not been completed. A person who calls himself a destiny mage? How shameless is this?
Qin Yi's chest rose and fell again, suddenly surging, and she looked at Ye Futian angrily: "Since you are a destiny mage, naturally there is a soul in the destiny palace, release your soul from the destiny palace and let me see."
"My soul is still sleeping, and I can't summon it out. I fell asleep in the lecture hall because of my soul." Ye Futian responded calmly.
"Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted, her beautiful eyes fixed on the young man in front of her, and said: "Three years ago, when you entered the palace at the age of twelve, I was a disciple of the outer sect, visiting your talent test , Your perception of aura is heavenly, shocked the school, and many teachers paid attention to it. However, in the past three years, you have not made any progress, and you have always stayed in the first stage of awakening. You are idle, lazy, and absent-minded in class. Have you practiced?"
"In the past three years, you have abstained from all the exams, whether it is the spring exam or the autumn exam, and you are directly ranked first in the bottom of the school. Ye Futian, do you have any sense of shame?"
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the whole schoolhouse became silent, and a needle could be heard. Everyone stared at Qin Yi's excited face. It seemed that this was the first time they had seen Senior Sister Qin like this.
Ye Futian also seemed to be stunned, those dark eyes stared at the delicate face flushed with anger in front of him.
"Has it been three years?" Ye Futian murmured in his heart. He didn't expect that three years had passed before he knew it, and the guys in the Palace of Fate hadn't changed at all, and he was a little surprised. I have been paying attention to him, since he stepped into the school palace and detected the talent of Tianpin perception.
The space was dead silent, Qin Yimei stared at the young man in front of him, his handsome face with clear lines, his clean and deep eyes shining like stars, at the age of fifteen, except for his thin body, he couldn't find any other faults, in another three or two years , must be a beautiful man.
"Is my tone too strong?" Seeing that the corners of Ye Futian's eyes seemed to be a little lonely, Qin Yi couldn't help thinking to himself, and his anger dissipated a little.
"There is still one month to go to the big autumn exam. If you still abstain or fail this time, it will be useless to intercede for you for the rest of your life. The Academy will not allow you to stay any longer. Do you understand? "Qin Yi continued, the eyes of the people in the school stared, it seemed that the school couldn't bear it with that guy.
If this is the case, I am afraid it will be recorded in the history of Qingzhou Academy. After all, it is extremely rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy.
"He's going, I'm going." At the end, an indifferent voice came, and many people looked at the young man sitting in the corner with complicated eyes, including envy, jealousy, admiration, and fear.
"The Academy has already decided that the rest of his life does not need to participate in next year's Spring Festival. He can choose the Battle Tower of the Academy, the Knights, and any one of the Magic Palace to practice. His future can no longer be implicated by you." Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed. The fate of him and Yu Sheng will eventually go in completely different directions.
The corners of Ye Futian's mouth drew a faint smile, a little cynical.
"Shut up..." Yu Sheng who was sitting in the back stood up, his eyes were shining brightly and stabbed at Qin Yi.
"Sit down." Ye Futian said calmly without turning his head, Yu Sheng's eyes froze, looking at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words were iron orders to him.
"I decided..." Ye Futian showed a slightly frivolous smile on his face, looked at Qin Yi and said, "I have officially participated in this year's autumn exam."
Behind, Yu Sheng's eyes flashed a bright light.
After three years, he finally, is he going to be serious?
Three years of practice in the Qingzhou Academy, everyone in the Academy only knows that he is extremely talented for the rest of his life, has a supernatural power of metal attribute perception, and is also extremely talented in martial arts, but he can practice both martial arts and martial arts. Lecturers are even higher.
However, who really understands the sleeping boy?
"Your body is weak, and you are still in the first stage of awakening Qi Gathering Realm. Even if you take the autumn exam, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed in his heart. Even if he stood up now, it might be too late.
"What if it passes?" Ye Futian seemed to have no self-knowledge at all, and there was strong confidence in his tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall." Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed a strange brilliance, looking at the beautiful figure and hot figure in front of him, his eyes couldn't help but look where he shouldn't look, and said weakly: "Can you do whatever you want?"
"This guy, what do you mean..." Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where are your eyes looking?" Seemingly noticing Ye Futian's eyes, many people had the urge to run away, and he dared to moles Senior Sister Qin?
Qin Yi naturally also noticed Ye Futian's eyes, and the sympathy he had just born disappeared in an instant, and his beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian viciously, gnashing his teeth: "You can do whatever you want!"
In the deep mountains and dense forests, thousands of monsters gather.
For the first time, all ethnic groups put aside their grievances and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes... all kinds of monsters are here. For a time, the whole forest was filled with the sounds of all kinds of monsters, big or small, soft or seductive. There are ten demon kings sitting on the top, these ten top powerhouses in the demon world, but at this time there is the same heavy expression on their brows.
"Dear monsters, you must be aware of what happened here recently." The tiger clan has always been strong, and the tiger king was the first to speak so that all the monsters were quiet, "We are both monsters. Under such a crisis, I think all races should put aside their stereotypes and join hands to solve the current problems together."
"What is the purpose?"
"Do you still need to guess about this?" Tiger King snorted coldly, "Except for those monks from the six factions and three sects, who would do such a thing. Haven't we been slaughtered by him so few monsters these years?"
"But we have always been very different from these sects of cultivating immortals. Why did they suddenly block my way out of the world?" Fox King looked puzzled.
"I didn't eat the sons of their three sects and six sects." Snake King also guessed, "There's no need for them to tear their faces like this?"
"That's right!" Leopard King also said indignantly, "I've been here for so many years, which monster has never eaten a mortal, how could the three sects and six sects suddenly attack? I don't think it's them."
"Yes, everyone knows that the evil spirit in our world will damage their cultivation base, so they never get close to the border forest, so why would they stay here specially?"
"But...except for the six sects and three sects, who has the strength to kill all the monster clans that go out of the bounds within three months." The Tiger King still insisted on his own ideas.
The Eagle King nodded, as if recalling something, the feathers on his body trembled, "I heard that those monsters who went out of the world all died without bones, and there were also those who were skinned and cooked, and those in the forest On the old shame tree, there are dried corpses. The attack is so cruel...it is not as good as a beast."
"It's too much to bully demons." The tiger king smashed the armrest of the stone chair with his palm, and stood up angrily, "Dear demon kings, I think it's better to go out together and find out who did it than guess who did it here. I understand. I don't believe it, no matter how high their cultivation base is, can they still stop this army of ten thousand monsters?"
As soon as he uttered these words, the other nine demon kings immediately showed expressions of approval. It is indeed better to take the initiative to attack than to be frightened.
Deer King was the first to respond, "My son died at their hands. Instead of guessing here and there, it's better to go out and kill him. So what about the three sects and six sects, when have we monsters been afraid of them!"
"Isn't that why we gathered here today? Whoever he is, go out and avenge the dead of his kind." Even the most timid rabbit king stood up and responded, and the rabbit clan died the most.
"That's right, if you don't avenge this revenge, you'll be a demon in vain!"
"The demon souls of the clansmen are above me, and I swear to avenge this."
The other demon kings also stood up to respond one after another, and even the monsters of all races and monsters who were on standby all around showed up one after another. Bright Claw's Bright Claw excitedly shouted the slogan of revenge, and Yan Ran looked like an army ready to go.
"Then what..." A thin voice suddenly sounded from among the monsters, "I don't think there is any need to go."
In the wave of anger, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared. Although the voice was not loud, it successfully attracted the attention of all the monsters. As soon as the shouting stopped, the sights of all the monsters pierced towards him.
"Who is it?" The Tiger King roared even more, searching for this unspecified monster.
All the demons looked around, they were obviously the monsters with the most sensitive five senses, but after searching for a long time, they couldn't find the person who made the sound.
"Who was the one who just spoke?" The Tiger King was a little annoyed, "Where is the cowardly monster? If you have the guts, stand up for me!"
"I'm here, here!"
The demons inspected the surroundings several times again, but they still didn't see who the voice was.
"Here, here..." the voice said again, "Left to the left, no...it's over, a bit to the right, wrong, look here, look here!"
The demons followed the voice and looked left and right several times, but they still couldn't find the person who made the sound.
"Oh! Forget it, I'm here!"
Until he sighed, a figure suddenly climbed onto the high platform where all the demon kings were sitting, using both hands and feet. Only then did the demons see the person who made the sound.
It was a woman in a gray robe, her shoulders were weak, her eyes were vacillating and falling down, her whole body exuded a lazy temperament, she was short and thin, and her face was still pale. A little sallow.
A word "weak" appeared in the minds of all the demons at the same time, too weak! Even the demonic aura on her body was pitifully weak, as if any demon breath could blow her away.
It's no wonder that all the monsters searched for a long time just now and didn't find this person. Such a monster is really inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King immediately couldn't stand it anymore, sniffed his tiger's nose, and said fiercely, "Hmph, you bastard, a few monks frightened you, and you turned into this." All of them can take shape, but this is the Ten Thousand Monsters Conference, so most of the monster races here have revealed some prototypes to distinguish races, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes Tiger King even more displeased, "I dare not What kind of demon are you to show your true form?" "I'm a human."
"I am human." The woman replied.
"Shemale?" Tiger King was stunned for a moment, "What kind of monster is a shemale? I've never heard of it!"
"Why do some weak little monsters dare to come to the Ten Thousand Monsters Conference." The Tiger King glared at the woman indignantly, "You useless little monster, don't talk nonsense here and affect us to go to revenge morale."
"No, I'm serious." The woman raised her hand without remorse, but her shoulders drooped unconsciously, making her look weaker, "There's really no need for you to go out and seek revenge."
"Still talking frustrating words!" The Tiger King got angry and roared, "Believe it or not, I ate you, little demon."
"You ate me, so there's no need to make a trip in vain?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, the guy you just mentioned who kills all monsters and is inferior to beasts..." She sighed, patted the dusty robe and raised her head, still looking listless, but pointed Pointing to his nose, "Maybe...it's me!"
The audience was silent for three seconds, completely silent.
"Kill her!"
Wan Yao, who came to his senses, rushed towards the woman at the same time.
Small animals or something - so troublesome!
Five minutes later.
——The first and last Ten Thousand Monsters Conference has come to an end!
Chapter 1 Tony Twain?
The huge noise stimulates the brain nerves, and the decibels can cause deafness. A glaring white light shot into the eyes, and the sun was bulging and painful.
Tang En couldn't help squinting his eyes, but the white light didn't disappear, instead it spread to the whole world.
What the hell is going on? Am I at a rock concert?
Tang En cursed in his heart and opened his eyes, but what rushed into his eyes was a big scary face. A black face covered with sweat, the heat from the two black holes under the wide nose seems to have touched his face. The white teeth in the gaping mouth are as frightening as wild animals, and of course there is bad breath coming out of it.
What followed was a fierce, head-on collision. Tang En felt as if he had been hit on the jaw by a heavy punch, and he fell backwards.
The weight of two people was on those poor plastic bottles, and they collapsed under the weight. White water splashed out, and even a jet of water shot out from the mouth of a certain bottle, soaring directly to the face of the "chi fish" behind, and the other "chi fish" soared into the sky like frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!"
"What the hell!"
"How is this going?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick it?"
Tang En lay on the ground, staring blankly at the strange faces around him. Some of them looked anxious, some gloated, and some covered their faces so that they couldn't see their expressions. The surroundings were still very noisy, but the huge uproar just now had changed its tone, and there were hisses and laughter in it.
This is where? who are they? How is this going?
Wait, let's see what happened on the sidelines? The commentator of the live broadcast suddenly became excited. He stood up and looked down from the top stand, "David Johnson, the main striker of the Forest team, was knocked into the field during the fight with the opposing player. On the side bench, poor coach Tony Twain happened to be standing on the sidelines directing the game... Oh! Look at the tragedy on the ground, this is really a collision of sparks hitting the earth!
Tang En was lying on the ground, his light gray suit was soaked, crumpled and stained with grass clippings and dirt, it looked like a freshly used rag.
A man with a big nose and black beard who looked like Super Mario appeared in his field of vision. He quickly took out white gloves from the colored leather bag he carried with him and put them on, then began to examine Tang En's body.
Hell, it looks like he landed on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me?" He stretched out his hand and waved it in front of Tang En's eyes, his tone obviously much more anxious than before.
At the same time, the scene just now began to be played repeatedly on the TV screen.
David Johnson was pushed hard by the opponent in a fierce fight with the opponent's No. 14, and then the big black man slanted his body and rushed towards Tony Twain who was standing on the sidelines. But what was strange was that Twain could have avoided it in the first place. He had plenty of time, but now he stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his team members crash into him.
scene. The players of the Forest team anxiously gathered around the coach's bench. Naturally, Twain was lying on the ground in the center of the crowd. David Johnson, the black striker who made a mistake, knelt on the ground and kept praying. If there is something wrong with his coach, he will become the first player to kill his coach on the court.
Different from the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood on the field, watching the show with their arms folded. There were also curious people who took on the responsibility of being the team's spies, kept running to watch the excitement, and then ran back to catch the crowd. Share the situation with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem worried about their manager's life or death. They took the opportunity to curse their team's poor performance loudly, and all kinds of words starting with "F" or "s" burst out of their mouths. Countless raised middle fingers set off the "0:2" on the big screen particularly dazzlingly.
Forest team doctor Gary Fleming is still doing his best. He clearly saw Tony's eyeballs move a moment ago, why didn't he respond then?
He patted Tony Twain's face, but there was still no response. The team's acting head coach was lying on the ground like a wax figure, with his mouth slightly open and his eyes wide open, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue sky, the white clouds like cotton candy, the faces with different skin colors and expressions, and the noisy environment, all of these are very familiar, yet so strange, as if they are thousands of miles away from me.
The referee signaled the team doctor to watch and deal with it. He cannot stop the game endlessly because of off-court injuries. He blew the whistle to let the players return to the field, and the game will continue, although the Forest players have no desire to fight.
"But his life may even be in danger!" Fleming was very angry at the referee's indifference. He pointed at Twain who was still lying on the ground and shouted at the referee.
"Then you call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!" The referee pushed back without showing any weakness, "Besides, he doesn't seem as dangerous as you said." He pointed behind Fleming and ran back to the court.
Fleming turned back and saw Tang En standing up slowly while touching the back of his head, he hurried up to support him. "How are you feeling, Tony?"
Tang En asked blankly: "Where is this?"
Fleming turned around and cursed, what a bad time these days. "Des, Des, come here!" He beckoned a golden man on the coach's bench to come over.
A man called "Des" ran over. "How's Tony?"
"It sucks. He even asked me where this is?"
Des's reaction was exactly the same as Fleming's just now, and he also turned around and cursed.
"I suspect this is the result of the impact on the back of his head when he fell to the ground just now."
"Is it bad, Gary?" Des bit his lip, his face serious.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad." Fleming shook his head.
"what does that mean?"
"In a good case, he just lost his memory for a short time, and he will recover after a short rest. In a bad case...do you need me to tell you?"
Des waved his hand, indicating that he understood. "Send him to the hospital? But the game is still going on now, and we are behind, we need him to direct the game..." As he spoke, he turned his head and glanced at Tony Twain next to him, but he was surprised to find that Twain was alone Slowly move towards the player tunnel.
"Hey!" Des quickly dropped Fleming and ran forward to grab his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going?" In the noisy environment, Des's yelling with claws and claws actually only had the effect of "whispering".
Tang En turned his head and looked at Des blankly. This look made Des feel chills. Now the afterglow of the sunset above their heads was shining golden, but he could not see any brilliance in those eyes at all.
"Tony, where are you going?" Des repeated.
"I...I don't know, maybe...going home..." Tang En murmured, still trying to break free from Des's hand.
Fleming also ran over from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now. We are playing, you are the head coach, you have to command the team!"
The pulling of the three people at the entrance of the passage attracted the attention of the benches of the two teams and the stands, and even the players on the field would glance here from time to time.
Tang En suddenly smiled: "I'm a coach?" This is ridiculous, how could I be a coach... Although I am a fan and often play football manager games, how could I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a damned nightmare!
Fleming said from the side as if introducing the two people who met for the first time: "He is Des, Des Walker (desa1ker). The former England international, who was in charge of the central defender on the field, only retired from the team last season. Now he is your colleague, your assistant."
Tang En nodded, and then said to Des: "Okay, now you direct the game for me, I'm going to rest." After speaking, he broke away from Des's hand, and no longer cared about the huge boos behind him and the two The stunned person walked into the passage.
Fleming looked at Tang En's back, then at Des Walker.
Walker sighed heavily, turned and walked back. "This game can't be played!"
Tang En sat in the passage with his back against the wall, looking at the surrounding environment blankly. On the white wall opposite him is a huge sign. Below the big red "mushroom" are three wavy curves, and below that is an English word: Forest.
Where am I? What is going on?
Tang En touched the back of his head, there was still a dull pain there.
***, sneak attack on me, hit me behind!
"What's my name?" He muttered to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth. It wasn't until this time that he realized that what he had been speaking was bird language—English.
"***, how did this happen?"
Tang En, who finally realized where he was, was stunned again. This was so unbelievable that his brain stopped responding after the load calculation. And all this seems to have nothing to do with him.
The above is the scene that happened at the city stadium this afternoon. The forest team's acting head coach Tony Twain was knocked down by his players while standing on the sidelines, and then seemed to have fallen into a brief coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the player tunnel.
With the faint light of the street lamp outside, Tang En stood in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged ghost with a tall and straight nose, deep eye sockets, blue eyes, and brown curly head.
In fact, Tang En from Sichuan, China is only 26 years old, and the person in the mirror even has forehead lines! Thirty-four years old! This is Tony Twain's age.
Not only did he bend over an Englishman inexplicably, but he also traveled forward for four years and three months!
Although he never thought that he was handsome and could attract many women's favor.
He growled at the mirror and shattered it with one punch. The self in the mirror suddenly became countless, and the fragments fell to the ground with a splashing sound. Countless faces looked at Tang En as if they were laughing at him.
Tang En felt a little dizzy, he took a step back, leaned against the smooth wall and panted heavily.
Tang En, who stayed quietly in the dark for a few minutes, gradually calmed down, and he decided not to think about such a complicated issue. He has a habit in China, whenever something goes wrong, he will find a place to drink. There are bars everywhere in Chengdu, maybe you can find a one-night stand by the way. He habitually regarded Nottingham as Chengdu in his heart, and decided to go out and find a bar to drink away his worries.
Glancing at the hazy sky outside, he put on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
"At home, they lost 0:3 to the underdog Walsall. The Forest team has been really unlucky recently. Paul Hart, who had high hopes, did not bring good results to the team. Team president Nigel Doughty submitted his resignation and it was quickly approved."
Today's sports news is being broadcast on the TV fixed on the overhead, and the focus is naturally on everything that happened on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There was booing in the noisy bar.
A big drunk man raised his middle finger at the TV. "That Tony Twain, I know him! The kid who used to be Paul Hart's assistant in the youth team."
When the drunk had just finished his long speech, Tang En just pushed the door open and entered. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the people who were drinking and chatting in the bar. Everyone turned their attention to the door. When they saw who came in, they were surprised at first, and then there were joking smiles on their faces.
A typical British middle-aged man stood up holding a glass of wine, and shouted loudly, "Our Coach Tony Twain is here!"
"Woohoo!" The people in the bar hissed "Welcome".
"Here's a toast to his beautiful defense of Johnson's breakthrough from the sidelines!" The middle-aged man raised the wine glass in his hand, and the people around immediately raised their wine glasses in agreement. "cheers!
Another man who was clearly drunk stood up crookedly, walked up to Tang En, held a beer bottle in his hand and put it to his mouth, hiccupped and asked, "Coach Tony Dunn, was that one time of beautiful defense, but the referee and public opinion obviously don't...don't think so...uh!
After asking, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So he sullenly pushed away the wine bottle in front of him. Then he went straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside: "Please bring a bottle..." He habitually wanted to say a bottle of "Xiao Er" - a small bottle of Erguotou. Although he is from Sichuan, he went to university in the north , From then on, he fell in love with this kind of strong alcohol - but he found that he could not speak English of "Xiaoer", and more importantly, he quickly realized that this was in the UK, not in China. He bowed his head and muttered a curse, then changed his words: "Bring the strongest wine."
The other people who had been watching him all the time heard him say that he wanted the strongest wine, and they booed loudly.
"Yo! Cowardly Tony even drinks?"
The young bartender was also at a loss in the face of these excited guests. He wanted to get the wine but was stopped by the alcoholics: "Get him juice! Juice!"
"No no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ah ha ha!"
The owner of this bar was alarmed by the noise outside. He came down from the stairs and stood at the stairs. He saw almost all the guests who hadn't fallen asleep on the table gathered around the bar. The man wrapped in a black windbreaker was laughed at heartily by those drunkards.
His loud voice immediately silenced the tavern. The drunkards who were still arrogant just now fell silent when they saw the person standing behind them.
Tang En felt strange, who could make this group of people calm down with just one sentence? He turned his head slightly and saw a person coming out of the shadow of the stairs.
The young bartender quickly pointed to Tang En and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a strong drink."
After seeing clearly who the person sitting was, the visitor was a little surprised, but he still said, "Give it to him."
"But...but they won't let..." The bartender looked at the drunkards who had returned to their seats in embarrassment.
The man looked around the bar, but everyone he caught his gaze lowered their heads, either pretending to be asleep, or drinking with their heads down. Tang En became more and more interested in this capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see that no one has any objections. Pour him a glass of Scotch whiskey and I'll treat him." The bar owner turned around and asked Dunn, "Single or double?"
The drunkards who watched the excitement next to him burst out laughing.
The barkeeper laughed too. "I forgot who you are..." He poured half a glass of golden whiskey into the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then handed it to Tang En: "This is the wine from my hometown."
Tang En took a sip and immediately coughed. He rarely drank foreign wine. What's more, this pure Scotch whiskey still has a strong smell of coke.
There was a burst of gloating laughter in the bar.
"The Tony Twain I know never drinks, and lives like a true traditional Puritan. And he won't look at me like this now, don't you know who I am?" The man stared at Tang En, and Tang En found that he seemed to be seen through by this man.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Uh...I", Tang En lowered his head and took another sip. This time he didn't dare to let the wine stay in his throat for a second longer, and swallowed it directly. The uncomfortable feeling was indeed a little lighter.
There was another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head to express his understanding.
Someone nearby helped Tang En out, and a voice yelled: "It seems that our coach Tony really got his head smashed! The person sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, the hero of the two European Champions Cups." , Mr. Kenny Burns, winner of the Stanley Matthews Award in 1978! He's a hundred times better than your ass!"
The people behind laughed loudly, "Stupid Donkey Stupid Donkey" kept yelling, but unexpectedly the person he laughed at snapped back and poured out the half glass of wine left in his hand. The golden Scotch whiskey shone brilliantly under the light, drawing a beautiful arc in the air, and then shot it precisely on the face of the unlucky guy—precise and beautiful like David Beckham's right foot Free kick. "boom!"
His swear words were thrown back by a thick wine glass, and Tang En threw himself on the opponent with the speed that no one else could have imagined. He couldn't take it anymore, came to this place somehow, traveled forward for four and a half years for no reason, was ridiculed and insulted for no reason... He just wants to find someone to vent to, no matter if he beats someone down, or Others beat him.
The two slammed into the table behind, and the empty wine bottle fell and shattered on the ground with a crisp sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect that Tony Twain, who was still a coward just now, would suddenly explode.
The first person to react was the bar owner Kenny Burns. He pushed the fat man standing by the bar and shouted: "What are you doing standing there? Pull them away!"
In addition to the tragic situation on the ground, the forehead of the person who was beaten was already oozing blood, and a red circle appeared there, which was the mark of the mouth of the cup. In addition, his left cheek was punched, and it was as red as drunk.
As for Tang En, apart from messing up his hair and clothes, nothing happened. Being pulled up, he seemed to have vented his anger, and he didn't want to rush to chase him. He straightened his clothes and head, and then spat at the unlucky ghost who was being held up by his companion: "I don't care who you are , don't mess with me."
Then he turned to Burns and said, "Sorry for messing up your place. Today is too fucking..." He was annoyed at the thought of being transmigrated, "Another day... I will come and apologize in person, and make up Please don't worry either."
Then, without waiting for the owner of the bar to say anything, he turned and walked towards the door. When he passed the fat man, he sarcastically said, "Let's keep your milk for yourself, fat pig."
Everyone watched him push the door out, but no one thought to stop him. They just watched him leave, leaving a mess.
There was silence in the bar. At this time, the drunken man sat up from the table, looked at the silent room and the mess, and asked in confusion, "Did I miss something?"
I don't want to be a ghost! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Tang En shout like that?
Since my "previous life" was quite bad, why not take this opportunity to live a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, he has also watched football for more than ten years. He has played every generation of football manager games, and he understands the nature of some coaches' work. Isn't this a good opportunity for a challenge?
He stopped thinking about the boring question of why God chose him. He just needs to think about how to act more like a real professional coach now. Although it will be difficult, it will be worth trying.
"Hey, buddy. You broke into my house without my permission. I'll call the police if you don't leave!" An old voice suddenly sounded from the side.
Tang En blankly looked at the old man standing across from him. He was holding a lot of newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten hamburger in his hand.
"This... is your home?" He pointed to the bench under his bed.
"certainly."
"Ah, I'm sorry to bother you..." Tang En stood up from the chair, and the other party sat down immediately, and then lay down. Cover yourself with newspapers in your arms, and press them firmly between the back of the chair and your body.
Seeing the contented beggar eating hamburgers and lying in the "newspaper nest", Tang En even thanked God for not allowing himself to "possess" him. Fate has not treated him badly.
A taxi dropped off ahead of him, and he stepped forward quickly, then slipped in. In the car, Tang En took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying his "dinner", and asked the driver to take him back to that strange home.
Starting today, a brand new world is slowly unfolding before Tang En's eyes. On a sunny Saturday morning, Zhao Yao was on his way to neutering...on his way to neutering his cat.
In the cat bag in his hand is a yellow raccoon cat, also called an orange cat, a kind of garden cat. The head, back, and limbs are covered with layers of yellow-orange markings.
There is a large fluffy white hair on the chest and stomach, and the tips of the limbs are white. It is said that this kind of snow-walking white gloves has an instant killing effect on girls, and will control their brain waves, making them say "ah~~ah~~" sound.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and looks very girlish.
At this moment, the cat was howling heart-piercingly. The vast majority of domestic cats are very, very housebound, and they only want to stay at home all their lives. Moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao could only comfort the cat by making noises.
At the same time, outside the earth's atmosphere, a dim meteor slowly crossed the outer space and gradually flew over China. The surface of the meteor shone with a strange luster, and it seemed to be continuously releasing towards the surrounding void. Some kind of ray.
In the Xingxing Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag at the front desk: "The male cat is neutered. I made an appointment before. The surname is Zhao."
"You have never been to us before looking at the records, and you need to fill in the information column of the medical record card."
In the outer space, the meteor slowly passed over the sky of China, and began to head towards the Pacific Ocean. Where the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies, and their eyes flashed with a deep luster, just like the same luster as a shooting star.
At this moment, Matcha suddenly moved, struggled to jump up, and rushed towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse let out a scream, but Zhao Yao who was at the side rushed out suddenly, grabbing the escaped Matcha.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow, he couldn't catch Matcha's body, but only caught Matcha's tail.
When the tail was caught, Matcha let out a roar, and instinctively turned around and bit Zhao Yao. This is the instinct of cats, and the speed is extremely fast. In an instant, a gash was opened on the back of Zhao Yao's hand. Zhao Yao Yao felt pain in the back of his hand, and immediately let go of his palm.
Maybe it was because she knew that she had caused trouble, but Matcha didn't continue to run away. She just curled up and looked at Zhao Yao uneasily.
Zhao Yao hugged Matcha and said, "Silly cat, why are you biting? You're rebelling, right?"
A glint of light suddenly flashed across the eyes of the matcha cat, and the traces of blood stained on the teeth disappeared completely.
Zhao Yao also felt dizzy all of a sudden, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but he was slightly stunned when he saw it, and he saw that the back of his hand was clean, there was no wound or blood.
The little nurse at the side took the cat and comforted her: "Be good at Matcha, it's fine, it will be fine in a while, don't be nervous."
In Zhao Yao's ears, the cry was not a mere meow, but an understandable discourse.
Zhao Yao pointed at the matcha in front of him in shock, and said with a look of surprise: "This... this... this cat has spoken!"
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you okay?"
"Didn't you hear it?" Zhao Yao said hastily, "It...it's talking."
The little nurse frowned, and looked at Zhao Yao more and more strangely.
"Can you understand me, meow?"
"Take me home!"
"Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..."
Zhao Yao suddenly opened his mouth wide, looked at the little nurse who was still comforting Matcha, looked at Matcha and said, "Can you understand me?"
"I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, take me home, woo woo woo woo woo woo."
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao who was talking to the cat, but her expression became more and more weird.
Ignoring the little nurse's strange gaze, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into his bag, then trotted away from the hospital.
In the rental house, the matcha cat immediately relaxed after returning to the familiar environment, lying on the tea table and began to lick his little white hands, his eyes narrowed, and his expression was leisurely. For cats, licking has always been a very relaxing behavior.
Before the tea table, Zhao Yao stared at the matcha cat in front of him, and asked tentatively, "Can you still talk?"
After speaking, he stood up and asked eagerly, "Master, do you want to play games?"
"Hey, this...we'll play again later." Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said a little at a loss, "When did you learn to speak?"
Looking at the innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao had a strange expression on his face.
The matcha cat didn't feel weird about the situation in front of it at all. It suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted its eyes and rubbed against Zhao Yao's body, and said softly, "Play a game with me."
Seeing the matcha cat talking like a five-year-old child in front of him, Zhao Yao touched the other's head, and the latter purred in enjoyment.
"According to the calculation, you are only one year old, and you are only five years old now." Zhao Yao smiled slightly: "You are still a child, so it seems not bad."
A month later, at nine o'clock in the evening.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes, and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rented house he lives in is only 30 square meters, it is fully furnished and furnished. It is a house used by a newlywed couple, and it is very close to the company, allowing him to work overtime every day without worrying about traffic problems, so although the rent is not cheap, But still let Zhao Yao out willingly.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat crawled to his side unknowingly, and rubbed its head against his arm with an affectionate and obsequious look.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed Matcha's head, the latter showed an expression of enjoyment.
But at this moment, the mobile phone on the sofa was pushed over by Matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, with her slender white arms resting on her little head, her long black hair like silk hanging down in the air, revealing half of her bright little face, um, hot, so hot.
what happened?
There was a steady stream of heat in her body that burned her little face, making her feel uncomfortable. Today she came to the imperial capital from Yecheng, and just drank a glass of boiled water handed by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
"It's no good, Tang Mo'er jumped down, go after her, don't let her run away!"
Tang Mo'er shuddered and was more than half awake. Han Xiaowan actually set her up!
what to do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man, as if she had caught a life-saving straw, "Sir, help me, I've been drugged, and there are a few men behind me who want to rape me."
The man's deep and cold narrow eyes passed the girl and glanced at the men behind him. Although his gaze was light, it made people shudder.
Those men are punks, and they have seen some of the world. They have seen this man who covers the headlines of the entire financial magazine and controls the economic lifeline of the entire imperial capital. They have seen it on TV.
Gu Mohan.
They absolutely can't afford to mess with this man, so they turned around and ran away. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle is taking place. Angels with flaming wings, knights in heavy armor, and crusaders holding golden long swords are fighting with a group of black-clad warriors. The evil army composed of smokey bone dragons, ferocious and terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers fought fiercely.
The battle field between the two sides is not somewhere on a plain full of war and smoke or a burial ground full of bones, but in a pitch-black darkness with no bounds. This is undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what is even more weird is that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, a few indistinct voices can be heard whispering?
"Operate it, operate it quickly! My God!"
"When talking about others, you should first control your death knight! The death knight is fighting with the mobile bunker!!"
"Where is my army? Who is attacking my army? Where is the enemy?"
After the battle, the angels, knights, and fleeing skeleton soldiers that existed on the battlefield also disappeared into the darkness of the background, and the place has once again returned to the state of absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness. Never happened.
But several voices continued to communicate, and even more other voices joined in.
"My teammates are simply a bunch of pigs! Dogs on the leash are better than them! Not only will they not help the situation in the slightest, but they will also grab the command of the core troops..." said the voice that failed before.
"Bah! It's clearly because the undead creatures are too weak. If it is replaced by my demon army, it will definitely be different..." Another voice also counterattacked without showing weakness, and made such a speech for his wrong command. Forcibly defended: "I originally thought that the death knight could easily get rid of those bunkers."
After hearing this voice, a few chuckles could not help coming from the darkness, and the two sides in the argument lost their temper immediately, and said helplessly to the winning side: "The skills are not as good as others, and they are willing to bow down."
And the winner actually carried out a round of ridicule without grace at this time?
"Haha! Justice will eventually triumph over evil!"
"In the face of our strength, whether it is undead or demons, even gods will be killed for you!"
Such words undoubtedly made people even more angry. The two sides who had already calmed down suddenly started a new round of scolding, and the third person on the winning side who was wandering outside this new battlefield asked helplessly: "Should I not organize this round?"
It turned out that the tragic and heroic battle before was just a game?
A voice who didn't participate in the game responded: "It's really amazing that you can simulate a realistic war with your consciousness, and let us bystanders feel as if you are in the scene. You are really good at surprising us, Hope sir."
And this guy called Hope, facing the sudden thanks from the other party, replied in a low-key manner: "You are too much, this is just a pastime."
Yes, that battle, which was like a life-and-death confrontation between the camps of justice and evil, was just a pastime, and it could only add a little bit of fun to this endless prison.
This is the realm of the void beyond the real plane. It is supposed to be an eternally dark, cold, and silent Jedi. No living beings will survive. It is a realm more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, this dead place that can hardly accommodate any living beings, there is a group of hard-to-determined creatures stubbornly living. They have lost their bodies, and only their last consciousness remains in this void.
They call themselves Voidwalkers, and they are imprisoned forever in this prison named Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were all extremely strong men of various races and fields, mages who reached the apex of the magic way, warriors who touched the limit of martial arts, alchemists who created everything, missionaries who were loyal and noble, demons who ruled hell, controlled The lich of the soul, etc., they have left their names in the history of various planes.
Many people think that they have long since disappeared, only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they don't know that this group of old monsters who are strong enough to be described as perverted are actually imprisoned in the endless void outside the plane , has spent countless years there, and seems to be imprisoned here forever. The seemingly thin barrier between the real plane and the void is a wall of sighs that they can never break through. The power they once possessed was so powerful, but there was nothing they could do about it.
But they never gave up the hope of getting out of trouble, because there is an extremely special existence among the 33 void walkers, that is, the fifth walker code-named Hope.
Hope's original name is Bai Yi, not from the large and small planes where human beings live outside the void, but from a strange place called Earth. He was an editor of a small news website before his death, and his daily job was to read from other websites at home and abroad. Excerpt the news on the Internet, and then put on a news such as Blast!
Men will cry, women will be silent and other titles are published on their own websites, which is a noisy and boring job.
Later, Bai Yi, who died due to an accident, did not lose his consciousness immediately. Instead, he entered this mysterious void by accident, met several other void walkers, and survived like this in the end. , until this moment.
The voidwalkers insisted that he from a different world would be the key to escape this endless prison, "Only you are different, you are our only chance to get out of here. I firmly believe in this, so I use I hope you will be called by this code name." The first traveler in the void, the one code-named Magician, once said to him like this.
They have always believed in this, that they will see the light of day again, even though they have been imprisoned for countless times, hundreds of years? For thousands of years?
If you want to persist in this eternal prison for thousands of years without going crazy, it is obviously not enough to just chat or discuss. In fact, the most important way for void walkers to pass the time is an item called memory. shared activity.
This activity is based on a consciousness technique called memory recall. After using memory recall, people can recall every detail they have experienced, even every punctuation in the newspaper can be clearly recalled.
Then through a certain degree of editing, remove some memories that you don’t want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your left and right hands, and then exchange the memory with the other party, which is equivalent to enjoying a super movie about other people’s life. Long movies, which are a great way to pass the time.
The memory of the thirty-three void walkers is equivalent to allowing him to experience thirty-three lives. Even though he later forgot most of the memories in order to avoid memory confusion, and only kept their knowledge and experience, his state of mind Also in these 33 life experiences, all kinds of weaknesses such as childishness and impetuousness have been screened out, and he has become mature and stable, and he is no longer an ordinary person on earth.
That's why he was placed with high hopes by other void walkers. However, countless years have passed, and even he couldn't find any opportunity to leave. The only thing he did was to make this boring time a little less so. It's just boring.
At the same time, the real plane East is about to usher in nightfall. When the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire Xiansai College, the students finally finished their heavy schoolwork for the day. Vigorous laughter and walking in twos and threes on the tree-lined paths in the college.
Miya, a second-year student from the Soul Armor department, is also one of them. She has a cute face, long black hair combed into two equally lovely twin ponytails, and wears the standard uniform of Xiansai Academy. After a simple farewell, they came to the square of the college alone, found a bench at random and sat down, then took out some leftover half of bread from dinner from their coat pockets, and carefully tore the bread into a little bit of debris, and then thinly sprinkled on the bluestone floor of the square.
A moment later, there was a sound of flapping wings in the air, and several white pigeons quickly landed at Miya's feet, and while they lowered their heads to eat the bread crumbs she sprinkled, they made a cooing sound. Ya squatted down cautiously, and her long twin tails swept the ground gently with her movements. She quietly looked at the group of pigeons she was already familiar with, with a gratified smile on her face.
The beautiful girl, the docile white dove, and the square with several statues standing quietly, together with the surrounding lush vegetation, under the last golden light of the setting sun, together form a beautiful picture.
This is what Miya does every day, and it is also the most relaxing moment of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life in Xiansai College, an institution of higher learning, will always seem extraordinarily hard.
"It's getting dark, let's stop here today, I have to go back to practice, goodbye, Mr. Pigeons." With a relaxed smile on her face, Miya bid farewell to the group of pigeons, and walked away With slender legs wrapped in white stockings under the short uniform skirt, she hurried back to her dormitory.
Evening is also a very important time for studying, especially for a student with average talent like Miya, the effort required is not as easy as the smile she seems to always hang on her face.
1. Chapter 1
In the Su family's mansion, in the huge martial arts arena, a martial arts awakening ceremony is being held.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, is the son of the great elder of the Su family, with exceptional talent.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the Patriarch of the Su family, completed the nine-level body tempering at the age of 14, and is known as the number one genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, with Su Mo's talent, the awakened Martial Soul will certainly be no worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo can also awaken a Martial Soul above the fifth human level, then the Su family will have two top geniuses this time, and the future development of their Su family will be no small matter.
When the presiding elder called out this name, the shocked disciples, elders, and others all looked at the handsome young man next to him. The anticipation in their eyes was extremely strong, even surpassing the previous one. Su Yu.
With a calm face, Su Mo walked up to the altar.
Su Yu, who walked down the altar, smiled proudly at Su Mo, his eyes full of provocation.
Su Mo ignored him, took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes.
From the bottom of the altar, streaks of talisman lights immediately floated out, continuously penetrating into Su Mo's body.
His talent is top notch in the Su family, and he completed body tempering at the age of fifteen, so his talent is not bad. However, he was always overwhelmed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more runes flashed on the altar, covering Su Mo's body.
Su Mo, who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, breathed slightly rapidly, and bursts of roaring sounds gradually sounded from his body.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared fixedly at the altar!
boom!
Finally, with a bang, a pitch-black phantom suddenly rose up. The pitch-black phantom was like a black hole, slowly rotating inside, and the depth was bottomless, giving people a sense of coldness.
At the same time, a yellow halo flashed above the phantom.
ah!
In an instant, the eyes of everyone in the audience froze.
A halo?
The most low-level martial spirit?
How can this be?
Even Su Yu was stunned and stunned.
Because, he never thought that the first genius of the Su family could only awaken a first-order human-level martial soul, the lowest-level martial soul!
Su Mo sat cross-legged on the altar, slowly opened his eyes, and was stunned when he saw his martial spirit.
"A human-level first-level martial spirit...!" Su Mo muttered to himself, with a wry smile on his lips. He never thought that he would awaken a lowest-level martial spirit!
The dirtiest martial spirit? ""A waste martial spirit has been awakened!"
"What kind of first genius is it, the first waste of my Su family."
All of a sudden, including the elders of the Su family, the deacon, and others, everyone looked at Su Mo with disappointment, disdain, and contempt.
On the altar, Su Mo stood up slowly and clenched his fists unconsciously.
After glancing around coldly, Su Mo sneered in his heart, "These people are really snobbish!"
In the past, Su Mo was extremely talented, and everyone was very polite to him. Everywhere he went, he was hugged and flattered.
Now that he had awakened the trash martial soul, these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head, didn't bother with them, walked down the altar and strode away.
His face was itchy, and there seemed to be a patch of grass around him.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I come back to life?"
He was a little surprised, but before he had time to figure out how he narrowly escaped death, the scene in front of him immediately made his eyes widen with excitement. Immediately bewildered!
Can't! How can such a beautiful girl be so convenient everywhere?
Xu Que's eyes widened. Just like this, I watched the beautiful girl completely take off the skirt in front of my eyes, and the obscene pants inside were also taken off little by little. The eyes were tender and white, and there was a woman's body. Unique body fragrance.
"Girl, what are you doing, you can't defecate anywhere!"
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, lowered the hem of her skirt in a panic, bounced up from the spot, and flew across the air while stepping on a sharp sword.
Damn, what is this? Yujian Flying to the Sky?
So, is she really a fairy?
Xu Que was startled, at the same time, a large section of strange but familiar memories suddenly appeared in his head, as if he had been born with it.
I fucking time-traveled!
Immediately reading the memories in his mind that did not belong to him, Xu Que sorted out everything.
This place turned out to be a world of cultivating immortals, just like the little fairy in front of me who was so angry that she flew into the sky with her sword flying. People can practice various skills to become immortals.
And the owner of my own body is actually the current son-in-law, but this son-in-law is completely unlucky.
He himself is just a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was chosen by the emperor to be his son-in-law by chance, and he was provided with countless natural materials and treasures for his cultivation. In just six years, he condensed the belly pill and entered the golden pill stage.
The day when he stepped into the golden core stage, he really entered the bridal chamber with the princess, and spent seven consecutive days and nights on the marriage bed. As a result, the coquettishly beautiful princess was so charming that he repaired his entire body. All of a sudden, even the spiritual root talent was taken away.
The genius son-in-law was reduced to a useless person just after he got married. He was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner, and was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner. On the way to the border, he was slapped to death by someone arranged by the emperor. this.
"Oh, what a pity!"
After sorting out these memories, Xu Que was full of regret, shook his head and sighed, annoyed: "Damn it! Why didn't we go a step earlier and travel to the happy time when we were doing exercises on the bed with the beautiful princess?"
Thinking of the ecstatic charm of that glamorous princess on the wedding bed, her proud figure, and her coquettish panting, Xu Que felt more and more regretful that she was a step late!
"The daring pervert, dare to spy on this girl going to the toilet, and kill me!"
At this time, a coquettish reprimand suddenly came, and it was the fairy who had gone and returned.
She was flushed with embarrassment and anger, but there was endless killing intent in her eyes, she was still stepping on the cold sharp sword, and killed Xu Que.
"Damn, Fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It's obvious that you squatted on the place where I was lying, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please pull up your pants first, okay? You It looks like I have no motivation to run away!" Xu Que yelled and ran away.
The woman's complexion changed immediately, and she raised the obscene pants under the skirt with a red face, yelled, and angrily said: "The prostitute is looking for death." The flying speed of the sharp sword under her feet suddenly accelerated, swishing towards Xu Que to kill.
While running wildly, Xu Que frantically thought of ways to escape.
Suddenly, a flash of inspiration flashed in my mind.
Immediately, he stopped walking, reached out his hand and took out a familiar token from his bosom, turned around and shouted at the woman: "Bold demon girl, I am the consort of Huo Yuan Kingdom today, how dare you disrespect me? Be careful, I will kill you nine clans!" "
At this moment, a series of system prompts suddenly sounded in Xu Que's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for activating the pretending to face-slapping system. This system will escort you and help you pretend to be aggressive and help you fly!"
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully pretending to be aggressive. The reward is 1 point of acting aggressive. Do you want to exchange it in the mall?"
"The system has detected that the host 'Xu Que' has low abilities and is difficult to survive in the difficulty of this world. A special reward for beginners is a big gift bag. Do you want to check the gift bag?"
At the same time as the prompt sounded, a light curtain window popped up in front of him, and several pieces of information data were displayed on it.
Xu Que took a deep breath first, and then burst out laughing uncontrollably. What kind of pretentious face-slapping system is this? It is tailor-made for me when I hear it, and it is a sky-defying system that helps me smash the sky! Now it's time to play.
"The pervert, you are about to die, what are you laughing at?"
Suddenly, a scolding voice pulled Xu Que back from the ecstasy.
At some point, the woman was already standing more than ten meters in front of him, pointing at him with a flying sword in her hand, but staring at him vigilantly and suspiciously with her big Shui Lingling eyes.
"Come on... Do you want to fight with me? If you have the kindness, you can take a step closer to me?"
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully pretending to be aggressive, and the reward is 1 point for acting aggressive."
Sure enough, the system prompt that only he could hear sounded in Xu Que's ear again, and he couldn't help laughing again. "By the way, there seems to be a gift bag."
Suddenly, the screen of the light curtain window in front of him changed, and a square gift box appeared. When the gift box was opened, several streamers of light jumped out and disappeared in a flash.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the first-level experience pill, which can give you 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining two elementary-level escape talismans. After using them, you can instantly move to any place within a five-kilometer radius."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the preliminary "Prime Ancient Five Elements Jue" (Note: The preliminary chapter can only be cultivated to the foundation stage, and can be exchanged at the mall later)."
"Ding, it has been detected that the spiritual root of the host 'Xu Que' is incomplete and does not meet the cultivation requirements. The system will replenish all the spiritual roots for you."
Immediately, Xu Que felt as if an electric current had penetrated his body, and his scalp instantly went numb.
But what followed was a sense of comfort, as if the pores of his body had been completely opened, greedily absorbing spiritual energy from all directions.
boom!
Soon, he felt that his body had undergone earth-shaking changes, and he became closer to nature, as if he could integrate into and control everything.
But he is very clear how familiar this feeling is. Back then, when the Heavenly Fire Spiritual Root was not taken away by the princess, he had such a friendly feeling for the flame. Now the system not only restores his Heavenly Fire Spiritual Root, but also complements it. Spirit root with other attributes.
Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, all five kinds of spiritual roots are all at once, and each of them is the best "heavenly" level.
I'm going to go, this is going against the sky!
Thinking of this, Xu Que finally couldn't help raising his arms and shouting: "With the system in hand, I have the world. What kind of bullshit is the princess and emperor of the Huo Yuan Kingdom? When Xu Que upgrades and returns, I will trample all of you under my feet and smash them to pieces."
"Bold and promiscuous thief, since he claims to be the son-in-law of the Huo Yuan Kingdom, he dares to utter wild words in a vain attempt to kill the king?" The woman next to him was a little dumbfounded. Is this son-in-law lost his mind and gone crazy?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully pretending to be aggressive, gaining 1 point of acting aggressive."
Only then did Xu Que come to his senses, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly, damn it, looking forward to the future, he almost forgot about this trouble, he had to find a way to escape.
"By the way, Experience Dan!"
He suddenly remembered that there was an elementary experience pill in the novice gift pack.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly used his mind to operate the interface, opened a package, and three items appeared in it.
"Use, use." Xu Que stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to host 'Xu Que' for successfully practicing "Imperial Five Elements Jue"."
"Ding, the host 'Xu Que' took the first-level experience pill and gained 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading to the first level of Qi Refining Stage."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading, the current realm is the third level of Qi Refining Stage."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading, the current realm is the tenth level of Qi Refining Stage."
In just a few breaths, Xu Que changed from a mortal with no power to restrain a chicken to an immortal cultivator, and directly sprinted to the tenth floor of the Qi Refining Stage, which was only one step away from the Foundation Establishment Stage.
Moreover, his current strength is infinitely stronger than the tenth floor of the normal Qi refining stage.
The reason is that he has five heavenly roots, which means that a person has five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the mutual generation and mutual restraint attributes of these five different auras, the power that erupts is far more than five times as simple.
"This time I really have nothing to say, who is invincible if I am not invincible?"
Xu Que couldn't stop getting excited. But at this time, the woman on the opposite side waved a streamer of light across the sky, and the sharp blade rushed over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn it, Fairy, I just asked you, a little beauty, to come forward and give my son-in-law a good look. Who told you to use the sword? This is a sneak attack!"
Xu Que was startled when he saw the flying sword coming, and immediately opened his mouth to curse.
But scolding is scolding, but the movements of his feet are unambiguous at all. He slid back, and his fingertips condensed a wisp of water energy, and he flicked lightly on the oncoming sword blade.
"when!"
With a trembling sound, the sharp sword was thrown out by him.
"How can this be?"
The woman was stunned for a moment, the ones in the sect who were able to break this sword so easily, apart from those uncles with profound and unpredictable cultivation, at least those brothers and sisters in the sixth floor of the Foundation Establishment Stage could do it!
"I was puzzled. I said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding. You are still entangled, and you still want to kill me? Don't think that I won't beat you because you look like a fairy. Anyway, I didn't see it clearly just now. Come back and let me take a look at it openly."
Xu Que cursed angrily, stepped out with Yu steps, and the earth element aura immediately melted into the ground, the speed doubled suddenly, and appeared in front of the woman in the blink of an eye.
Immediately afterwards, a ray of water spirit energy gushed out of the palm, surrounding the four directions, and the woman was imprisoned on the spot before she had time to react.
"Prostitute... prostitute, what do you want to do?" The woman turned pale with shock, feeling that the fire essence aura in her body was completely suppressed.
"Hey! Since you call me a prostitute? Then I can't take the blame for nothing."
Xu Que smiled cheaply, raised his eyebrows, and stretched out his hand to grab the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is an afterlife, I will dance with you all over the world!
Nine layers of sky, sea of clouds, wind and thunder tower, a line of sky!
Here, is the Nine Heavens Continent, for three days, a Jedi, Fenglei Terrace! You can catch the wind and thunder, and go in and out of the sky!
But at this moment, on the Fenglei Terrace, there was a bloody mist!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! I'll spare you!"
"Chu Yang, it's a waste of the world's number one fetish like the Nine Tribulations Sword in your hands. It's been so many years and you haven't made any progress. It's simply a waste of money! You'd better hand it over.
There were bursts of loud shouts coming from all directions.
The expression in his eyes was still as calm and steady as a rock! -The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, it is full of meaning that it would rather bend than bend! Even though he has been fatally injured!
Under his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, there were countless broken limbs, dripping with blood.
Looking at the group of masters who were only shouting but not rushing over, Chu Yang had a mocking smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such a person, with such a mind, no matter how high their cultivation is, no matter how many they have; even if they can kill me ten thousand times, they are not worthy of being my enemy!
How could it leak out that the Nine Tribulations Sword was in his hands? After three years of investigation, I was sure that there was a part of the Ninth Tribulation Sword in Fenglei Terrace of Shangtian. After a lot of hard work, I finally found a chance to come to Shangtian at the risk of a narrow escape, but why? After I came here, I encountered such a massive ambush?
Today, I have entered the last three days, and it is only the fifth day! Today's game is purely dead! I have always been famous for my secretive whereabouts. Who knows my plan?
I rushed a dozen times in a row, and every time, I was blocked by someone! And these places I chose are all dead ends!
Extreme love, extreme sword! To destroy emotions into the sword, to enter martial arts with the way of swordsmanship, to seek the way of heaven with martial arts, at the price of lifelong loneliness, to save the world by killing everywhere, but it is a pity that after all, he still cannot practice the Nine Tribulations Sword and the Nine Layers of Heavenly Divine Art!
Is it a wrong choice? Or is this path simply wrong?
Ruthless swordsman Ruthless swordsman, if a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? The way of swordsmanship, martial arts, and heaven are all ruthless after all... But now, at the time of life and death, why are they so shaken?
Nine Tribulations Sword, Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Seeing the eyes all around greedily staring at the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang smiled wryly in his heart. You only know that if you get this Nine Tribulations Sword, you will be invincible in the world, but do you know how much I paid for this Nine Tribulations Sword?
There is nothing left.
With blood flowing, Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was passing by quickly. He pursued martial arts all his life, fell in love, broke up with love, gave up love until he was ruthless, and then extinguished love. At the moment of dying, he thought that the only regret should be He hadn't reached the highest realm he pursued for a lifetime in his lifetime, but what he didn't expect was that at this moment, a figure popped up in his mind, which he thought he had long forgotten.
Mo Qingwu, Chu Yang's infatuated woman!
"It turns out that I haven't really broken my heart..." Chu Yang muttered to himself with a self-deprecating smile.
A trace of remorse quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, engulfing his entire heart in an instant.
light dance! I don't know if I go to Huangquan this time, may I meet you?
"Let's go together! Just chop him up! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, it's not too late for us to discuss it slowly!" One person shouted: "If not, after he replies, it will be our turn to spend a lot of money!" Nuo, immediately raised his swords and surrounded Chu Yang.
"I don't dance lightly in my life, and I dance for a lifetime of suffering; I dance for the king in this life, and I dance for a lifetime of suffering!"
This is a small poem written by Mo Qingwu on the night of making love. I still remember that Mo Qingwu had tears in her eyes at that time, and her eyes were bewildered and resentful. She... knew that she was using her love to practice martial arts, but she still threw herself into her arms like a moth to a flame, letting herself feel as much as she wanted combustion!
After I heard the news, I rushed there immediately, but after all, I was one step too late. Although I later killed all the members of the family that hurt Mo Qingwu, even the nine clans, but the beauty could not be resurrected after all!
That peerless beauty, when she was about to die, lay softly in her arms and said to herself: "Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife... if I can still meet you, I hope you can take a good... look at me I am more beautiful than a sword!"
Qing Wu, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how could there be tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two drops of clear tears smashed my heart to pieces at that moment! From then on, this heart is dusty!
Life and death go hand in hand to the sky!
This is a poem specially composed by Xue Leihan, the number one talented person in the world, because of Mo Qingwu's deep affection for Chu Yang.
And now, Qing Wu, you have reached the Nine Heavens, but I am still in this world...but, I will be with you life and death immediately... life after life!
Chu Yang was lost in thought, a gentle and sad smile appeared on the corner of his usually cold mouth.
Qingwu, wait for me!
Qingwu, you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice some kind of swordsmanship, I would rather not have some peak, I would rather not have revenge, and I would rather be with you! In this world, what can be worth your satisfied smile?
No! Not bitter...Qing Wu, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter, now...I am very bitter!
More and more swords were added to the body, blood flew out little by little, and pain focused from all over the body little by little, finally interrupting the singing and dancing in my mind!
Chu Yang roared furiously! Standing up suddenly, the long black hair flew up violently!
Chu Yang felt a pain in his heart, and looked down, the jade pendant hanging around his neck shattered before his eyes. In an instant, he was about to burst into tears!
This is the only memory Qing Wu left for herself!
"Kill!" Chu Yang raised his head suddenly, with murderous intent rushing in his eyes, and with a shout, the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand suddenly glowed with thousands of sword lights, like nine days of lightning suddenly connecting into a belt of light around his waist!
With a bang bang bang bang bang, all the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
Everyone backed away in a hurry, looking in horror at the neat circle of weapons under Chu Yang's feet, with cold sweat dripping down his vest. Unexpectedly, the power of the Nine Tribulations Sword's strike is so terrifying!
Chu Yang looked around, and suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and said slowly: "Okay! I'll show you the Nine Tribulations Sword!"
He jumped up suddenly! He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, but he jumped up!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a little bit of cold light shines!"
As the arc shot out, thousands of cold lights rushed out!
Nine Heavens Sword Art! One sword!
Nine Heavens is the name of this continent. All the sword arts in history have never dared to use these three words to name them, but this Nine Tribulations Sword Art directly uses the name "Nine Heavens"!
Throughout the ages, this is the only set!
Although Chu Yang could not display the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword Art, he had comprehended these swords for a long time. Although the power of these swords is not as great as imagined, it is far beyond the worldly swordsmanship.
Dozens of masters around, knowing that this sword is no small matter, all of them used their skills to resist this attack with all their strength! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapons in their hands, and they were almost unsteady.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, it doesn't matter if it slaughters the whole world!"
Before the first move is finished, the second move has already arrived with a murderous look! The rushing rays of light are like the rising tide of the sea, and boundless murderous intent bursts out overwhelmingly!
There was a scream, and more than a dozen masters who could dominate one side tried their best to resist at the same time, but they were still covered in blood and retreated in embarrassment!
At this moment, everyone had an illusion: the current Chu Yang was definitely not injured! Absolutely in perfect condition!
But they didn't know that they interrupted Chu Yang's memories, interrupted Mo Qingwu's singing and dancing, and made Chu Yang completely furious, fully exerting all the potential of his body! This is the power of life, the fury of the soul!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, once the wind and clouds gather, you will be the emperor!"
Chu Yang suddenly opened his eyes and growled, "Why? Why not?"
In the distance, in three directions, three kinds of light rose at the same time, turning into three golden shadows in the air! Dazzling in panic, with an incomparable arrogance.
I am just a Martial Lord, although I am only one level away from the king level, but this level is no different from the difference between heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a great deal!
"However, these three days are not a place for you, a mere Poison Sword Martial Master, to run wild!" One person said gently: "It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly, what a pity!"
Following the words, the other two appeared together. The three of them were all in wide robes with long sleeves, their skirts fluttering, and they came against the wind. His posture is chic and his face is calm.
Chu Yang's eyes were a little blurred: "You three kings... also want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
"I want you to die!" The three of them smiled at the same time, with a demeanor: "However, taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword by the way is also considered a windfall. Great harvest!"
Chu Yang smiled coldly, straightened his back, and said proudly: "It's a pity that you don't understand the Nine Tribulations Sword! You will never get it!" His eyes became determined, determined!
He is now powerless to fight anymore!
This is the only sword that he can display its full power. When he first saw the sword formula, he knew that this sword could be used by himself. But such a sword needs to be activated with one's own life!
It was the Nine Tribulations Sword Soul who killed people on his own and destroyed everything!
The three kings almost didn't even have time to parry, and they didn't even have time to scream before they were wiped out! Even, the golden shadows transformed by their king-level power are still flashing in the air, but their lives have been reduced to nothing!
Chu Yang sighed. He was in mid-air, and he cast his eyes casually, only to find a person who he thought should never appear here. In the distance, a white-clothed man stared at him dumbfounded, his face full of disbelief.
"Secret?" Chu Yang's eyes remained fixed, and he finally understood. Why was someone ambushing me for such a secretive action, and why all my attacks were accurately calculated and intercepted!
It turned out to be him, and Mo Tianji was plotted by God. No wonder I was such a complete failure!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air, and fell down slowly, just like the dead leaves falling in late autumn, falling on the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, he murmured: "Qingwu, if there is in the next life, I will dance with you all over the world!"
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest enthusiasm and the strongest longing! Because there, I have my own lover!
Chapter two
Meng Qi's secret joy was interrupted, and his complacency turned into embarrassment. Zhende and other young novice monks looked at him with surprise and contempt. "Looking blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, he looked like he was wandering in the sky.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head and looked at Xuanzang next to him. Did he see any clues?
For him, embarrassment and frustration are trivial matters, but exposing the fact that he has resurrected from a dead body is a big problem!
Xuanzang still had a bitter expression on his face and dejected eyes. After feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he shook his head lightly: "Namo Amitabha, everything depends on Xuanku's decision." He didn't hint, just said it directly.
Uh, he thought I thought he was pleading with him...Meng Qi was relieved inwardly, knowing that he had passed this test, unless the parents who abandoned this body, the horse-faced uncle, etc. came to him, he should not be seen through Well, if it takes another ten or eight years, no one will doubt it even more. The memories of childhood are easy to forget.
Compared to this, breaking into the handyman's courtyard is just a trivial matter!
Meng Qi, who was playing crookedly, tried his best to make his expression as dull as Zhenhui's, lest Xuanzang see through that he was not so depressed and sad.
After the broad-faced and big-eared Xuan Ku questioned the remaining children one by one, together with Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, a total of six of them entered the Handyman's Academy, and the rest belonged to the Martial Monk Academy.
The ruler in his right hand lightly tapped his left palm: "Follow me to go to the miscellaneous yard to get a shave, to receive monk robes and Buddhist scriptures, and so on. I will live hard in the future. I might not have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma schools to practice advanced Buddhist scriptures and martial arts."
There is also Bodhidharma here?
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuan Ku didn't give him time to think, and walked straight past the children to the outside of the hall.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi dared not ask more questions. He followed closely behind the two yellow-clothed monks, Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, and turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You don't count as formal entry, you just need to pay homage to the Buddha, get shaved and leave your name." Xuan Ku pointed to the futon in the small Buddhist hall.
"Yes, Uncle Xuanku." The children followed Zhende in response, and then knelt on the futon one by one, kowtowing to the golden Buddha statue above.
After all the children had worshiped the Buddha, Xuanku clasped his hands together, Bao Xiang solemnly bowed to the Buddha statue, and chanted "Namo Amitabha Buddha". Then, he walked up to a child and stroked his right hand on the top of his head.
The child's long black hair changed immediately, turning to withered yellow at a speed visible to Meng Qi's naked eyes, and fell to the ground like fallen leaves. In less than two breaths, the child became a real little novice monk.
"The troubles are gone, and the world of mortals is far away." Xuan Ku said solemnly, and his mellow voice echoed in the pure Buddhist hall.
"What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!"
Meng Qi was astonished and excited. Will he have the opportunity to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuan Ku walked up to the children one by one, shaved off their hair, and kept saying the same words.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, silently recited the name of Buddha and Taoist, and mourned the hair that was about to bid farewell to him.
The thick and wide palm stroked the top of Meng Qi's head lightly, and the withered hairs fell before his eyes. , I never thought of becoming a monk.
"The troubles are all gone, and the world of mortals is far away."
Xuan Ku's voice was like a chime bell ringing suddenly, making Meng Qi tremble all over, and his mind was cleared.
But after Xuanku left and Chengjing disappeared, Meng Qi's belief was still firm, and he must return to vulgarity in the future!
After worshiping Buddha, shaving his head, and leaving a name for the monk, Xuan Ku asked several gray-clothed monks to take the group of children to the backyard to get their own things—two sets of gray monk robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, "Shaolin Precepts", "Morning Lesson" Twelve Little Curses" and so on.
"After you have learned the characters in the 'Lecture Institute', you can recite the precepts of the temple and the morning class mantra. Before that, I will briefly talk about the main precepts of the temple. First, you must not deceive your master and destroy your ancestors. Allowed, no stealing martial arts, third, no killing, fourth, no drinking, fifth, no meat, sixth, no sex..." Xuan Ku repeated the main commandments that need to be obeyed several times, and finally said solemnly: "Those who violate it will be scolded at the slightest, and their martial arts will be abolished if they are serious, and they will be expelled from the temple."
He only mentioned two of the punishments, which are the lightest and the heaviest. The rest include coolie punishment, scripture copying, staff punishment, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the "miscellaneous yard" with the group of young monks.
"In this temple, those who wear gray robes are the general monks, those who wear yellow robes are the deacons of each courtyard, and those who wear yellow robes and red cassocks are the abbots, heads of each courtyard, and elders..." Along the way, Xuan Ku relentlessly instilled "common knowledge in the monastery" into the young novice monks, until Zhende and others entered the "monk monastery". before he became silent again.
The group of people walked further and further away. Inside and outside the yellow wall, there were green trees, and there were few Buddhist temples. After a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled and old courtyard.
"Oh, Brother Xuanku, Brother Xuanzang, did you come so early?" At the door, a big fat monk greeted him with a smile. He was also dressed in yellow clothes, but his collar was slanted and his belly was shy.
Xuan Ku frowned, and he said meticulously, "Namo Amitabha, Senior Brother Xuanxin, how can you be so lazy?"
The big fat monk Xuan Xin has long been familiar with Xuan Ku's temper, and said without getting angry at all: "Oh, you are too obsessed with appearance, is this for our disciples from the Miscellaneous House?" He was unwilling to discuss this issue with Xuan Ku Bitterly entangled, he pointed directly at Meng Qi and the others.
"Senior Brother Xuan Xin, please arrange it." Xuan Ku replied solemnly.
At this time, Xuanzang, who had been making saw-mouthed gourds, suddenly said, "Zhenying, is Zhenguan still in the handyman's yard?"
"Still, still!" The fat monk Xuanxin said suspiciously: "Brother Xuanzang, what are you asking them for? Do you intend to accept them as disciples?"
Xuanzang shook his head, and sighed: "My martial art has been ruined, so I don't want to mislead my disciples, why dare I accept disciples? Brother Xuanxin, please let them live with Zhenying and Zhenguan."
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhen Hui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently. This was the first time Xuanzang took the initiative to arrange his own affairs. Could it be that the two monks Zhenying and Zhenguan had something special that could help him?
"Haha, senior brother Xuanzang, how can I dare to say 'trouble' about what you ordered? Why do you need to do such a trivial matter?" Xuan Xin agreed without hesitation.
Xuan Ku glanced sideways at Xuan Zang, didn't say much, but said seriously to Meng Qi, Zhen Hui and other young novice monks: "The reason I put you in the handyman's yard is because you all have problems. If you understand and sharpen your mind, you may not have the opportunity to enter the Wu Monk Academy, the Bodhidharma Academy, or even the Bodhi Academy in the future."
"But if you continue to steal, cheat, be lazy, playful, impetuous, and unbearable to suffer, I will not hide it. I will definitely report it to the Discipline Academy and punish you accordingly."
He spoke out his thoughts without any concealment, to show his frankness and lack of selfishness, which made Xuan Xin beside him blush slightly.
"Yes, Master Xuanku." Meng Qi and other young monks answered in unison.
After watching Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted her body, causing the pieces of fat to shake up and down: "I'm finally gone, I'm most afraid of seeing this iron-masked ghost."
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to look sideways, and followed Xuan Xin, who was swaying here and there, into the meditation room.
"Zhenying, Zhenguan, this is your junior brother Zhending and Zhenhui." After pointing to Meng Qi and Zhenhui, Xuan Xin turned around and took the other young novice monks to another meditation room.
Inside the meditation room, there is a bunk, which can accommodate seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
On the bunk, two gray-clothed monks were lying down and sitting, both in their twenties. The one who was lying down had a dull expression and was speechless. The one who was sitting had his brows furrowed, and his tone was cold: "Package, etc. Just lay the bottom. If you want to drink water, you can get it from the water tank in the courtyard." "I don't know what the name of the brother is?"
Meng Qi glanced at the dull Zhenhui, and decided to open up a good "roommate relationship" by himself.
The person sitting said coldly: "Zhenguan."
After answering, he stopped talking, and even turned away from looking at Meng Qi and Zhenhui, making it impossible for Meng Qi to talk about getting closer.
As for Zhenying, he closed his eyes and continued to sleep.
Who are these people!
Meng Qi slandered secretly, but on the surface he said to Zhenhui with a smile: "Brother Zhenhui, I'm Zhending, you can just call me brother in the future."
"Yes, Senior Brother." Zhenhui called out without embarrassment at all.
Or this silly little guy!
Meng Qi secretly sighed, and decided to play the role of senior brother and help Zhenhui: "Junior brother, hey, I'll call you junior brother, come on, let's change into monk clothes first."
Although there were people in the room, Meng Qi, who used to enjoy the cool in the dormitory shirtless when he was in college, didn't feel uncomfortable. He quickly took off his clothes and changed into a monk's robe.
While silently thanking the simplicity of wearing the monk's robe so that he would not look ugly, he checked the things on his body that he hadn't had time to look at before.
The robes of this body are finely woven and soft in texture. Even if Meng Qi doesn't know the goods, he can tell that they are of great value. At the same time, "he" has a transparent jade pendant hanging from his waist and a A small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red string was pressed against the chest, refreshing and cool, so uncomfortable.
Meng Qi played with the thumb-sized Jade Buddha carefully, and saw that "it" had a compassionate face and was lifelike. It was obviously carved with extraordinary craftsmanship. At the same time, "it" had a delicate touch, which was warm and refreshing.
"According to what Uncle Malian said, was this Jade Buddha given by an unknown old monk? But since Master Hou didn't take it away, it's probably not an extraordinary product, so it's better to wear it next to your body."
Meng Qi hung the Jade Buddha pendant on his chest again, and hid it next to his body, then packed up the jade pendant, clothes, etc., and put them under the berth he had chosen.
At this time, Zhen Ying, who had been sleeping all this time, suddenly turned over and sat up, quickly put on his shoes and went out, Meng Qi was taken aback for a moment, not understanding what happened.
"It's dinner time." Zhen Guan said coldly, got out of the bunk and walked out the door.
Who are these two!
Meng Qi cursed again, then turned his head to Zhenhui and said, "Little Junior Brother, are you alright? It's dinner time!"
"Okay!" As soon as Zhenhui finished speaking, the little figure rushed to the door like a rabbit, as if he was already very hungry.
"..." Meng Qi was suddenly embarrassed. Could it be that he is the only one who is normal here?
Zhenhui stopped at the door suddenly, turned her head to look at Meng Qi, her face was full of doubts: "Brother, why don't you go?"
You have a conscience and know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought to himself, and then replied half-jokingly, "I'm not as hungry as you guys."
Looking at you one or two, it's like a starving ghost reincarnated! \Q>
He turned around and ran away.
Hello! After shivering a few times, he shouted loudly: "Hey, little brother, wait for me!"
Suddenly, a burst of sadness hit his heart, other people's junior sisters, why do I only have junior juniors, and there will be no junior sisters in the foreseeable future.
Under the heavy rain, a beautiful-looking woman aged twenty-seven or eight, and a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling, and she comes from a remote mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to university with dreams and hopes, but she never expected to meet a man who changed everything for her. This man is the famous young girl in Beitang City... ... Li Zhe!
Then! Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in the same school. In an accident, she was spotted by Li Zhe, and then Li Zhe pursued Zhao Meiling crazily.
And Zhao Meiling is just a simple and simple girl who just came to the city, she will be the opponent of such a master in love, not only the body, but also the heart is completely handed over to him, but after Li Zhe got tired of her, he ruthlessly abandoned her.
Later, Zhao Meiling found out that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the child, so she did not hesitate to fall out with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling originally wanted to raise him alone, but five years later, due to overwork, she became terminally ill and had few years left to live. She finally decided to send the child to the Li family, hoping that the child would feel the love of his father and have a better life. So she can rest assured after death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, completely refusing to admit that the child belonged to their Li family. Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with the child, begging bitterly.
At this time, the iron door opened slowly, and several people came out holding umbrellas. The man in the head looked a bit like the little boy, and he was the little boy's father, Li Zhe.
"Here! Damn woman, this sum of money is enough for you to live well," Li Zhe frowned, and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must keep Fu'er, he is your son!"
Li Zhe refused immediately, and then said coldly, "Do you want the money?"
Hearing this, Zhao Meiling was already in tears and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, who was kneeling on the ground, hugged Li Zhe's thigh and begged bitterly, "Zhe!"
"Snapped!"
Before Zhao Meiling finished speaking, Li Zhe slapped her heavily on the face, "Let go! You stinky woman".
Seeing his mother being beaten, the little boy next to him ran over and hugged Li Zhe's thigh, and shouted childishly, "Dad! Don't beat mom."
In fact, the little boy didn't know who his father was since he was born, and his mother never said anything about it. It wasn't until Zhao Meiling showed Li Zhe's photo to the little boy that he knew he had a father. I was so happy that I almost jumped up.
But now, he doesn't understand why his father wants to beat his mother instead of his mother.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy hugging his thigh with a look of disgust on his face, and kicked the little boy away, "Who is your father, die~ wild~!"
The little boy was kicked and flew out, fell to the ground, curled up, and covered his stomach in pain. The pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear. Eye sockets flowed out.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, she quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked nervously, "Fu'er, are you okay?"
Seeing his mother's worried expression, the little boy pursed his lips, held back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe walked into the iron gate without even looking at the mother and son. Next to him was a man with gray hair who looked like a housekeeper. He picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling. Take it!"
Zhao Meiling shook her head, hugged the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the backs of the mother and child, sighed deeply, turned and walked into the house, and slowly closed the iron door.
Four years later! Before Zhao Meiling died, she called the nine-year-old boy who had grown up to the bedside, gently rubbed his head, and said with a weak smile, "Fuer, you should study hard in the future so that you can have a good job in the future." Good job, and don't resent the Li family, and don't resent your father, promise me, please?"
The little boy held back his tears and nodded seriously.
Seeing the little boy seriously nodding in agreement, Zhao Meiling had a serene smile on her face, and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the middle of the night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shone on the earth, making the surroundings not dark.
"boom!"
Suddenly there was a deafening sound in the sky. Zhao Fu was startled, and looked up at the sky, only to see that the whole sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of flames, with countless colorful rays of light and long tails, like shooting stars. Fall from the sky.
"boom!"
There was a loud noise, and a shooting star emitting colorful light landed in front of Zhao Fu. The dazzling light made Zhao Fu block it with his hand, and then the strong light dissipated. A spar that was one finger long and two finger thick quietly floated in the distance. The ground is two meters high in the air.
Zhao Fu stepped forward curiously, grabbed the spar, and the spar floated in mid-air without any response, but Zhao Fu grabbed it.
At this time, people who were sleeping soundly were awakened by a series of loud noises. They opened the doors or windows, looked at the countless spars floating in mid-air, and began to rush out of the house frantically to snatch the spars. Stay longer and return to your home quickly.
In a single rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the spar. If it was just based on appearance, there is no gemstone that can compare to this spar. If the quantity is rare, it is worth nothing. But the key is falling from the sky. There are too many, at least tens of billions of dollars, so this spar may not be worth much at all.
"Detect the host as a primary intelligence body, start soul binding...".
Ding! The soul is bound successfully and begins to go to the world of apocalypse.
After the sound, Zhao Fu's eyes went black and he passed out on the ground. "Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, died because he bravely rescued two children who were about to be hit by a car. After research and decision by relevant departments, Hong Dali was named a hero and an outstanding university student in the province."
"No, no, no, I don't want to go to Hong's house to get married with you!" Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow and kicked Bai Nen's calf desperately: "Hong Dali is a well-known trash in the whole city. The face of the family is all lost, and the person is sick, not to mention not smart, but still a standard prodigal son, I don't want such a person to be my fiance!"
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Ruisi, the chairman of Tang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is multi-talented and knowledgeable. Not to mention, she is also beautiful and beautiful, a gentle lady, who combines the spirit of heaven and earth, especially good at cooking, and the standard is good. There is a large bed above the kitchen under the hall. It is the dream lover of many boys at school.
But today, she heard her father say that she would take him to Hong Dali's family, who is famous for his prodigal family, to be married. How could she bear it: "If it weren't for his parents doting on her, a single seedling in a thousand hectares of land, just like him The trash has long been expelled from the Hong family to fend for itself. How can there be a chance to prosper like this all day long?"
After hearing her daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, who was sitting on the bedside, showed a wry smile, and said helplessly: "Xinxin, I can't help it either."
The marriage between you and Hong Dali was decided by your grandfather himself back then. Although he was a bit of a prodigal, it's not a big problem, right?
Tang Ruisi was wearing a blue-gray vest with a spotless white sweater inside, a simple bow tie on the collar, a light stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, and short black hair combed back He is meticulous and shiny, and his overall image is quite good, but his eyes that were originally piercing are now full of helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really forced into a corner, how could he be willing to give away his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dali can be called a wonderful flower in the world. The only thing he likes to do or can do is two words: prodigal.
His most famous sentence is: "I have to be a prodigal, won't my parents' talent to make money be wasted if I am not a prodigal?"
This sentence can be regarded as a joke that everyone in Tianjing City knows. Many parents will say this when educating their children: "If you dare to imitate that prodigal Hong Dali, I won't break your legs!"
Therefore, it is indeed reasonable for Tang Muxin to have such a big reaction.
"That's true..." Tang Ruisi frowned and thought for a while, then suddenly his eyes lit up, and he said, "Xinxin, how about this? Let's get married first, and when Dad's company returns to normal, then we will find another excuse to withdraw the marriage. This time our research funds exceeded the budget. Once the funds catch up, as long as the research of this project is successful, it will definitely be a major event in the world. When we recover, we will find a way to withdraw the marriage. His family shouldn't say anything more, right?"
Tang Muxin sobbed, "It's easy to get engaged but difficult to withdraw. His family is one of the world's top 500 companies. How can it be so easy?"
I have to say that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her house collapses, her fate will definitely not be so good. This world is like this, the weak eat the strong. When you are strong, no one may dare to touch you, but when your family is really in trouble, there will definitely be many people who come to make trouble for you.
For example, the young master of the Liu family who has been pestering her all the time at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way but this method, so she could only get up unwillingly: "Then, let's try it first, woo, Dad, in the future, you must remember to withdraw your marriage, I don't want to marry that prodigal son!"
"Well, okay, for the sake of my family Xinxin, Dad will try his best." Tang Ruisi sighed, and patted Tang Muxin's shoulder: "Xinxin, let's go."
Hong Dali sat on the bed with blank eyes and a mess in his mind.
The surrounding environment was very strange, and there was a big problem with the memory in his mind. Now he can barely recall the screeching sound of brakes, and the rest are some messy memories that don't belong to him at all.
"Aren't I dead? Here, where is it?" Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself: "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live. So, where is this place?"
He looked left and right for a while, thinking: "The most urgent thing is to figure out the current situation first."
"One, am I dead or alive now. Two, what is this place and who is my identity. Three, what should I do next."
"Then let's look at the first point first." Hong Dali pinched a small piece of oily skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and said, "It hurts, so I should be alive." He touched it carefully again Touch the face, neck, ears, and top of the head: "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the scope of human beings."
"Then the next question is, what is this place and who is my identity?" Hong Dali looked around again, the reinforced concrete house structure, white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, even There is also a computer with a 30-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room: "It is a modern society, but I have never seen the stars on the surrounding walls, and I have never heard of all kinds of toy models." In this way, this world should be the legendary parallel space?"
With no one around, Hong Dali carefully stood up and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak, like a thin bamboo pole. I really don't know when it will suddenly die suddenly."
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali opened a few URLs at random, and the displayed content was quite different from that on Earth, but at least it made him understand a few things: "First, the writing in this world or this country is still Chinese characters. Second, It is indeed a parallel space. Many things are different from the earth, but they are not too different.
No ID card? After thinking about it, he quickly felt relieved: "Hehe, the age of this body should not be very high, about seventeen or eighteen years old. The ID card may be issued, but it is more likely that it has not been issued yet. After all, this world is different from the earth, and some slight differences are normal. "
"The big prodigal system is successfully bound, the current level: level one."
After the introduction of the system sound, a villain suddenly appeared in Hong Dali's mind, which seemed to be him.
"Host name: Hong Dali."
Sexual capacity: 32. Note: Each index is 100 for normal people. "
Hong Dali looked dumbfounded: "The big prodigal system? Is this thing real or fake?
Fortunately, there is no unparalleled road, and Hong Dali was wishing to commit suicide when the metallic sound of the system came again: "Explanation: For every 100,000 yuan (RMB) that the host loses, you can get an attribute point.
When all the attributes of the host reach the level of a normal person, the prodigal system will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added at that time, please look forward to it. "
"Can you get attribute points?" At this time, there is really nothing better than being able to improve one's attributes, Hong Dali smiled brightly, "I can really get attribute points through prodigal, so that I can become like a normal person." Same?"
Although the system's voice was still so cold, it sounded like a singing voice to my ears: "Yes."
Hong Dali was so excited that he almost jumped up: "I want to squander! I want to prodigal!"
"Next, please ask the host to take over the first task: the first time to prodigal. Task requirements: at least 100,000 yuan to prodigal before midnight today.
"Current prodigal amount: 0."
"Damn it, it's already eight o'clock in the evening! There are only four hours left. No, I want to go out! I want to prodigal!"
Just thinking of this, the door of the room was pushed open suddenly, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali, and said softly: "Master Dali, Master and Madam let you go, please follow me .”
"Can you buy me a game pod?" Jiang Fei asked his father expectantly.
"Xiao Fei, you are in high school now, you can no longer be addicted to games like before!"
"Mom! This game is different! This is a masterpiece produced by Shengshi Company for thirteen years, and it is called the second world of mankind!"
The game called "Dawn" mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in human history. It is not only a model of virtual reality games, the degree of simulation is close to 100%, and through a brand new technology, players can Experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physically, but mentally can experience a completely different magical life for twenty-four hours!
"This game is being promoted all over the country! It's not a lie. Not only will this game not affect learning, but it can also make people have a better rest!"
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
"I said the last time, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework within 20 seconds, then next month's allowance will be cut by 50%!" Dad said with a straight face.
"Old stubborn!"
Jiang Fei murmured in a low voice, but he also knew that there was nothing to talk about. His family was in good condition. It was definitely not that his father was reluctant to buy this game pod. Impact learning! "Brother Fei, how is it? "Dawn" will officially open tonight. Have you prepared the game pod yet?"
As soon as the get out of class bell rang and the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei grabbed his shoulder and asked.
Don't mention it, I can't play with you this time! " Jiang Fei smiled wryly!
The brothers are all pointing at you! "
The little fat man Zhao Feng said anxiously, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in school, and Jiang Fei's senior high school class 19 is the key class of the school. However, Jiang Fei's grades are in the middle, and his grades are neither high nor low. Not good, and not very good at interpersonal communication, so it can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree, what can I do?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, he had nothing to say to his only friend.
"Why don't the brothers chip in to buy one for you?" Zhao Feng said, because the conditions are similar to Jiang Fei's, they are the kind of guys who are not outstanding in all aspects, so the relationship between these two transparent people who don't get the attention of teachers and classmates The relationship is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"hope so!"
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei liked playing games since he was a child, especially this kind of realistic games. As a boy, who doesn't want to be a swordsman? A man should carry a three-foot sword and make great achievements. This is the dream of every man, but in peaceful times, and in a society with highly advanced technology, let alone no war, even if there is war, you still need to press the button, so If you want to enjoy the blood of fighting, you can only experience it in a virtual game!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless. Since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been ordered by his father to restrict entertainment. All the game devices at home are sealed, and online games are even more exempt!
Finally, when school was over, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly. Although it was only around six o'clock in the evening at this time, it was getting dark very early because it was already winter.
Thinking that today is the opening day of "Dawn", Jiang Fei locked himself in his room angrily! At about ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework. He lay on his back on his bed, watching the wall clock on the wall approaching the ten o'clock position bit by bit, feeling a little uncomfortable.
The opening time of "Dawn" is 10 o'clock this evening, and then it will run for eight hours a day from ten o'clock to six o'clock in the morning of the next day. playtime! "Hey! I don't have a share in such a great game!"
While muttering, Jiang Fei subconsciously stroked the ring on his index finger.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei opened his mouth wide open, looking at the faintly glowing ring on his hand, he was so frightened that he couldn't speak!
"Buzz!"
A white light flashed, and Jiang Fei's eyes blurred. When his sight became clear again, it was no longer his room!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of "Dawn"! Novice Assistant No. 34784 is at your service!"
A crisp female voice came into Jiang Fei's ears!
""Dawn"? Is this the login interface of "Dawn"?"
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface!" The novice assistant replied.
Jiang Fei is still a little hard to imagine, he doesn't have a game cabin at all, how can he enter the game?
Maybe this is my dream! It may be that I was too tired after finishing my homework, so I fell asleep on the bed, including the mysterious ring just now. I am afraid it is part of the dream. I think about it every day and dream at night. Maybe it is because I want to play this game too much. up! Chapter One
"Liar! Big liar!"
An angry shout, followed by the sound of running away on the bluestone ground.
Zhang Xuan stretched out his hands helplessly: "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher of the academy... I just want you to be my student! Besides, even if I'm a liar, why do you need to add the word 'big'?"
After muttering, remembering what the director of politics and education said, Zhang Xuan rubbed his brows: "It's the seventeenth! If I can't even recruit a single student today, I can pack up and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Xuan is not from this world, but an administrator of an ordinary university library on Earth. He only remembers the raging fire, and then... there is no more, and he woke up to this world again.
Similar to what was described in the novel, martial arts are respected, strength is king!
I thought I could pass through a good-for-nothing, get divorced, and then slap my face and counterattack, singing along the way... It seems that I thought too much, but when I got here, I realized that it was not a student, but... a teacher!
The saddest teacher in the entire academy!
Others' classrooms were overcrowded, so crowded that they couldn't sit down, but there was no one in his classroom, and he finally pulled a few in. In the end, he even scolded "liar" several times, turned around and ran away!
The reason is that the guy who was pierced by his own soul has the lowest strength among teachers, and his eyesight is extremely poor, so he can't see anything. The key... He also taught wrongly, and there was a case of becoming crazy!
This is like a dead person in the hospital. His reputation is greatly damaged and he is spurned by others. Even the new students stay away from each other, for fear that they will fall into his hands and be taught to die!
There are no students, and it has been criticized. Last year's teacher evaluation, the entire college ranked last, and it even got the only zero score in history.
Depressed, he drank his sorrows with wine, but died as he wished, and took the opportunity to cross over by himself.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum. If he couldn't enroll another student in his class this year, he would be expelled from the teaching qualification immediately!
Seventeen new students have passed by his classroom today, and as a result, when they heard their names, they all ran away without exception, like a little girl who ran as fast as she met a strange sorghum.
"It seems that we must find a way to fool one!"
I was thinking in my heart how to open my mouth to pull people, when I saw a girl with a cute face poking her head out from the door.
"Excuse me, is this Teacher Lu Xun's classroom?"
The voice is sweet and lovely, and the appearance is delicate and pleasant.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the academy, the classroom is always full, and countless people come here admiringly.
"That's her!" Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up when he saw someone throwing himself into the trap.
Recalling all the pretentious routines I have seen in my previous life, I sat quietly on my seat, posing as an outsider: "Do you want to worship him as your teacher?"
The girl nodded like a sparrow, and her dark eyes were full of admiration: "I heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian Academy, and the students of the professor are all extraordinary in strength. Everyone is proud to be able to join his class." !"
"No matter how good his speech is, if it doesn't match your cultivation theory, not only will he not make progress, but he will even retreat! The teacher is not well-known, but if he agrees with your theory, he can make rapid progress and greatly increase his cultivation!"
"That's right... I also heard my brother say something similar!" The girl froze for a moment, her beautiful eyes were a little confused: "However, I don't know what kind of class I am suitable for!"
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up, he hesitated for a moment, Marx, Enkos and other sages appeared one after another in his mind, pretending to be embarrassed: "Meeting is fate, how about this, I am also a teacher of this academy, I can free Help you look at your roots, talents, and dispositions, and help you recommend a suitable teacher by the way!" "Then I will trouble you, sir!"
Unexpectedly, the teacher she met casually was so generous, the girl nodded excitedly.
"Show me your cultivation first and let me see!"
Zhang Xuan's eyes were half-opened and half-closed, as if he didn't care.
"yes!"
Hurrah!
After a short while, the fist wind roared in the room, and streams of Qi rushed around the girl like a dragon swimming. The whole person's breath was condensed but not scattered, and the power was not obvious, which represented that she had an excellent foundation.
"Okay, I can see that you usually practice hard, have a solid foundation, and have excellent talent. You are a rare genius!" After a set of punches, Zhang Xuan nodded in satisfaction.
He learned it from a fortune teller on Earth. His words are all panacea, and the scope is very wide. People can't hear the mistakes, but secretly call them accurate.
"Teacher, I was injured on my leg. According to the doctor, it's basically useless..." The girl interrupted his eloquence, with some doubts in her eyes.
"Injured..." Zhang Xuan blushed, but with a thick skin, others couldn't see it, and continued to rave about: "Do you think I didn't see it? I knew it when you used your power just now! That's why I said that because... nothing can be broken, nothing can be built!"
Anyway, it's all fooling, if you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense, first fool a disciple over and then talk.
"Opportunity? Teacher, what kind of opportunity is it?" The girl's eyes lit up.
After her leg was injured, she always felt that she was inferior to others, and secretly felt inferior. She never thought that there might be a blessing in disguise.
"This opportunity can make you soar into the sky, and it is not an exaggeration to become the number one freshman. After all, your talent is already very good, and you are a peerless genius, but..." Zhang Xuan kept talking, and almost didn't show it. A copy of "Tathagata God's Palm".
Hearing that she could be the number one freshman, and praised her as a genius, the girl couldn't help showing a fiery face, and asked quickly: "But, what?"
"However..." Zhang Xuan sighed, with a sigh that a good talent is about to be buried: "There are not many teachers who can see this kind of opportunity in the whole academy!
"No students?" The girl had high hopes, but her eyes dimmed a little when she heard this, and then she jumped up suddenly after thinking about something: "They don't accept students, so teacher...do you accept it?"
"Of course I still accept it, but, as you can see, I don't care about fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!"
Plop!
Before she could finish speaking, the girl prostrated herself on the ground: "I know Mr. Gao Jie, please accept me as an apprentice! I will definitely practice hard and not lose face to my teacher!"
"Students promise not to disturb the teacher unless it is absolutely necessary!" Seeing his reluctance, the girl nodded quickly with a sincere look on her face.
"I don't have many students, so I may not be as good as other teachers in terms of resources, and I will be criticized by others..." Zhang Xuan continued.
"That's it... I heard that refining resources is very important..." The girl hesitated.
Teachers receive resources from the college, which are linked to many conditions such as the grades and quantity of the students they teach. If the resources are not enough, it will be difficult to improve in cultivation.
"Ahem, I said that on purpose to test you. Since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I will reluctantly accept you!" Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Xuan immediately interrupted, and hastily said: "Identity Verify it!"
"This... so fast?"
Unexpectedly, the teacher changed his face like flipping through a book, so fast, the girl was slightly taken aback, took the token that Zhang Xuan handed over to represent her identity, and was considering whether to verify it, when she saw the very calm teacher Zhang, who had already pulled her over With the palm of his hand, he took out a sharp knife and swiped lightly, a drop of blood fell on the jade tablet.
hum!
The light flickered.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't the teacher just say that he should think about it and be indifferent to fame and fortune? Why are you moving so fast, and...the knives are all ready?
"From now on, you are my student!" Zhang Xuan heaved a sigh of relief after acknowledging the master with a drop of blood, and regained his appearance of an expert again: "What's your name?"
"Teacher, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it cannot be changed, the girl stopped talking and nodded with a cute face.
"Well, take your ID card and go get your bedding and books, and find your own place by the way! Classes will start tomorrow, just come here and find me!"
Zhang Xuan waved his hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded, turned and left.
"Successfully fooled the last one!"
Seeing her as his student, Zhang Xuan heaved a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It's really not easy. If it weren't for the many pretending skills on the Internet, I'm afraid it would be really difficult to succeed today.
With a student, you can avoid the misfortune of being expelled. Zhang Xuan felt relaxed, and suddenly felt that the whole person's spirit became much smoother in an instant, and the obsession that hovered in his mind from his predecessor was also slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since I become you, I will live a good life for you!"
The previous Zhang Xuan died because he couldn't recruit students. How unwilling, now that there are students, the last persistence disappeared without a trace. Until now, Zhang Xuan has completely mastered this body.
Boom!
Completely controlling his body, Zhang Xuan was about to fool a few more students when he felt a shock in his head, and a voice of Huang Zhong Dalu resounded loudly.
Boom!
All kinds of mysterious words made him dizzy, and then a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big characters shining on it.
Tiandao Library!
Push the door and walk in, there are countless bookshelves, all kinds of books are endless, and there is no end in sight.
"Library? Nima, I was a librarian in my previous life, so I won't be in this world, it's still the same!"
Other people's big gift bags are either Grandpa, or systems, all kinds of awesome good things, but he is a library. Zhang Xuan only felt that his eyes went dark, and he almost fainted.
library? Dry bird? Could it be that in future fights, others throw swords and I throw books?
"See what books are there?"
Feeling helpless, Zhang Xuan stretched out his hand to grab the books on the bookshelf, wanting to see what the library does, but only to find out that the palm of his hand directly passed through the bookshelf, and the grab was empty.
"Are you playing with me? Give me a library, but I can't get any books, I can't read them, what are you going to do?"
Zhang Xuan was speechless, wanting to cry but no tears.
Chapter 1
Why? What about my tattoos!
Zhao Yu rolled up his sleeves and looked at his two white and tender arms in surprise. Before, he had two domineering green dragons tattooed on his arm!
Why...all gone?
Zhao Yu raised his head and found that he was sitting in a glare-lit office with small office partitions on the front, back, left, right sides.
At this moment, the phone kept ringing, paper documents were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were shuttling quickly in the hall, all of them looked overwhelmed.
At this time, a middle-aged man wearing a brown jacket came quickly and greeted everyone, "Leader Qu Ping is now telling everyone about the case of rape with an electric baton, and the operation will start tonight, everyone pay attention! "
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard. The whiteboard was full of words and several photos were pasted on it.
Hearing the greeting, many staff hurriedly gathered around, pulled up chairs casually, sat in front of the whiteboard and listened carefully.
Zhao Yu didn't move, and was still sitting in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in great shock. He touched his right ear, and it turned out to be intact! Before, his right ear was split in half by a gangster during a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to look for a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw the photo on the desk. In the photo, there is a handsome young man in a police uniform who looks exactly like himself!
Grandma a bear! Shocked, strange memories flooded into his mind instantly like the flood of the Yellow River. It was only then that Zhao Yu gradually realized, could it be... that he had encountered the legendary time-traveling!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a gold medal fighter of the Qinglong gang, a ruffian king who fought to his death! Although his real name is Zhao Yu, people in Jianghu prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma a bear!
Zhao Yu was shocked again. He finally remembered that before this, he had already been executed by injecting drugs!
But, thinking and thinking...why did you come here?
Could it be... I have really time-traveled! ?
And it's still seamlessly connected, so there's no need for reincarnation at all?
With the influx of new memories, he was surprised to find that this is a parallel world similar to the one before, and his current identity is an agent of the mobile team of the serious crime team, and he is actually a policeman!
The hall where he is now is not anywhere else, but the office of the police station!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes, the huge contrast was really unimaginable. A senior ruffian turned into an detective of the serious crimes team. How can this be justified?
He touched his head subconsciously. In the past, because his head had been chopped off several times, his hair was always uneven, so he simply had a big bald head, which looked like a sinister spirit. But now, he actually has flowing black hair, and he looks like a handsome young man.
"Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of rape with electric batons in our city..." At this moment, a female detective with short hair and big eyes was telling the story to everyone.
Zhao Yu quickly found the detective's information from his memory. She was the leader of Team B of the Serious Crime Squad. Despite her young age, she had a steady style of work and a high rate of solving cases. She was a celebrity in front of the leader. Generally, if there are any major cases that require the cooperation of the whole team, she will preside over them.
"The victims are all beautifully dressed young women, and they all have bad life style problems." Team leader Qu Ping said, "Most of the incidents occurred near bars, karaoke halls and other risqué places, and the crimes were committed after midnight. "
"According to the victim's statement, the perpetrator first followed the victim into an unmanned alleyway, then stunned him with an electric baton, and then raped him. After committing the crime, the perpetrator would also pee on the victim!"
Hearing the word "pee*pee", the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu took a look. This person was Liu Changhu, the vice-captain of the Mobile Squad of the Serious Crime Squad. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person had many branches of Zhao Yu, and he was asked to deliver letters and pour tea every day, just like ordering his servants.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a ruffian king, but a big boy with a weak personality, who has just finished his internship and turned into a full-time police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many colleagues with senior qualifications would make fun of him and arrange some jobs for him that should not belong to him.
The current Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon, how can he stand being yelled at? He slapped the table and stood up abruptly.
His sudden standing up startled Liu Changhu, and even Team Leader Qu Ping had to pause for a moment.
Unexpectedly, when everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a female voice like a silver bell suddenly jumped ahead of Zhao Yu. I saw a girl with a ponytail, a slightly fat body, and wearing big glasses appeared in front of everyone.
The girl is a new intern clerk assigned by the serious crime team, and her name is Li Beini. This girl is a nymphomaniac, and she fell in love with Zhao Yu in less than a month.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied, he is a good-looking person. He is 1.78 meters tall, looks like a tree, is young and handsome, and has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being yelled at, Li Beini hurried forward to make a rescue: "Captain Liu, I'll come, I'll come! I'm still in the internship period, so of course I will do these jobs!"
After speaking, Li Beini gave Zhao Yu a knowing smile, and ran to the tea room in the lobby to make coffee.
Zhao Yu couldn't get angry either, so he could only sit down patiently and continue to think about his time travel. Although he traveled through time, his memory is very clear, because he was lying on the execution couch just a few minutes ago. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed and did not kill anyone at all! The person who was killed was the boss of a certain real estate group. Zhao Yu just beat him up according to the instructions of his superiors. It was impossible to kill him.
Besides, even if he was beaten to death, it would be manslaughter and should not be convicted of murder! Therefore, his death penalty was all a conspiracy by others!
Thinking of this, Zhao Yu couldn't help being filled with anger, and his fists were clenched loudly. If I can find the person who framed me in the future, I must make them repay double!
At this time, Li Beini had already made the coffee and shared a cup with each of the colleagues present. The little girl's face was always full of enthusiasm, and every time she gave out a cup, she would give a friendly encouragement such as "Thanks for your hard work" and "Come on", which won the favor of colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, there are two packs of sugar in this cup! Tonight is doomed to have a good time, so you have to hold on!"
Before Zhao Yu could react, Li Beini happily put the plate away.
At this time, Team Leader Qu Ping had finished speaking about the case, and Team Leader Jin Zhenbang, the leader of the serious crime team, spoke instead. Captain Jin is over 50 years old, with gray temples, he is an unsmiling and serious old man.
Captain Jin said eloquently, "There have been three cases of electric batons, and one more case will be classified as a serial incident. Not only the top, but we can't bear this big hat!"
Therefore, everyone cheer up and strive to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "In this way... Team A sent people to the scene of the crime to investigate. Since the criminal followed the victim, he must have appeared in the bar and karaoke bar where the victim was before. Pull out all the surveillance cameras there, and we must find this person!"
"yes!"
"Group B, you are mainly responsible for the comparison of evidence!" Captain Jin ordered, "The criminal has no criminal record, and the blood line can't go through. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue. You can go to a hospital or a physical examination center for an examination and comparison. As long as this person has undergone a physical examination or been hospitalized, he will definitely be found!"
"yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal that appeared at the scene, and the only victim who saw the criminal's face, these clues cannot be ignored, and we must send people to follow up on all of them!"
"yes!"
"Okay, each group arranges an action plan. If there is no problem, then set off as soon as possible!" Captain Jin said, closed his folder, and was about to turn around and leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!"
Everyone looked back and found that the person who spoke was none other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also taken aback, and quickly asked, "What's the matter, Zhao Yu? What's your problem?"
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead, and said confidently, "I'm not feeling well, I'm going home first, you guys can play on your own!"
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the office of the president of Donghai Senior Private Hospital.
With a "snap", a thick medical record was slammed onto the table. Dean Lin's face was ashen and furious, "Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group. He owns 40% of our hospital." You must give him priority in detoxification!"
Facing the dean's outrage, Han Yunxi put her hands in the pockets of her white coat and remained calm. "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li has chronic snake venom, and I'm not allowed to jump in line unless it's an emergency."
She looks pure and beautiful, with a pair of big eyes and a pair of small dimples. She is famous in the Chinese medicine circle for her amazing acupuncture talent at a young age. She is a rare expert in detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or human endotoxins. These are her forte.
"You understand, this is Lingyun!" The dean was so angry that he shot the case.
"Enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal before doctors, only men and women. Han Yunxi, let me tell you, arrange for detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today, get out of the medical profession!"
I thought Han Yunxi would be afraid, but she was still calm and serious, "Dean Lin, there is no distinction between men and women in front of me, there are only two kinds of people, those I want to save and those I don't want to save, Mr. Li and I If you don’t want to save it, please ask another wise man!”
After she finished speaking, she smiled politely, turned around and left, her seemingly thin body was elegant and calm, and there was a kind of arrogance in the tranquility and beauty that could not be ignored. However, when Xuan Han Yunxi opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
"Han Yunxi, you dare to speak to me like that, stop!"
As she said that, she casually threw the folder on the table at the back of her head. Han Yunxi was startled, only feeling a hot and humid sensation slowly flowing down from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, Tianning Kingdom.
Han Yunxi woke up in a daze from the sedan chair, and heard the festive surroundings, the sound of suona and gongs and drums coming and going, but her eyes were completely dark.
what happened?
Han Yunxi tore off the thing covering her head and took a look, gasping for air. This... isn't this Xipa? Subconsciously raised her head and then lowered her head, and found that she was wearing a phoenix crown and Xiapei, as if she was a bride just getting married... Drunk!
The bouncing of the sedan chair gave Han Yunxi a headache, and at this time, strange memories flooded into her mind one after another. Undoubtedly, she has time-traveled, and she will marry as soon as she time-travels!
The original owner was the prostitute daughter of the Han family of Tianning Kingdom medical family, also called Han Yunxi, because her biological mother was able to save the queen at that time, who is now the queen mother, and was married to the seven princes at that time, who is now the king of Qin. Long Feiye was a good story at that time, and the Han family's status soared because of it.
But no one knew that Han Yunxi beat her mother to death when she was born, and she grew up to be a good-for-nothing ugly girl who didn't know medical skills. Therefore, the marriage was procrastinated and became a taboo for the King of Qin. According to the paper order, choose a date to get married before the end of the month.
King Long Feiye of Qin became king when he was young. He was the only remaining prince in the battle for the throne. He was only in his early twenties, but in terms of seniority, he was the only uncle of the emperor. He could be said to be the most powerful person in Tianning.
Prince Qin's mansion is in the south of the city, Han's family is in the north of the city, and the sedan chair has to pass through the city from north to south. When King Qin got married, even though he didn't show up, it still attracted thousands of people and caused a sensation in the city.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out the memory information, the joy came to an abrupt end, and Xi Po yelled, "It's not good, it's not good, the big thing is not good!"
Chapter One
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's almost midnight, get up and eat some dumplings."
Feng Yu felt that the voice was a little strange, but at the same time felt very kind. He vaguely agreed, opened his eyes, but saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
"sister?"
"Wake up, hurry up and wash your face. I told you not to drink, you must drink, you fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival Gala." Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Today is New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu glanced around confusedly, and saw a hut with less than six square meters, a single bed, patched quilts, an old wooden table, and a twenty-watt incandescent lamp above the head, emitting There was a dim light, and old newspapers were still pasted on the wall, all of which were important national events that he could no longer remember clearly.
Isn't this the old house on his family's farm when he was a child, but this house has long been demolished with the construction of the small town, and how did my sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to realize that it was definitely not a tricky joke, because his hands became smaller and his arms became thinner.
He jumped off the bed suddenly and stood by the door frame. There were marks on it that he would use a knife to make every New Year's Day. The highest row was in 1988, 166 centimeters.
Is it 1988? He hasn't graduated from junior high school yet?
He pinched himself hard, almost crying out in pain, isn't it a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out, and his mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lives in a hut, the kitchen is just outside the door, and the living room is on the other side of the kitchen, which is called the main house on the farm.
"Wake up, will you still drink in the future?" Zhang Muhua looked at his son lovingly.
Feng Yu looked at his mother who was still full of black hair, his eyes were moist.
"Mom, you have worked hard."
"What are you talking about, kid. Hurry up and wash your face, go inside and watch TV for a while, the dumplings will be ready soon." Zhang Muhua was very relieved when he heard that hard work, his son has grown up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. In the future, when he was just able to make money, his father was found to have a terminal brain tumor and passed away in less than three months, without even spending a penny of the money he earned.
For a long time, Feng Yu was very sad that the son wanted to support him but did not wait for his relatives.
"Dad." Feng Xingtai turned his head to look at his son: "You're up, are you still dizzy? Let's watch some TV. It's a great festival for folk dancers."
"Dad, I want to drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Beer is fine."
I haven't had a few drinks with my dad in my life, Feng Yu now has a strong desire to drink with my dad again.
"I don't have a long memory yet. That's fine. I'll drink a little later. I'll see if you can get up tomorrow to pay New Year's greetings! Danying, go get two bottles of beer."
Feng Danying shook her head helplessly, then turned to get beer and cups.
There is also a single bed in the main room with a futon on it. Feng Danying went to school and lived on campus, and lived in the back room with her mother when she came back from vacation. Feng Xingtai slept in this bed. But three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
There is a vertical wardrobe with three doors on the west wall of the living room, and there are two suitcases on the wardrobe. On a solid wood table, there is a 14-inch black and white TV, and the Spring Festival Gala is playing on the TV.
There is a folding round table in the middle of the living room, which is already full of dishes and bowls and chopsticks. There are eight dishes in total, but all are leftovers from the evening. There are chickens, fish and knuckles. All eight dishes are meat dishes, and none of them are vegetarian dishes.
Feng Yu didn't watch TV, but walked to the front of the closet and took a careful look in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can now be sure that he is reborn!
Mother quickly cooked the dumplings. Feng Yu and Feng Danying went to the kitchen to help serve the dumplings. Feng Xingtai picked up the chopsticks after all four of them sat down.
"Xiao Yu, you're still drinking!" Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, let me drink some more for Chinese New Year."
Feng Xingtai also helped to say a few words, Zhang Muhua shook his head and let them go. Feng Yu also graciously poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister. The whole family must drink a glass.
"Dad, Mom, sister, happy new year, cheers!"
Feng Yu took a casual bite of the leftovers on the table and found them to be extremely delicious. In this day and age, there are no such hormone additives of later generations. Fish and rabbits are all wild, while chickens and pigs are raised by the family. The father and father ate these dishes, just had dumplings, and each drank a bottle of beer. Feng Xingtai would not let more.
After eating, Feng Yu washed up and went back to his hut to lie down. While lying on the bed, he tossed and turned, and couldn't help thinking about his life before he was reborn.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his forties. After resigning from a securities company, he started his own investment life.
He has a wife and no children. His father died of illness when he was young, and his mother lives with him.
He remembered that it was the spring of 2015. In order to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, he wanted to earn more money, so he mortgaged all the family savings, including the house and car, and borrowed a large amount of money. Investing in the stock market, according to his prediction, it is a bull market at this time, and fools can make money.
The situation was very good at the beginning, and his investment quickly doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, hoping to make more profits. If he doubled it again, he would do nothing for the rest of his life, and he would be able to live comfortably.
When the stock market rose to 5,000 points, like many people, he was greedy and thought that it could continue to rise. At first, the stock market did rise a little, but the stock market soon plunged because he used high leverage and had no funds to add more , but lost a lot of money. After repaying the borrowed money, he became destitute. His wife didn't know that the house and car had been mortgaged, so he didn't know how to go home and face his family.
He went bankrupt, drank a lot of alcohol that day, and deliberately fell down on the road under the gaze of many people, and was hit by a big truck.
This should not be considered suicide. The accident insurance he bought should be able to pay several million, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembered that when he looked at the speeding truck, he thought in his heart that if God could give him a chance to do it all over again, he would not die so uselessly, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But unexpectedly, God actually gave him a chance to do it all over again!
Since God asked him to start all over again, the regrets of his previous life will never reappear in this life. He wants to become a rich man, and he wants to become a legend in the investment world!
"Xiaoyu, stop shouting, go to bed quickly."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time, she blamed her husband for letting her son drink alcohol at night. This is all nonsense.
Hearing his mother complaining, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. Chapter One
Monday, May 20, 2019.
End of spring and summer solstice.
In this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan area changes greatly. Wearing shorts during the day becomes a hot dog; at night, you have to curl up in bed and freeze into a cold bird.
Jiangnan University City.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, and the computer desk was pulled to the side of the bed so that he could watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang didn't have a hobby of skipping classes - the weather was sweltering in the middle of the night last night, and in his sleep he resorted to the trick 'Shuanglong Going to Sea' to kick the quilt away.
In the middle of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who only had a pair of underpants all over his body, suddenly felt miserable. In his sleep, he groped hard on the bed with his hands, searching for it, but he couldn't touch the quilt. In the end, it only shrank into a skinny shrimp shape, shivering under the tyrannical power of the midnight cold wind.
When the sun rose, Song Shuhang had already become a member of the seasonal cold army.
The roommate has asked for leave for today's class for him.
Then, he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The high fever subsided, but the body was still a little weak, and it was impossible to go to class in such a state. Therefore, he can only stay in the dormitory alone and watch movies boringly.
On the screen, the progress bar of the movie is slowly advancing. But Song Shuhang didn't see the content of the movie at all.
"Has the effect of the medicine gone yet? I'm so sleepy." He yawned, feeling his eyelids a little heavy.
'Dididi~' At this time, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer jumped.
This is a reminder that someone added him as a friend, or joined a group.
"Who added me?" Song Shuhang murmured, he reached out and tapped on the lower right corner of the computer touch screen, and a notification message popped up.
[Zhenjun Huangshan (******) requests to add you as a friend. ] Additional message: None.
Huangshan True Monarch? Who, such a strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate in the class?" Song Shuhang thought to himself, he couldn't help but think of those guys in the class who had gone to college but were still in the period of youthful fantasy. If it were them, they would indeed have such a strange nickname.
Thinking of this, he clicked 'agree'.
Immediately afterwards, another system message popped up.
[Zhenjun Huangshan invites you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group', do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to press agree.
'Book Mountain is under great pressure' agrees to join the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group'.
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to the group friends! ] also comes with a system smiley face.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang agreed to close the prompts and the group chat window—he was sleepy now, how could he have the energy to care about which groups he joined?
Anyway, his group setting has always been 'not prompting messages, only displaying the number', the chat in the group will not pop up to disturb him, and only the chat number will be displayed after the group.
After he wakes up, he can look through the chat records, and then he will know what group he joined, and the chat records of the members in the group will not be lost.
The progress bar of the movie was still tenaciously moving forward, but Song Shuhang's consciousness became more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 group, after seeing a newcomer join, a diving member appeared in the group. Beihe Loose Cultivator: "Did True Monarch Huangshan add a new fellow Taoist? It's been more than a year since no one has been added, right?"
Another with the ID 'Su Clan's Ah Qi' replied quickly: "Are there any new fellow Taoists? Which district of Huaxia is the fellow Taoist from? Where's the Taoist name? How many levels have you cultivated?"
With this series of questions, I always feel that something is wrong?
"Is it a fairy? If yes, report your measurements and show me a photo!"
"Brother Sanlang, are you really a goldfish?" Northern River Loose Cultivator sighed, "Don't try to kill yourself again, what if the True Monarch of Huangshan adds another senior to come in?"
This guy Sanlang is good at everything, he is affectionate, righteous, and helpful, so he is very popular - but he usually likes to flirt, and he is good at doing things.
However, this guy's lucky value is so low that it is ridiculous. Every time he can't help but die, he always offends the senior. These idle seniors are worried about having no fun, so they are naturally very happy to toss the fun that comes to their door.
"I beg you not to mention the word 'senior', I have a shadow in my heart." Thrice Reckless Mad Saber sent a row of 'tears streaming down his face' emoji.
Four years ago, his bad mouth offended a beautiful 'big senior', and he was tormented miserably... That senior tormented him for a whole year and four months. You heard it right, it is a whole year and four months! Thinking of those inhuman years, his eyes were moist.
As soon as San Lang finished speaking, the group burst into smirks one after another——undisguised, straightforward gloating.
There were eight people in the group whose online status was displayed, and six of them all popped up and swiped a row of smiling faces.
"You guys who gloat, I remember each of you, don't let me meet you, otherwise I will let you experience the experience of my seventy-two-way fast knife!" Mad Saber Three Waves hated road. He is very confident in his sharp knife. None of the six guys who smirked just now are his opponents in a one-on-one match.
Three Waves of the Mad Saber had just finished speaking.
His cultivation is profound, he has reached the stage of the fifth-rank Linghuang, and he is only two steps away from the sixth-rank Lingjun, but he can't beat Ah Qi.
He is fast and ruthless with seventy-two swords in one hand, and he has lightning-fast body skills, but he can't beat Ah Qi.
He is known as the Crazy Saber, and when he gets mad, he is even afraid of himself, but he just can't beat Ah Qi!
When the people in the group saw San Lang wilting, there was another series of unscrupulous smiling faces.
"..." This time, Thrice Reckless Mad Saber could only send out a series of colons depressed.
The people in the group had been making noise for a long time, but they didn't see the newcomer making a sound, so they were a little puzzled.
"The new fellow Taoist is silent?" Beihe Loose Cultivator asked aloud.
Unfortunately, due to the effect of the cold medicine, Song Shuhang had already entered a half-sleep state again.
At this time, Su Clan's Ah Qi happily sent another message: "I checked, and the new Taoist friend is called 'Shushan is under great pressure'. Have you ever heard of a master with this name? This name sounds a bit Like a Confucian walker?
In retrospect, the practitioners of the Confucian sect were better at fighting than those of the Buddhist sect. Not only were their mouths sharp, but their fists were hard enough. And when you are in the mood, you will sing poems boldly to add to the fun, which is very refreshing! I like hitting them the most. "
"Ah Qi, let me tell you, your expectations for new fellow Taoists are always whether you can fight well or not, and whether you enjoy the fight?" Thrice Reckless Mad Saber said with a tearful expression.
"Uh." Su Clan's Seven was a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren smirked and said, "Could it be another 'senior' who doesn't know how to use chat tools?"
When he said this, everyone felt that the scene had a sense of sight?
That's right, almost four years ago, there seemed to be a senior who came out of seclusion after more than a hundred years of seclusion. He also managed to get on the chat software and was added to the group by True Monarch Huangshan. But because he couldn't type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy called Kuang Dao San Lang happily flirted in front of this senior, and asked the senior to report his measurements, send photos, and voice chat.
Then... within a few days, Thrice Reckless Kuang Saber saw this senior with his own eyes. That is a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Afterwards, this beautiful senior tossed and tossed about Kuang Dao San Lang for a full year and four months before leaving contentedly.
At this time, an ID named 'pharmacist' spoke.
Inexplicably short messages with no beginning or end.
Fortunately, the people in the group have long been used to the pharmacist's brief chat habits - he was asking the group leader, where is Huangshan Zhenjun?
The brevity of the speech was not because the pharmacist was noble and arrogant, but because he typed with two fingers plus handwriting, and his speed was extremely slow. When there are many words, it is easy to make mistakes, and it is extremely painful to delete, delete, and write. Therefore, pharmacists are used to speaking as short as possible.
"He went offline immediately after adding people. I heard that his precious big demon dog ran away from home again in anger, and Zhenjun Huangshan went after him again." Beihe Loose Cultivator replied.
"..." Pharmacist.
"Then we can only chat after the new fellow daoist learns to use the chat tool."
They all preconceived that the newcomers were also like-minded.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang woke up slightly.
"Remember someone added my group just now, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No. 1 Group?" He murmured in a low voice, casually clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the chat window of Jiuzhou No. 1 Group.
What kind of group is it?
Soon, the chat history from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably visited it once.
This seat? Hunting down the big demon dog?
Special vocabulary in various fairy tales.
The way people chat and speak in the group is also very interesting-half old but not ancient, half white and half white. It gives people the feeling that modern people try to communicate in ancient Chinese, but because of their poor foundation in ancient Chinese, the way of communication is very awkward.
"Chi~~" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
It seems that this is a group created by Xianxia enthusiasts?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of Xianxia enthusiasts!
Everyone in the group has a Taoist name for themselves, the place they live in is called Dongfu, and the lost pet dog of the group owner is described as the family's big demon dog who ran away from home. There are also people who claim to have never beaten Confucian practitioners for hundreds of years, that is to say, that person claims to have lived for hundreds of years?
Just looking at these chat records makes me feel ashamed.
"This kind of obsession has already reached the level of the second-year illness, and it is a fairy-xia second-year with Chinese characteristics." Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
From the looks of it, this is a concentration camp for the immortal chivalrous patients!
This was his first impression of the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group' and its members.
But why would you add him to the group?
He looked at the profile of the leader of the group, Huangshan Zhenjun. He was not his classmate, and he certainly didn't know him.
A thin blue line flows smoothly from the nib. The light blue lines on the palm-sized card kept increasing, and gradually, a complicated and mysterious pattern became more and more perfect with the sliding of the pen tip.
Suddenly the tip of the pen paused heavily, changing from the lightness just now, and then suddenly hooked sideways, the pen hook was like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly dimmed and returned to normal.
After completing this card, his face was still as focused as before. He has only completed fifteen cards now, and there is still a difference of ten cards from today's task. What he is currently producing is a one-star energy card. As the lowest energy card, it is currently the most widely used and one of the most consumed cards.
At this moment, the room was suddenly dark.
The number one hundred was displayed on the instrument. I didn't expect the energy to be used up. It seems that I have to add another one to today's task. After returning to the desk, Chen Muxun devoted himself to his work. All his sources of income rely on this most paper-grade card.
Chen Mu's room was very small, less than forty square meters, and there was a semi-old work table inside. Except for the relatively clean work table, there are mountains of sundries piled up everywhere in the room. These sundries are also varied, piles of old books, and various raw materials scattered around.
In this simple place, Chen Mu lived for three years. This is a relief room specially provided by the federal government. For a small room like this, you only need to pay one hundred and fifty Odi per month to live in it. For poor people like Chen Mu, there is really no place cheaper than here.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally finished today's work - twenty-five energy cards. He counted the number of cards carefully, and counted twice in a row. After confirming that the number was correct, he carefully put the energy cards into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted him, "Ah Mu is here!"
He replied to the shopkeeper. The owner, Uncle Hua, is an old man in his fifties, and the years have left undisguised marks on him. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card pack from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five cards."
Uncle Hua took the card from Chen Mu's hand, put it on the shelf without looking at it, and said with a smile, "It's a good thing you have A Mu, you send the card every day, otherwise my supply would be short."
Chen Mu smiled slightly, but didn't answer. He knew that Uncle Hua's words were probably meant as a joke. The one-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards. What's more, it is located near the East Wei Academy. How can it only sell 25 energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Mu's temper, so he didn't talk nonsense, and asked directly: "Does Ah Mu need cash or a transfer?"
Chen Mu replied bluntly, and after speaking, he handed a light green card that had been prepared to Uncle Hua. After finishing the settlement, Chen Mu said goodbye to Uncle Hua and turned to leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Mu: "Ah Mu, wait a minute."
Chen Mu stopped, turned around and looked at Uncle Hua in surprise: "Is there anything else? Uncle Hua."
Uncle Hua took out a piece of light yellow paper from the drawer and looked at Chen Mu with a smile: "I almost forgot something. This is a card maker training class certificate. It was purchased by the dealer yesterday." Attached."
Looking at Uncle Hua with a kind face, Chen Mu couldn't help being moved. He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him all these years. If it wasn't for him, Chen Mu believed that the current life would also be out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned how to make energy cards and sold them everywhere, but few people cared about them, and no merchants were willing to buy them. The quantity needed for a one-star energy card is very large, and merchants are more willing to purchase in large quantities at one time. And Chen Mu can only make thirty sheets a day at most. For the merchants, this is just a small amount that doesn't even count as a fraction.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price for each card was 103 oudies, which was 2 oudies lower than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. Even so, Chen Mu was still extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of 103 Audi is lower than the batch price of 105, Chen Mu feels that he is surrounded by great joy. I sold all the energy cards in my hand, bought the cheapest food, and bought the raw materials for the energy cards with the rest of the money.
Since then, Chen Mu's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, he didn't stop for a day.
This is three years. In the past three years, he only made one kind of card—one-star energy card. When he was not making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at 95 Odie, and he could make a profit of 8 Odie from each energy card, and his daily income was stable at 200 Odie. Totally unimaginable numbers.
Chen Mu, who came back to his senses, smiled at Uncle Hua: "Thank you, Uncle Hua!" He took the class certificate and carefully put it into the card case in his arms.
They often have extremely gorgeous advertisements. For example, this class certificate says something like "Dongwei Academy recognizes academic qualifications" and "Dongwei Academy's senior card maker authoritative lecture". In fact, what is in it is Chen Mu. Chu. The only relationship between the institution hosting this training course and Dongwei Academy is that this institution has to pay Dongwei Academy a fee every time as the price for them to maintain this nominal "joint organization".
Chen Mu still planned to listen to what was said in the training class. Card making is one of the most difficult subjects. Over the years, he has not given up on self-study, but with little success. It wasn't until last year that he realized what was going on.
For a young man without the slightest foundation, it is naturally even more difficult to teach himself the difficult and obscure art of card making. However, he didn't have the slightest doubt about his IQ. He could learn to make a one-star energy card within a week just by relying on his memory. The card maker back then praised his talent.
Since then, he has dropped this temporarily too high goal for him, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical study. No matter how tired he is at work every day, he will spare time to learn these boring knowledge.
After bidding farewell to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along an alley. Today is Saturday, and he still has a job.
After crossing two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he came to a second-hand waste card collection station.
He is also the owner of this buying station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Mu would come here to do a three-hour part-time job.
Chen Mu nodded slightly towards Xiao Hei, but there was still a bit of numbness on his face.
Xiao Hei has long been accustomed to Chen Mu's face. When Chen Mu came here and asked for a part-time job, Xiao Hei originally refused. This purchasing station has been managed by one person since his father, and it has been managed by himself all the time when it is in his hands.
But when Chen Mu said that he didn't want wages, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu is still paid. Normally, Chen Mu would choose a few used cards and take them away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen Mu would pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste piles, and Xiao Hei made a calculation. Every month, he saved a lot of money on these. It's just that for the taciturn Chen Mu, he couldn't help being a little curious. How does this guy know that these cards still have energy left?
But since then, every time he sees Chen Mu, he always smiles.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to sort the stacked waste cards. There are many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, quasi-physical cards, and even some rare plant cards and animal cards. But the cards here are all useless without exception. What Chen Mu has to do is to classify these cards.
The work went on quickly, and it was obvious that he knew the job very well.
Chen Mu flipped his wrist, and threw a card towards Xiao Hei: "Here, this card can still be used for a while." This two-star energy card still has at least half of the energy in it. Why would the original owner of the card be so wasteful. The capacity of the two-star energy card is one thousand, that is to say, there are almost five hundred energy in it.
Xiao Hei smiled as he looked at the two-star energy card in his hand. Pidianpidian ran to the energy meter and inserted the card in. When he saw the number "523" lit up on it, Xiao Hei laughed until his facial features were almost huddled together.
The three-year production career has given him his own understanding of the most common and low-level cards. There is not only one way to make one-star energy cards, Chen Mu has already collected twelve kinds of one-star energy cards with different structures from this method.
Chen Mu was greatly inspired by these one-star energy cards with different structures. It was because he borrowed some skills from these cards that he managed to reduce the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five Odie. But such good luck doesn't happen every day, so far, he has only collected twelve.
But luck seems to be good today.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, judging from the texture on the surface, it is a one-star energy card with a new structure that Chen Mu has never encountered.
He put the energy card aside and continued to dig through it. There are too many one-star energy cards, but Chen Mu took the trouble to check them one by one. His speed is extremely fast, almost as long as his hand gently strokes these one-star energy cards, he can know whether it is what he wants.
All of this stems from his familiarity with the one-star energy card. This kind of familiarity was left over from three years of uninterrupted production. He didn't need to look at it, but he could judge whether this card was a one-star energy card or not, and whether it was a structure he had seen before. He is so familiar with them, down to their every detail.
The fingers that brushed the edge of the card stopped suddenly.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was so dizzy that it didn't seem to be her own, the luxurious bed sheet she touched was not the old one she used to wash, and the lamp above her head was not the half-broken one she was used to seeing. In the shape of an energy-saving lamp, her body was in pain as if she had just been torn apart by something. When she raised her wrist, the bruises and purple marks on it were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to let herself scream out. She lifted the quilt and saw herself naked inside, screaming almost out of her throat.
Lin Che's nimble eyes rolled around twice, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed, packed the messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out without looking back.
"Ah...let go of me, you let go..." Lin Che struggled with hands and feet.
The man's big hand grabbed her neck, dragging her back to the bed without any effort.
His deep eyes seemed to be filled with an innate arrogance. On his cold cheeks, the wings of his nose stood high on his fair face, and his skin was as white as jade. She, a woman who thought she had pretty good skin, couldn't help it. Feel envious.
She asked herself that she had met a lot of men, but those men who were called male gods suddenly became eclipsed in front of him.
Is this the man who spent half the night yesterday, torturing her half to death?
"Who sent you? You actually drugged me? You did such a thing, thinking you could leave here intact?" He looked at the dazed woman, and anger flashed in his deep eyes.
This strange woman had snowy skin, a pleasant face, a pair of big smart eyes with fluttering eyelashes, like a frightened deer, and stared at him with wide open eyes not to be outdone.
Gu Jingze fixed his eyes on her, and saw Lin Che's eyes moving quickly with his brain again.
However, she was lost in the wrong person.
Although the person in front of him was so handsome that it made people feel dizzy, he was obviously not that super star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was rudely grabbed by his arm again, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in embarrassment before she stopped again.
"Did you make a mistake? I am the one who is seriously damaged now." Her butt hurts from falling, her hand hurts, and the pain below her can't be ignored. When she got annoyed, she yelled directly, "I'm going to be fascinated It's someone else, it has nothing to do with you, you think you are worthy of my drug, my aunt didn't do it casually, you pay me back for the drug!"
Lost in the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tense, his eyebrows were twisted into the word Sichuan, and his dark eyes were like dormant beasts, staring at this disheveled woman. Half of her white shoulders were exposed, and the bruise and red marks on it were clear and eye-catching. On the white and tender skin, it seems that plum blossoms are blooming.
Those images of the night flashed into his mind again, his lower abdomen suddenly felt hot, and he felt the obvious heat surging in his body again.
Look away from her face.
This damned woman dared to drug him, and the effect was so strong.
His momentary opening gave Lin Che the chance to jump off the bed recklessly, and she pushed the man away forcefully.
Not daring to turn her head back, she hurried out.
Hearing his hiss, she yelled, "What are you looking at, go and see for yourself!"
"You..." Just as Gu Jingze was about to turn around and grab her, he felt his body unbearable for a while, and the lower part had already become uncontrollably high again.
"Damn it." He cursed loudly, clenched his fists to suppress that damned desire.
A series of voices came from outside.
Qin Hao looked back, unable to close his mouth in astonishment.
What happened just now? Why did a disheveled woman come out of Mr.'s room?
He raised his sharp eyes, and the black pupils were shining brightly, making Qin Hao quickly swallow all the doubts he shouldn't have into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept washing his body in the bathroom until the skin on his body was washed pink, then he cursed in the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze was taken aback for a moment. At this time, his mother actually came over, and he knew it would not be a good thing after thinking about it.
When the bathroom door was opened, the beautiful lady standing outside was looking at the mess on the bed in surprise.
Those beds that hadn't been made in time were clearly telling everyone in front of them what happened last night.
Gu Jingze's black eyes were gloomy, and he pulled the bathrobe over the honey-colored shoulders with one hand, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm very busy today."
How could Mu Wanqing not ask, the excitement on her face couldn't be concealed, looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know that you had sex with a girl."
Gu Jingze pushed open the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "Can you leave this matter alone?"
"How can I ignore it, Jingze, you have to marry her, and you have to take responsibility for other girls."
"Mother, I won't marry her. I'm not crazy. She's just a strange woman. I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more perturbed because he thought of that woman.
"Are you still thinking about that Mo Huiling? Let me tell you, it is impossible for you to be with her. You have been with her for so many years, but you still can't touch her. You are simply destined not to be together!" Mu Wanqing Say it bluntly.
"Mother, that's enough!" Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, and the family is almost ready for artificial insemination so that you can have a child, but you met a woman today, which means that she is The best match for you!"
Qingcheng, a famous Taoist mountain, has been visited by countless strange people since ancient times. The so-called dragon and snake hidden in the grass is just like this.
Countless myths and legends, countless legendary stories, like a thick cloud, cast a mysterious veil on Qingcheng.
The morning light was slightly dew, and on the stone path in the mountain, groups of Taoists in Tsing Yi held three long incense sticks, quietly and quickly marched on the path, towards a towering, smooth mirror-like stone wall in the back mountain.
The mountain road is steep and slippery with dew, but these Taoists are faster than galloping horses, bringing up strips of green shadows. Some even jumped up from time to time, Ling Feng flew across a distance of 100 meters, the morning wind blew, and their clothes fluttered, and the fluttering momentum was like a fairy coming to the mortal world.
Among the mountains, peaks, and various palaces and pavilions of Qingcheng Mountain, there are Taoist priests constantly walking out and gathering in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there are also a large group of young Taoist priests, holding various flags, ritual instruments, and incense burners, walking around the Nine Palaces formation. The cigarette shot straight into the sky, and the dense air wound up, turning into a cloud and covering the heads of the group.
In the front of many Taoists, just under the stone wall, a group of Taoist priests wearing gold-rimmed purple Taoist robes, with gossip patterns embroidered with silver thread on the chest and back, and clouds and grass patterns on the sleeves of the robes. Holding a whisk in his hand, he stood there expressionlessly.
The group of Taoists waited quietly for a while, when a red light suddenly jumped up in the east, and the misty red light instantly tore apart the sky and the earth and scattered all over the place, all the Taoists kowtowed down together, and walked reverently towards the stone wall. Great gift.
Thousands of Taoists recited mantras at the same time, and the "buzzing, buzzing" mantras were entangled together and turned into a trembling sound that spread far away. Gradually, a strange power rose from the sound of the incantation, and a bright and colorful glow shot out from the heads of many Taoists, shining on the smooth and clean stone wall.
Those Taoists in gold-rimmed purple robes kowtowed to the ground at the same time, murmuring a prayer.
This continued for half an hour, and finally a ray of white light shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall emitted a clear white light.
The haze rose to the sky, and there were countless clouds and smoke entangled in the stone wall, and a few hazy figures with golden light around their bodies appeared in the clouds and smoke. The figures became clearer and clearer, and finally three men, two women, and five Taoists in white Taoist robes, whose faces were obscured by the golden light, appeared in front of everyone.
The woman in the center lowered her head and glanced at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, suddenly a scroll was added to her hand, and she threw it out casually.
There was a flash of white light on the stone wall, and the scroll woven with purple jade and gold thread slowly floated out, and it happened to land on the hands of the old Taoist in purple robe who led many Taoists to worship at the front. The woman who threw out the scroll murmured a few words, turned around and left with her companions.
Several old Taoists in purple robes suddenly shouted: "Patriarch, be merciful, be merciful!"
The sound of "dong dong" kept ringing, and all the Taoists kowtowed heavily to the five men and women in salute, knocking their foreheads so loudly that the mountains and rocks rang.
The woman who threw out the scroll snorted coldly, and immediately all the Taoists fell to their knees stiffly, not daring to make any more movements.
On the other hand, the other woman next to the woman laughed in a low voice, and threw a few things with her backhand.
The light on the stone wall dimmed, and the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several objects shining with strange light slowly fell from the air, including a sword, a bead, a small cauldron, five talismans and nine medicine bottles.
The sword, beads, and small tripod are small in size, like children's playthings, but each one is wrapped in dazzling haze, obviously extraordinary.
The five talismans are entwined with golden light and the purple energy is compelling. Wave after wave of indistinct pressure gushes out from the talismans. Back off.
The nine medicine bottles are densely engraved with talismans and seals of various colors. The old Taoist who just took the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists, and a quiet medicine box gushed out immediately. Thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, feeling that the seven orifices were unblocked, and the meridians all over the body As if washed by clean water, the whole body brightened up.
Just smelling a ray of medicinal fragrance is better than the three months of hard work of these Taoists. The Zipao old man hastily sealed the medicine bottle tightly. Just the fragrance from the elixir has such a miraculous effect, one can imagine what kind of treasure the elixir in this medicine bottle is.
Several old Taoists in purple robes gathered together and murmured for a while, then packed up the sword, beads, tripod, talisman and medicine bottle respectively, and then unfolded the scroll in front of all the Taoists.
The first half of the scroll is the "Tai Xu Qi Jing", a scripture for training Qi and nourishing the mind. As for the second half of the scroll, the faces of the purple-robed old Taoists paled, and they all shouted in panic. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists in Qingcheng Mountain swarmed out.
Qingcheng Mountain's latent power in the secular world was fully activated, setting off an invisible huge wave.
Chapter 1
In the scorching heat of July, the Asphalt Road exudes a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, and looks like it is about to melt.
The sky above the road was directly distorted and skewed by the transpiration of air.
Under such a poisonous sun, there are hardly any pedestrians on the street, and even few cars pass by. Everyone is looking for a shady place to escape the heat, or enjoys happiness in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a washed white shirt and gray suit pants hurriedly walked towards the Second People's Hospital.
The hair was tightly stuck to the woman's face due to sweat, and the woman's cheeks were abnormally flushed, which was obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet from the sweat on his body, and it felt uncomfortable to stick to his body. However, Qiao Nan had no time to take care of it, and he grabbed the bag with 100,000 yuan in it.
This is the money she managed to get by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needs 200,000 yuan for the operation, and there is still 100,000 yuan left to find a way.
Walking straight towards the ward, Qiao Nan's hand touched the door guard, and he heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault. If it wasn't for her, Da Jun wouldn't have divorced me." This was the voice of Qiao Nan's sister, Qiao Zijin.
"Don't cry, Mom has already taught Qiao Nan a lesson for you." Ding Jiayi, the mother, patted her eldest daughter's head in distress.
Qiao Nan, who was standing outside, was stunned. It wasn't because her sister was caught by Chen Jun that she cheated, so Chen Jun would leave with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan felt sad.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Zijin was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan severely, saying that Qiao Nan had hidden evil intentions, and that he was a heartless little bastard who wanted to steal her boyfriend from her sister. She said that she would force her own sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had no choice but to quit, to fulfill Chen Jun and his sister.
"Mom, Dajun divorced me, the child is not with me, and I have this disease again, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't been filial to you yet, I really don't want to die."
In the ward, Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi and cried hard. She is still so young and still has a lot of good days. She really doesn't want to die.
Ding Jiayi was very moved when she heard that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness and thought about being filial to herself in the future.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Zijin on the back: "No, Mom will definitely not let you have trouble. Mom has already raised money for you because of that dead girl Qiao Nan."
Not long after Qiao Zijin divorced Chen Jun, she suffered from kidney failure and had to have a kidney transplant immediately.
But in this marriage, Qiao Zijin cheated on the wrong party, and Chen Jun worked for the government, Qiao Zijin was exiled from the house, and now she is sick and has no money for medical treatment and medicine.
Qiao Nan, who had known for a long time that his mother was eccentric, couldn't help ache in his already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She is already forty years old. After breaking up with Chen Jun that year, she has never been in love again. It's not that she doesn't want to, but her mother doesn't want to.
Over the years, most of the money she earned has been given to her mother. Her mother used the money she earned to buy her sister a suite of 150 square meters, but she can only live in a house with only a few dozen square meters. in the rental room.
She paid for food and even utility bills at her parents' house. Every time her sister went back to her mother's house, although she had some things in her hand when she came, she carried more when she went back.
I am unmarried at this age, and I am joked that no one wants leftover women. Qiao Nan is not unaware that her mother does not want her to get married, but only wants her salary.
But this is her own mother. Every time she goes on a blind date and falls in love, her mother will make a fuss and seek life. She can't help it.
I have worked so hard over the years, but in the end I only got the words "dead girl", especially when Qiao Zijin pushed all the responsibility for her cheating and divorce on herself. Grabbing the 100,000 yuan in her hand, Qiao Nan suddenly didn't want to give it to Qiao Zijin.
Before Qiao Nan left, the next conversation Qiao Nan heard really chilled and despaired Qiao Nan.
What if Qiao Nan raised 200,000 yuan but couldn't find the money? In fact, the doctor said that if a relative is willing to donate a kidney to me, the degree of matching will be higher and rejection will not easily occur. "
Leaning in Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Zijin said pitifully: "If you really have relatives, maybe I can save a little money for medical treatment."
**How can it be so easy to find, some people can't wait for such an opportunity until they die!
Knowing this, Qiao Zijin knew that money alone was not enough for her to survive, she had to think of other ways.
"Why don't mom go for a blood test?" Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Zijin shook her head repeatedly. Her mother is at this age, and her kidneys are definitely not much better than hers. Now that she has all of them, she must want a good one: "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me. I can't bear it." If you use a knife, my dad will definitely not do it."
"Then..." Ding Jiayi thought for a while, and her eyes lit up: "Wait a minute when the dead girl comes, I'll let her go for a blood test, she's your own sister, she's definitely a match!"
"That's good, but will Qiao Nan not agree? After all, this is a kidney." Qiao Zijin's eyes were full of calculations.
In order to survive, and just in case, she would never allow Qiao Nan to refuse.
"Miss Qiao, come and see your sister, why don't you go in?" Qiao Zijin chatted with Ding Jiayi, when a nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Zijin's face changed drastically: "Mom..." All the conversations she had with her mother just now were heard by {that dead girl Qiao Nan?
Without further ado, Ding Jiayi got up and chased after him. Sure enough, she saw Qiao Nan's back, and then shouted Qiao Nan's name.
When Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's shout, she refused to turn her head or stop. Tears kept falling, but her heart was broken into pieces.
For her mother, her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister, it's not enough to calculate her money, and now she still wants her kidney.
Ding Jiayi didn't understand Qiao Zijin's words, but Qiao Nan did. The more this happened, the more Qiao Nan hated her. Even if she really owed the Qiao family, it should be enough!
Qiao Nan had a headache and was about to tell her mother that it was dangerous on the street when a car rushed towards her.
"Squeak", "bang", two loud bangs, Qiao Nan was so painful that he couldn't speak, but he managed to open his eyes to see how her mother was doing.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened. Seeing her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and murmured: "Qiao Nan, it's good for you to die, at least you can help me when you die. Thanks to your sister. Zijin has a kidney and money!"
The youngest daughter was killed, and the person who hit the youngest daughter must lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan glared and stared at Ding Jiayi intently. Before the ambulance personnel arrived, she couldn't bear to be pissed off by Ding Jiayi!
Chapter 1
The most frustrating thing in the world is that one moment you are dreaming of heaven, and the next moment you find yourself in hell.
Mo Wen is such a person. Two months ago, he was still sitting in the classroom, dreaming of being admitted to a key university that he liked, but now he was doing small labor on the construction site exposed to the scorching sun.
Thinking of his tragic experience, Mo Wen spat hard on the ground, raised his hand and wiped the sweat that was dripping from his face indiscriminately. I just finished moving a cart of bricks, and I am already sweating profusely.
Mo Wen, a boy of seventeen or eighteen years old, with an ordinary face, dark skin, lean figure, and a pair of calm eyes. Maybe the child from a poor family is in charge of the family early, and he looks a little mature at such a young age.
Putting the cement truck carrying bricks to the side of the road, Mo Wen found a shady place and sat down. The foreman was not around at this time, so it was a good time to be lazy. On a boring and busy construction site, it is very happy to be lazy for a while.
He was sitting on a concrete slab with a big horse, and his eyes were constantly patrolling the road. After a while, his eyes lit up; a graceful figure walked out from across the road, which immediately attracted his attention.
Although the distance is far away, the other person's appearance cannot be seen, but the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look at it as just a woman walking, but there is a lot of knowledge in it. And Mo Wen stayed on the construction site all day, facing the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to think of something, and pulled out a blue metal disc from the clothes on his chest, only the size of a coin, tied with a small blue iron chain, like a strange necklace.
This is something that Mo Wen accidentally discovered when he was demolishing an old house a few days ago. At that time, he found an old blue brick in a wall. .
If it is another hundred-year-old antique, it may still be worth a little money, but a blue brick, even if it is an antique, may not be worth much at all.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the blue brick on the ground, but he didn't want the blue brick to break from it, and a piece of metal jewelry fell out from it, which was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The cyan metal disk is a bit strange, it is divided into eight areas from the surface of the disk, and all kinds of strange runes are engraved on it.
Mo Wen was not familiar with ancient relics, but he could tell that the thing in his hand should be a miniature version of the eight trigrams plate. Ordinary people would hang the eight trigrams plate at home to seek good luck and avoid evil, and enshrine it as a magic weapon.
Although he is not superstitious, he does not believe that the gossip plate has the ability to seek good fortune and avoid evil, but he also knows that this kind of ancient gossip plate should be valuable, and it may be an antique. If it is sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to be sold overnight Get rich.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing, stroking the gossip necklace was like stroking his lover. Once he became a rich man, those big beauties who only dared to peep from a distance and swallow their saliva secretly were not allowed to be picked by him.
"Something happened. Something happened!"
"Something's wrong! Call an ambulance."
A burst of loud shouts sounded from not far away, and then many people ran to that place, and the shouts also interrupted Mo Wen's dream.
He looked over there suspiciously, hesitated for a moment, stood up anyway, and ran to the place where the crowd gathered over there.
With a glance, he jumped at the situation in front of him. A middle-aged man who was nearly fifty years old and dressed in rags was lying on the ground twitching constantly, his face was pale, he was breathing heavily, and his hands were tightly clutching his chest, as if he was in great pain.
From his eyes, filled with deep fear, he seemed to feel death.
Many workers came, but no one dared to step forward. A group of uneducated workers obviously didn't know what was going on, so they didn't dare to take action rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Wen's complexion changed slightly, and he looked at the twitching old Zhang on the ground with some ugly eyes. He recognized Lao Zhang's illness at a glance, because someone in the village had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes. He witnessed the whole process with his own eyes.
The village he lives in is very remote, and there are basically no professional doctors in the village. Usually, when he gets sick, he is treated simply with earthen prescriptions handed down from his ancestors, and there is no targeted treatment at all.
However, his mother was frail and sick from overwork, and there was no doctor in the village. His biggest dream was to be admitted to the most famous medical university in China, and to become a doctor in the future to treat his mother and the villagers.
It's a pity that he failed the college entrance examination. Originally, with his score, he could be admitted to the medical department of Huaxia University, and he could obtain the qualification for free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son of a family. He squeezed down.
Although he can still be admitted to other good schools with his grades, the high tuition fees are beyond his reach. In order not to burden his mother, he can only give up his studies and start working part-time to earn money.
The construction site belongs to the fringe development zone of the city, which is far away from the urban area. It takes 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at the nearest hospital. But depending on the appearance of the patient, whether he can persist for 25 minutes is still a matter of two talks. Hold on for 25 minutes? That was nothing short of a miracle!
He knows this person, lives in the same work shed with him, his name is Zhang Laoshi, everyone usually calls him Lao Zhang, he is an honest and honest person, because he has no skills, he can only work as the most low-level worker on the construction site like him.
It is said that he also has a son who is going to college, and he worked so hard to make money to support his son to go to college.
Mo Wen looked hesitantly at Lao Zhang, a worker on the ground. His dream is to become a doctor, and he has a certain understanding of some simple and common diseases and pathologies. For acute myocardial infarction, he knows that there are several first-aid measures that can alleviate the condition.
But these days, who dares to save people casually? It is a good thing to be able to save a good person, but if the patient cannot be saved, and the patient has something wrong, the responsibility may be pinned on him.
However, the society is so realistic. Perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the illness and prolong the death time can save a life. But Mo Wen, like everyone else around him, did not dare to rush forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was silent for a while, finally heaved a sigh, and walked towards Lao Zhang who was ill. He is not a bad person, but Lao Zhang has a good relationship with him. They are all poor rural people who come out to work, and they deeply understand each other's difficulties. Lao Zhang is the pillar of the whole family. Watching Lao Zhang die helplessly, his conscience can't do it.
"Don't touch him, I'm a doctor."
A graceful figure came running from a distance, passed through the messy construction site, and trotted to the scene of the incident.
Mo Wen was taken aback for a moment, then subconsciously stopped, a gust of fragrant wind blew in, and there was a graceful figure in front of him.
It was a girl with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She was wearing an off-white floral skirt, and the skirt fell to the bend of her legs, revealing a pair of slender and fair calves. Running all the way, the dress is fluttering, very charming.
Mo Wen couldn't help but stare blankly, he squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but this was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl! A beautiful, natural face without embellishments kept reverberating in his mind! No makeup, yet stunning.
He discovered that the girl in the white dress was exactly the woman whose figure he had secretly lusted after across the road before. Only now do I know that not only is she in good shape, but her face is also surprisingly beautiful.
The girl ignored Mo Wen, and directly knelt down to check on Lao Zhang's condition, and soon her beautiful face changed, as if the situation was a bit serious.
Mo Wen also knew that the patient was in shock at this time, and the situation was not optimistic.
"Can you help me?"
The girl raised her head and looked at Mo Wen anxiously. At this moment, Mo Wen was the closest to the patient, so naturally he was the first to find him.
"sure!"
Mo Wen was taken aback for a moment, he didn't expect the girl to ask him for help, but he quickly came to his senses and hurried to the girl's side.
"Can you help me straighten his body and raise his legs slightly?" the girl asked Mo while carefully performing chest compression surgery on Lao Zhang.
Mo Wenben knew some ways to relieve myocardial infarction, and soon followed what the girl said. He knew that the method the girl said was correct. Lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the brain hypoxia of the shocking patient. Now that there is no equipment such as oxygen tanks, doing so is the best solution.
He suddenly found that his chest was burning hot, and it was getting hotter and hotter. It seemed that there was a red-hot iron sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest, and found that it was the gossip plate unearthed from the ancient blue bricks.
An Lin stood on the top of the tall building, facing the noisy wind.
The wind was howling, and the weightlessness of the sharp fall made him scream in fright even though he was hopeless. "Help!!!!!"
The fear of imminent death enveloped his whole body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, An Lin's whole body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light ball.
The terrible feeling of overweight also came at this moment, he felt like he was riding a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then circled an arc, and flew into the sky.
An Lin's screams continued. After his body flew into the sky, he landed on the roof of the building again.
The incomparably severe overweight and weightlessness, as well as the feeling of alternation between life and death, made An Lin feel dizzy for a while, and then vomited out of breath.
"Hey, boy, are you feeling better?" Just then, an ethereal voice reached An Lin's ears.
He looked up and found an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man's beard and hair are all white, with a fairy-like demeanor, and his whole body is surrounded by golden fairy energy.
Seeing this scene, An Lin's whole body was shocked, and countless plots rushed into his mind.
All kinds of plots began to appear in An Lin's mind, the beginning of all the dreams, isn't this scene in front of you!
Plop!
An Lin kowtowed heavily, tears filled his eyes and said, "Immortal, thank you for saving me!"
The old man who was called an immortal by An Lin caressed his white beard and said with a slight smile, "Young man, you are in your prime, why did you choose to commit suicide?"
"My mother died young, and my father was addicted to gambling." "After my father gambled away the house, he owed millions of gambling debts and was unable to repay, and then ran away alone!"
"Millions! What can I pay back?"
"Afterwards I was forced to drop out of school to work as a coolie for my creditors."
An Lin poured out his nose and tears, feeling that his life was gloomy. What is the difference between a life of paying off debts all your life and a salted fish? It is better to reincarnate early.
After the immortal heard An Lin's experience, he also had a look of sympathy in his eyes, and he slowly said: "Young man, your life is really hard... Let's see, you and I are destined to meet each other, and I think you are extremely talented. Why don't I let Benxian give you a 'system' to change your life."
An Lin trembled when he heard the words. He thought it would be a great fortune to form a relationship with the immortal, but he didn't expect the immortal to be so generous, to give away the system as soon as they met!
"Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..."
The immortal smiled lovingly, with his palm facing the sky, and then a pure white ball of light appeared in his palm.
"Young man, come here and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand." The immortal said to An Lin.
Hearing this, An Lin was so excited that he couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
In his hands, the ball of light radiated a trace of warmth, and the light emitted from the ball was extremely soft.
"Start the system transfer." The immortal said slowly.
As soon as the fairy's words fell, the light on the white light ball flourished!
At this moment, the immortal said to An Lin: "Young man, you swear quickly, swear to accept this God of War system, and never leave it for the rest of your life!"
Ares system?
What a domineering name!
But how does this vow look like a marriage declaration?
Before he had time to think about it, An Lin hurriedly said: "I swear, accept the God of War system and never leave it for the rest of my life!"
As soon as An Lin's oath was finished, the ball of light slammed into his body with a whoosh, and merged with him.
Immediately afterwards, a voice sounded in his mind: "It is detected that the host has the physique of Tian Ming Dao, and meets the qualifications, and the system begins to integrate!"
An Lin was very excited, so excited that he wanted to cry.
I originally thought my life was gloomy, but I didn't expect that at this moment, I would usher in a life of cheating the system!
The immortal was also very excited, and was so excited that he was already crying!
"Grandpa Immortal, what's the matter with you, are you alright?" Seeing the old man's strange behavior, An Lin asked curiously.
The immortal came back to his senses, wiped his tears, and knew that he had lost his composure.
"Young man, after you get the system, you have to work hard." Xianren said earnestly.
"Yes! I will!" An Lin nodded heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school to practice immortality?" The immortal then asked.
Go to school to practice immortality? Only a fool would refuse!
"I want to, I really want to cultivate immortals!"
An Lin almost didn't think about it, so he answered. The immortal smiled in relief, took out a piece of golden paper and handed it to An Lin, and said, "This is my letter of recommendation. With it, you can go to the United University of Immortal Cultivation to study, and officially embark on the road of cultivating immortals."
An Lin was startled, he dared to love Long Aotian's path of cultivating immortals, the immortals have paved it for himself!
He solemnly accepted the recommendation letter from the immortal, and looked at the immortal with gratitude.
An Lin was very curious about this immortal who gave him a new life.
"The name...let's not say it." The immortal stroked the top of An Lin's head with a sympathetic look on his face.
"I have to go, bye, lad."
The immortal bid farewell to An Lin, and then left in the clouds and fog.
"Immortal, go slowly!" An Lin thanked the immortal who flew into the sky.
The fairy's laughter came from the sky, the laughter was extremely carefree and wanton, as if pouring out the injustice of a lifetime.
Why is this immortal so happy? Why does he feel happier than me?
An Lin looked puzzled.
At this moment, a female voice sounded in An Lin's consciousness: "Hello."
This female voice was beautiful, like the sound of heaven, and it made An Lin feel alert.
Is this the sound of the system?
An Lin was puzzled.
At this moment, an interface appeared in An Lin's mind.
The interface is gray and white, with only a few words displayed on it: The function of the God of War system will be activated after entering the Taichu Continent.
What the hell is the Primordial Continent?
An Lin thought of the recommendation letter from the Immortal, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand with great anticipation.
Then, he found that there was nothing in the golden paper, only a slightly sunken handprint.
An Lin didn't know why, but he still placed his hand on the paper to coincide with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper shone with golden light, and An Lin only had time to let out a "huh" in surprise before being completely swallowed by the golden light.
An Lin felt the world spinning for a while, and his vision changed from pitch black to bright again.
Then he found that his body appeared in the sky again and began to fall freely.
An Lin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off a building. No matter how many times he experienced that sourness, he wanted to cry.
An Lin raised his head with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he will never forget.
Two white-patterned dragon gate pillars with a height of hundreds of feet stood between the sky, and mysterious characters that he could not understand were engraved on the plaque.
Behind the gate, there are tens of thousands of palaces, with no end in sight.
Colorful clouds float around the palace, and all kinds of spirit beasts soar between the heaven and the earth, creating a majestic and majestic atmosphere.
An Lin stood there dumbfounded, with a shocked expression on his face.
It turns out that there really is a fairyland in this world!
An Lin tried his best to calm down and let himself calm down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe approaching, and hurried up to say hello.
"Hello, Sister Fairy." An Lin waved to the woman.
Seeing An Lin waving to her, the beautiful woman walked over.
Seeing this, An Lin asked a little excitedly: "This beautiful fairy sister, may I ask what is this place? I'm new here, so I don't know much about this place."
Hearing An Lin's words, the woman looked a little strange, and then said, "Ji Li Gu Lu?"
"Ah, what did you say?" An Lin was a little puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as An Lin, and said, "Ji Li Gu Lu Wah Chi Li?"
An Lin was stunned at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"Sister Fairy, can you speak Mandarin?" An Lin's eyes were moist.
"Gulu Gulu wah chirp?" The beautiful woman put her hands on her hips, a little annoyed.
It's over, the language barrier.
What the hell is she talking about? I can't understand it at all!
! Nani? Finally, An Lin cried.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On one platform, hundreds of people screamed and cheered, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most eye-catching convenience is the two cars that are about to start running.
One is the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488, worth more than 4 million yuan, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth 500,000 yuan. The two cars form a sharp contrast.
This is a duel between Liu Feng, a newly promoted young master of Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the top four young masters.
Beside the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han leaned against the car door silently. His clothes were sloppy, his hair was long, and his eyes were covered by bangs when he lowered his head. People could not see his closed eyes. On his cheeks, he could vaguely see the unique handsomeness of Young Master Zhang back then, but now his temperament has become full of decadence.
As for Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, he is like a star holding the moon, his expression seems to say that the world is under his feet.
"Let's go and have a look at Young Master Zhang who used to be aloof."
Liu Feng waved his hand, with a sneer on the corner of his mouth, he took the lead and walked over.
"Master Zhang?"
"Are you asleep? Young Master Zhang, who used to be invincible in the past, is now in such a state of despair, tsk tsk, the competition is about to start, why are you pretending to be indifferent, my Young Master Zhang!"
"He looks like a poor beggar in my opinion!"
"No, I don't think he is even as good as a beggar. Maybe he lives on pig food."
On the side of the Ford Mustang, stood a fat man with glasses, and beside his leg was a little girl of three or four years old.
The little girl has long pink and jade carvings, wears a white dress, and her delicate little face is like a cute princess in a fairy tale. Except for the messy hair, everything else is perfect, but at this time the little girl's big clear eyes contain tears of grievance , listening to everyone's scolding of Zhang Han, she seemed to be about to cry.
In normal times, the cute look of the little girl would probably attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng's performance time alone.
A burst of ridicule and abuse finally made Zhang Han react.
The moment Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a blank look in his eyes. He stared at the behavior of the people in front of him, and his eyes were full of contempt for the world.
"Do you and other ants dare to bark in front of this deity?"
Such an inexplicable sentence suddenly burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The audience was silent, but the next moment, a burst of ironic laughter rang out.
"Zhang Han, I think you are crazy, right?"
"I'm afraid I've become a fool."
Everyone mocked again, but when Zhang Han saw the picture in front of him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I raced with Liu Feng at Langxing Mountain in 2009?"
"Why am I here?"
"Aren't I going through a catastrophe?"
"Could it be... I'm back?"
"I was reborn by the Nine Heavens Thunder of the Heavenly Tribulation?" Zhang Han's eyes flashed with a tremor.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in Shangjing. Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of anything. The younger sister died, and the second uncle Zhang Ming served as the head of the family, but he couldn't stop the loneliness of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was hit hard at the time, thinking that his family members were murdered, and began to privately investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him, and Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was eventually kicked out of the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, Zhang Han refused to leave, and has been trying to find out the matter. The life is very hard but he has always persisted, until the Langxing Mountain incident.
I remember that when I was racing in the Langxing Mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident, lost my arms, survived for five years, and finally jumped off a cliff to commit suicide. I did not expect to enter the world of comprehension by accident. When he first came into contact with Immortal Cultivation, Zhang Han awakened his innate supernatural power - Wen Bao Nose, his nose can smell the breath of treasures within a certain range.
Relying on this supernatural power, Zhang Han used all kinds of treasures to accumulate his cultivation to the extreme in five hundred years.
"Why not five years ago?"
Zhang Han's expression raised a trace of loneliness.
Not fulfilling filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart. Before his relatives left, he was young and frivolous and ignorant. He caused a lot of trouble for his father, and even said a lot of words that made his mother sad. No matter how regretful he is, all of this can't be undone .
All good filial piety comes first. Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the beginning, his love for his parents is no less than that of others.
The tree wants to be quiet but the wind doesn't stop, the child wants to support but the relatives don't wait.
"Zhang Han!"
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he saw Liu Feng looking at him coldly.
"You drove me out of Shangjing five years ago!
Today, five years later, my Los Angeles car king, Liu Feng, is making a strong comeback, but you, Zhang Han, are not as good as a pig or a dog! Remember, today I, Liu Feng, let you, Zhang Han, go out to the capital sideways! "
"Oh, so powerful?" Zhang Han refused in surprise, "Then I won't compare."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the Ferrari car key in his hand, and said: "As long as you win against me, this car will be yours." "Then I will be too kind."
Zhang Han said with a smile.
"Ah."
Liu Feng sneered, and raised his hands to tell everyone in his skills: "Set up the screen!"
After the words fell, the people behind them set up several TV screens, and at the same time, remote-controlled planes were set up all over Langxing Mountain. When the screens were turned on, the footage from the remote-controlled planes was transmitted back one by one, reflecting the entire track of Langxing Mountain.
"Get ready to start!"
Liu Feng secretly nodded to the fat man in glasses behind the Ford Mustang, and got into the Ferrari.
"Daddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys
"Why does a cute little girl call someone daddy casually?"
Zhang Han shook his head funny.
"Brother Han, you will definitely win!"
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han and made an encouraging look.
"With your good words, your car will bring me good luck."
Zhang Han glanced at him indifferently, and sat sideways in the wild horse.
"Prepare!"
The angry roar of the engines of the two cars at the same time.
In the Ferrari, Liu Feng had a smug smile on his lips.
The fat man on the back let out a meaningful smile.
The eyes of the lovely princess at his feet were full of fear and worry, with tears in her eyes, which was so tender and pitiful.
As for Zhang Han in the wild horse, there was a sneer on the corner of his mouth.
"Collusion to harm me?"
"Unfortunately, I am no longer who I was back then." "Even if I don't have any cultivation now, how can you and other ants be able to provoke me?"
Chapter One
rust lake.
Federal No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site.
Also known as the "Magic Tomb".
With the continuous development of self-cultivation civilization, magic weapons that used to be aloof and only capable of being driven by self-cultivators have entered thousands of households and become an essential tool for ordinary people to travel, study and work at home.
While bringing convenience to life, it also produces a large amount of scrapped magic weapons and metal waste.
Most of these rubbish magic weapons have a lot of spiritual power left, which is easy to cause radiation pollution, and the talisman formations used to construct the magic weapons are extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion. If left unattended, it will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there will always be several "special garbage disposal sites" dedicated to disposing of scrapped magic weapons.
The No. 23 special garbage disposal site is located in the southern outskirts of "Fuge City", an important training town in the Federation.
Under the dim yellow sky, a swamp that was polluted into purple emitted a strong stench. The mountain peaks made of metal fragments looked like hundreds of dinosaurs protruding from the swamp. The peaks were full of fragmented flying swords. The rusty spar puppet and its hollow eye sockets have long since extinguished their spiritual fires, leaving only the worms that feed on spiritual energy poking their heads out from inside, carefully looking at this perilous "magic weapon cemetery".
"boom!"
Numerous metal components scattered flowers like celestial maidens, scattered and splashed in all directions, causing a series of collapses in the surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust all over the sky, like a demon dancing, covering the entire sky.
Here, it seems to be a forbidden zone of life, only the insignificant cockroaches and worms regard this place as a paradise.
Li Yao crouched behind a mountain of rubbish, licking his chapped lips, the khaki windbreaker was covered with dust, which made him blend in with the environment.
Glancing at the explosion cloud rising not far away, the boy's clear eyes showed no emotion at all, and the waves were calm.
It was only when the dirt and metal fragments splashed onto the garbage mountain where he was hiding, that he shrunk slightly into the depths of the garbage dump, and at the same time put on goggles big enough to cover half of his face.
"coming!"
At 3:52:38 in the afternoon, the daily routine garbage dumping time is also the carnival time for "garbage bugs" like Li Yao!
The Lingzi watch worn on his left wrist is a special hunting model launched by the cultivation sect "Flying Spirit Sect" three years ago. It took him two full months to repair it after he picked it up in the garbage mountain.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function, which can record vibrations of special frequencies and notify the owner when a specific vibration is heard nearby.
This function was originally used to remind hunters that there may be powerful monsters nearby.
But after Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder to him that the garbage ship was about to appear.
Moments later, accompanied by an insignificant hum, a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust that covered the sky and the sun from the explosion had not yet dissipated, and a dozen small black spots were mixed in it, and it was impossible to distinguish them clearly.
Li Yao shrugged his nose, and lightly touched a rune on the side of the goggle with his finger, "Shua", the surface of the goggle was blood red.
Under the scanning of the red light, the round figure of the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined clearly.
The hunting function of the Lingzi watch also firmly locked on the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Junk Ship No. 1327, it's you!"
From birth to ten years old, Li Yao has been staying in the tomb of magic weapons for ten years. He knows every inch of land here and every garbage ship in the sky. This "junk ship No. 1327" is specially responsible for collecting fugo Trash on the city's "Upper East Side".
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and rich area in the city, where many practitioners live, and the magic weapons they throw away are also the most valuable.
There are quite a few magic weapons that are even intact, just because they are slightly outdated, or a new generation of products has been launched, they are discarded by practitioners and rich people without any care.
To Li Yao, this is not a garbage ship, it is a treasure ship full of gold mines!
"Whoosh!"
With both feet, Li Yao shot out like projectiles, galloped between the garbage mountains, rushed towards the smoke and dust, and rushed towards the "garbage ship No. 1327"!
Surrounded by precarious mountains of rubbish, at the foot of the poisonous swamp that bubbled "Gulu Gulu", Li Yao was like the most dexterous monkey in the mountains and forests. It pops up dozens of meters away, and the movements are smooth and flowing, which is pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, you're robbing me for food again!"
At this moment, more than a dozen figures jumped out from behind several rubbish mountains. They were dressed similarly to Li Yao, but they didn't wear his advanced blood-red goggles and spirit watch.
These people were holding shovels and iron bars in their hands, and they were menacing.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage bugs who rely on the "No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site" to make a living.
Where there is interest, there is struggle. Shiploads of abandoned magic weapons may be just rubbish to the high-ranking cultivators, but to these poor people at the bottom, they are the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best in the grave of magic weapons The garbage bugs are naturally the thorn in the side of most garbage bugs, the thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao didn't care about it, he laughed, his waist suddenly exerted force, his figure twisted strangely, turned ninety degrees without any warning, dodged an obese young man with angry eyebrows in front of him, and took advantage of the momentum to slap his fat face He stomped hard, and taking advantage of this kick, he swept another thirty or forty meters away.
"Feilong, everyone come out to eat, the competition is who is faster, you should lose weight!"
There was a huge red mark on the fat boy's face, and his nose was almost sunken into the fat. He screamed in anger, commanding his subordinates to chase after him, and the group quickly entered the smoke and dust area.
There has just been an explosion here, and it is extremely unstable. Dozens of rubbish mountains will collapse at any moment. Even the ferocious Fat Dragon gang couldn't help but slow down when they entered this place, watching Li Yao run like lightning.
Fat Dragon couldn't help but spit.
Before the words were finished, another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of metal components and broken magic weapons rushed down like a flash flood!
"So clever!"
But a scream came from the smoke: "Xiao Hei, help!"
A black awn that was deeper than the night sky shot out, circled around in the metal torrent, and then rushed into the air. It turned out to be a rusty flying sword with a chipped blade and a pitch-black body. The flying sword has a huge handguard that spreads out like black wings. Li Yao is like a drowning man grasping at the straw, clumsily lying on the flying sword, surrounded by black lights, and rushing towards the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have revealed their huge statures. Each of them is hundreds of meters long. The round stature is like a legendary turtle supporting the earth. Thousands of runes, with flashing aura and colorful colors, help these big guys weighing tens of thousands of tons resist the invasion of gravity.
"Wow!"
The hatches in the belly of the "big turtles" opened, and an overwhelming amount of metal components and broken magic weapons poured out, smashing hard to the ground.
All of a sudden, the spiritual power in the entire world stirred wildly, setting off a stormy sea!
Even the garbage ship weighing tens of thousands of tons was swaying left and right in the wave of spiritual power, bumping violently, and had to separate desperately to reduce interference.
Feilong and the others dare not approach easily, for fear of being affected.
Li Yao was still riding the black flying sword and rushing left and right in the wave of spiritual power. Although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as nimble as a loach.
Of course he didn't dare to face the turbulent waves head-on, but with more than ten years of survival experience, he worked hard to find a relatively calm safe area between the spiritual tides, just to get as close as possible to the location of the magic weapon of garbage, and to get the moon first if he was near the water.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship roared like a monster, turned around, and returned lazily, and the smoke and dust gradually dissipated.
Fat Dragon managed to climb into the dump center where the garbage was densely packed, and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand new mountain of garbage, looking at him with a smile.
"Oh shit!"
Fat Dragon's face was shaking wildly, but his heart was quite conflicted.
The garbage mountain that Li Yao chose was quite ingenious, it wasn't the biggest garbage mountain, nor did it look like the one with the richest supplies.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing priceless magic weapons of garbage.
If you continue to entangle with Li Yao here, maybe you will be profited by other garbage fisherman.
There were other garbage bugs indistinctly around, and cheers erupted from many garbage mountains. It was because someone had found something valuable.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, a brat, was a student of the famous "Second High School Affiliated to Scarlet Sky Sect" in Fuge City.
The Akasaka Sect is a well-known sect in the south of the Federation, with powerful strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any true biography, it is not something that can be dealt with with three punches and two kicks. Otherwise, he would not have been alone in the tomb of the magic weapon for more than ten years, still alive and kicking, and even got the nickname "Vulture"!
But if he left like this, where would he put his face?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh! Feeling tangled in his heart, a gust of wind blew by, Fat Dragon subconsciously stretched out his hand to copy it, his hand was cold, but it was a discarded crystal brain the size of a fist.
Li Yao smiled and said: "Fat Long, everyone is here to beg for a living. Didn't they just rob you of a 'starlight' level crystal brain last time, and didn't kill your father? As for being so persistent? Well, I just found out I bought a 'Snapdragon 17' crystal brain refined by 'Qinglongmen'. It is the most advanced model and can calculate more than 5,000 thoughts per second. Although it burns out, I guess it can sell for three to four thousand yuan. , just treat me as a filial piety to you, Big Brother Fat Dragon, and we will be even, how about it?"
"You..." Fei Long didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this, he was stunned, and scratched the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the people from the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are coming soon, they are not like me, a solo traveler, they will definitely eat up dozens of garbage mountains, and they will not leave you with even a single screw !" Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, hurry up and sweep the goods!"
A group of garbage bugs scattered and rushed towards the garbage mountains in all directions.
Li Yao let out a long sigh of relief, and sat down on the garbage dump, with beads of sweat rolling down his forehead, and his smiling face instantly burst into mourning.
"Fatty man, the 'Snapdragon'-level crystal brain that I finally found, it's just cheap for you!"
"Just wait, are my 'Vulture Li Yao' things so easy to get?
One day I want you to eat mine and spit it out for me, and take mine back to me, plus interest, calculated as usury, let you know, why everyone calls me a vulture who wants money but not life '! "
"No, you have to speed up, the 'Wild Wolf Gang' gang is more unreasonable than Fat Dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you that I am going to save people, not commit suicide!"
"Don't lie to mom, you can't even plan a dog, and you still save people? Besides, there is no one in the river!"
Wang Yao was speechless. Today when he came down from the mountain, he saw someone falling into the river by the side of the village, so he hurriedly jumped down to save him. After he jumped down, he realized that he didn't know how to swim at all. What's more ironic is that the person who fell into the water was not a person, but a person. Inflatable doll, very realistic kind.
"There are still people in the village who are so fashionable to use this thing?!"
This was the last thought he had before he lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he was lying on the kang of his home, next to his parents, frowning.
In less than a day, the whole village knew that the idiot college student who contracted the mountain and planted herbs couldn't think about it, so he committed suicide by jumping into the river. "The children of today have never experienced setbacks and cannot stand blows!"
"The child is probably going to school. How can the famous college students go home to farm?"
"that is!"
"We won't plant this medicine anymore!"
The father who had been squatting by the side smoking a pipe angrily popped out this sentence, the people in the village have a good face, and the rumors made Lao Wang panic when he heard it, and if he planted it again, it would be fine to lose some money, maybe Even his son paid for it.
"That's right, listen to me this time, don't grow herbs anymore, go to the city another day and ask your sister to help find a decent job for you. The child of your uncle Changmao's family is just a graduate of an unknown school. I just got a job, and now I’m buying a house there!" Wang Yao’s mother also chimed in.
After hearing this, Wang Yao stopped arguing with his parents, so he nodded and agreed.
He was originally a student who graduated from a famous university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm and started his own business. He contracted a barren hill in the village, hoping to grow herbs and make a fortune. As a result, after he really started to work, he discovered that planting herbs is far from as simple as he imagined. It is not enough to rely on enthusiasm, and there are many things that are not in books. You can only rely on practice and experience.
In the first year, the herbal medicine he planted suffered from insect disease, and he lost all his money. In the second year, the herbal medicine bloomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots.
But after he became more comfortable, he went up to Nanshan again. This is a barren mountain. Maybe because of the soil quality, there are not many crops. There are more than a dozen big chestnut trees and jujube trees. There is a large gentle slope on the mountain, where he worked hard to cultivate. For the few acres of medicine fields that came out, he paid someone to build a hut on the mountain, hooked up the electricity, and took care of these few acres of medicine fields. , Said to give up, he was really reluctant.
Seeing the well-growing herbs, he reached out and touched them.
Do you want to try another year?
"The herb is detected, the trigger condition is met, do you want to activate the system?"
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What voice, who?!"
It is surrounded by mountains, water and woods, but there are no people.
"Hiss, could it be that I have hallucinations?"
"Do you want to activate the system?"
The sound of the weapon sounded again, and it seemed that it was just around the corner.
"There is a ghost!"
Wang Yao was shocked all over.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he uttered these words, a light curtain appeared in front of his eyes, very much like Wang Youzhong's character panel.
Hallucinations, must be hallucinations.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light curtain that appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Bark, woof, at this moment, a dirt dog rushed down from the mountain and came to him, sticking out its tongue and wagging its tail, looking very happy.
"Sanxian, where have you been?"
This is Wang Yao's native dog, who has been with him on this mountain for three years. One person and one dog entered the hut on the mountain, Wang Yao went to bed, feeling a little dizzy.
"What the hell was that just now?"
He read that Tong's name again, and as a result, the light curtain appeared again, like a projection.
"here we go again!"
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing is not an illusion, but a real thing that cannot be explained by science. There are character attributes, skills, and packages, just like online games.
Occupation Level: Rookie (Actually, you are not even a bird, at most you are an egg!
Physique 1, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average level of a normal adult male).
This is real? He was completely blindfolded.
That's great, he's growing herbs now, and that's all he needs! Wang Yao, who came back to his senses, jumped up excitedly, startling the "San Xian" beside him.
And a skill panel? Wang Yao thought about it but didn't look at it.
"Why can't it be opened?" He asked subconsciously.
"You can't grow medicinal herbs well, and if you want to do something else, go shovel shit!"
As if hearing his question, such a line of words popped out on the panel.
Damn, what's the matter? Whoever designed it, come out, I promise not to kill you! "What is this?"
Wang You clicked in the package column and found a water bottle-like logo.
The ancient spring pot contains ancient spring water, one barrel per day.
How to use it, reach for it?
As soon as Wang Yao thought about it, there was something extra in his hand, it was a wooden water jug, which was antique, and held in his hand, it was quite heavy, and when he shook it lightly, there was a sound of water in it.
"There is really water! Ancient spring water?"
He found a bucket from the room and poured out the water in the kettle. It was a small kettle, but the water kept coming out until the whole bucket was full.
so amazing?
! Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket, it was very clean and pure, he stretched out his hand to take a mouthful and put it in his mouth, it was very sweet.
delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. He drank three full bowls before stopping. After drinking this water, he felt much more comfortable and his fatigue disappeared.
Bark, woof, Sanxian on the side was circling around the bucket.
"Come on, drink some too."
Wang Yao also put a bowl in the basin where he drank water, and the dirt dog drank it up quickly, then barked again, wagging its tail, obviously it didn't drink enough.
"Okay, let you drink enough!"
This person and the dog drank half a bucket of water. If they hadn't been overwhelmed, they would have drunk up the bucket of water.
Wang Yao has never drank such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1 I want to lose weight!
On a scorching summer day, the Chiyun Rainforest located in the eastern part of the Federation is filled with clouds and mist, like a layer of tulle, towering old trees, criss-crossing, and in the lush canopy, sometimes a few birds soar into the sky, neighing and soaring in the sky between the sky.
In the sky, the sun that seems to exist forever is no longer what people remember, but was pierced directly by an indescribably huge ancient bronze sword many years ago, revealing half of the sword tip!
This ancient sword seems to have gone through eternity, coming from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes, and a strong coercion, forming a halo, covering the sky, as if it can suppress the earth and make all living beings worship!
From a distance, this scene of the Jianyang Rainforest is like a picture scroll, which was not broken until the sound of humming came from afar. A big red hot air balloon ship is slowly flying over the rainforest.
The cabin of this hot air balloon is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people. You can see many young men and women in groups on the deck, sometimes laughing and laughing.
They are students from the Misty Dao Academy, one of the four major avenues in the Federation, who are from Phoenix City. They are taking this airship belonging to the Misty Dao Academy to travel thousands of miles to study at the Misty Dao Academy.
Perhaps it is the expectation of studying, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, and there is some vague attraction between men and women, which makes this journey of thousands of miles not a little fun.
Because of the long distance, the airship is equipped with restaurants, spiritual rooms, medical rooms and other areas.
At the moment, there are quite a few students in the dining hall of the airship, and there is a little fat man sitting at one of the dining tables.
This little fat man is about seventeen or eighteen years old. He is wearing a blue long robe and has a round face that can be regarded as pretty. Looking at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him with regret.
"After eating this meal, I will gain another three catties. Why can't I hold it back? If I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young."
The little fat man frowned, and when he was filled with remorse, he burped. This little fat man is called Wang Baole, and he is also a student who was admitted to Misty Dao Academy this time. His dream in this life is to become an official, and he regards becoming the president of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit. The reason why he has such a great ideal is because of his Childhood experiences are inextricably linked.
In his memory, when he was young, his father often patted his head earnestly, sighing with emotion.
"Baole, it's better to be an official. You have to remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied. If you want to avoid being bullied, you have to be an official and become a superior person."
At the beginning Wang Baole didn't understand, until he was in primary school, because he didn't hand in homework on time, he was reprimanded by the monitor, and after he gave two pieces of candy, he was registered by the monitor and gave a small report to the teacher. An indelible imprint was left on the soul.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be a squad leader, not to bully others, but to prevent himself from being bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he found that there were many others who could bully the squad leader, so he felt that if he became the biggest official, that is, the president of the Federation, no one would dare to bully him. The reason why he sharpened his head and was admitted to the Misty Dao Academy was also because all the high-ranking officials of the Federation graduated from the Four Dao Academy.
It's just that his life is not very good, and the family blood is very strange. He still remembers that night a year ago, his skinny father showed him the family tree in the family's ancestral hall.
That was the first time Wang Baole had seen the genealogy. He could clearly see that all the ancestors from generation to generation who weighed more than 200 catties died young and lived no more than thirty-five.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... Before he became the President of the Federation, he was reunited with those fat grandpas.
In the next year, for him, weight loss had reached a certain level, but even after the Federation entered the Lingyuan Era, with the richness of the spiritual energy and the revival of ancient martial arts, the way to lose weight was also difficult. There are all kinds of things, but Wang Baole has tried almost all of them, and his weight is still steady.
The memory surfaced, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and made up his mind to lose weight tomorrow.
After making such a decision, Wang Baole suddenly felt a lot less stressed. While picking his teeth, he hummed a little song, looked up at the blue sky outside the window, and his mind began to come alive.
"I don't know the gift for Dr. Lu. He likes it or not. It's an antique that I brought out from home. That old guy should like it."
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he got close to Dr. Lu, he would have a small backer in the Taoist monastery in the future.
"The teacher has limited authority, but he will also give some gifts in the future, but Dr. Lu must have a lot of connections because of his age. I should be on the right track with this step."
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was delighted, and felt that he was one step closer to the position of Federation President.
He is very confident that he can become the president of the Federation. This confidence mainly comes from the autobiographies of all the senior officials he has studied since he was a child, and he even summed up a few tricks for being an official.
Feeling happy physically and mentally at this moment, Wang Baole also felt particularly beautiful when he looked at the blue sky outside the window.
But soon, his eyes widened suddenly, and he noticed that in the distant sky, there was a condensed black cloud, which seemed to cover the sky, and there were thunder and lightning within it, flashing with lightning, and it was slowly approaching, this scene It also attracted the attention of many students, and there were exclamations.
Wang Baole was also taken aback. In fact, after the Federation stepped into the Spiritual Era, due to the appearance of spiritual energy, many amazing weathers were born in the world. The flying objects used to be difficult to be safe. The birth of the balloon airship.
With the constant exclamation, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, the loud noise shook the sky, and one could see the black cloud of thunder and magnetism growing rapidly in the distance, and the lightning within it had spread, like a big black net, shining in the sky, dazzling Shocking, people's heartbeat can't help but speed up, and the airship that was originally moving is slowly slowing down at this moment.
Just when everyone was restless, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, as if there was a howling wind, and an old man in a white Taoist robe walked in. His eyes were shining brightly, and his whole body was filled with righteousness. As soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
"Everyone, report in the spiritual room immediately, put on your magnetic clothing, and after half a stick of incense, we will enter the lightning magnetic field!"
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the cafeteria were in awe and stood up quickly.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up. The old man in front of him was Dr. Lu whom he had given gifts to before. Looking at the other party's aura of walking like a dragon and a tiger, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was right. I am even more skilled at chess.
Just when he was very pleased with himself, the old doctor glanced at Wang Baole, snorted, walked over, took out half of a black mask from his arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At a young age, don't put your mind on messy things. You have learned to give gifts before you entered the monastery. This old man is also a well-informed person. You should keep this mask for yourself." The old doctor looked Serenely, with a clean and upright appearance, he reprimanded as if he hated iron but steel.
Wang Baole took the mask and felt a thud in his heart. He could see that the old doctor was angry and was a little anxious. He was about to explain, but he suddenly thought of the trump card he had summarized in the autobiography of those high-ranking officials. Time to admit mistakes can often turn big things into small ones.
So he took a deep breath, quickly put on a look of remorse, and admitted his mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong!"
The old doctor was a little surprised, the words that were supposed to be reprimanded, but because the other party admitted his mistake so readily, he couldn't continue.
Seeing the old doctor's expression, Wang Baole breathed a sigh of relief, and felt a little complacent, secretly thinking that this autobiography of a senior official is indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, raised his head and looked at all the students in the restaurant, pointing to everyone with his right hand.
"And you, you are all future students of my Misty Taoist Academy, look at what you are like these days, you must always remember, my generation of warriors should stand up first, then speak, and then act!"
The old doctor hated him deeply, his words echoed in the restaurant, and everyone couldn't help bowing their heads, a little ashamed after hearing them, but Wang Baole's eyes lit up suddenly, feeling that it was time to express himself.
So he quickly took out a small book from his arms and wrote it down. From time to time, he looked up at the old doctor, showing a listening expression, and nodded seriously from time to time, as if he wanted to remember every word the other party said. The killer feature he summed up in the autobiography of senior officials.
Seeing this scene, other students looked at Wang Baole as if they were gods.
After the old doctor saw it, he was stunned for a moment. An unprecedented feeling of weirdness came to his mind. It was really the first time he had met such a wonderful person. After a few more glances, he gradually sneered.
"Little guy, the old man's flattery is not so easy to shoot, you have to thank the thunder and magnetic storm, otherwise, the old man can train for three days and three nights in one go, I see if you can write it all in a small book!"
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, his aura suddenly changed. A strong aura emanated from him, as if turning into coercion, covering the entire restaurant. All the students were stunned. The road is one foot high.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade slip in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and then looked at the approaching thunder and magnetic storm, or gave up the idea of taking it out. He felt that it was not ashamed to be cowardly in front of his boss.
Seeing everyone's expressions, the old doctor was proud and said a few words impassionedly.
"Remember, you must put your mind on cultivation. In the future, you must not be greedy or unrighteous, and don't always think about finding a female companion. You must know that there is a knife on the head of the color. These days, you are so indifferent to each other. Fair enough!"
Right at this point, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from the old doctor's sound transmission bracelet.
"Grandpa doctor, where are you? People don't know how to wear this magnetic suit. Come and help me."
Hearing this charming voice, the old doctor trembled involuntarily, forced a dry cough, and gave everyone a serious look, then turned and left impatiently, and at the same time spoke excitedly to the spirit bracelet. "Oh, here it is, baby, don't worry, I'll come and help you."
The reversal of this scene was too fast, the contrast was too great, everyone was dumbfounded, even Wang Baole was stunned for a while, before he took a breath, following the uproar that the crowd couldn't help, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and cursed a few words.
"This old pervert, what you said before is bullshit! There are only so many female classmates, and we don't have enough points. At his age, he still comes to compete with us for resources. Isn't he an official just because of his size!"
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the angrier he became, and while discussing with the students around him, his dream of becoming an official became more firm in his heart.
As the sound of the sirens intensified, everyone ended their discussion and went to the spiritual room angrily.
The spiritual room is located in the core area of the airship. As the name suggests, it is a place for these students to practice. It is also the place where the airship is most closely protected when passing through a special area.
At this moment in this spiritual practice room, as the crowd gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher accompanying the boat from Misty Daoist Academy, everyone sat in several rows and put on the airship-specific magnetic spiritual clothes issued by Misty Daoist Academy.
Just after putting on the magnetic suit, Wang Baole was immersed in his dissatisfaction with Dr. Lu. He casually raised his head and looked around. His depressed mood suddenly became worse because of a distant gaze. He unconsciously frowned, revealing Look disgusted.
Where he was looking, there was a girl with slender legs sitting, she was very attractive, but now she was frowning, showing a look of disgust, obviously in their mutual eyes, the other party was familiar and extremely disgusted.
"unlucky!"
Both of them murmured in their hearts, and hurriedly avoided their eyes, as if even looking at each other felt hot.
"I can meet this flat Dumin everywhere, it's so annoying!" "What's so great, isn't it just a bad squad leader, when I get to the Taoist Academy, with my official trump card, I can also be an official job!"
Soon, after everyone was dressed, the teachers on board the Misty Taoist Academy checked one by one, and they explained some precautions, and even sternly warned everyone that after the airship entered the lightning magnetic field, there was danger, and there was a certain possibility of life and death crisis.
After seeing the changes in everyone's expressions, these teachers who accompanied the boat left solemnly. The door of the spiritual practice room was also sealed directly, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment in the spiritual practice room, although there were still low-pitched conversations, as time passed, the tension became more and more intense. Gradually, no one spoke, and it fell into complete silence.
In this silence where one could hear one's own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in a state of discontent, couldn't help becoming nervous. After half a stick of incense, the whole airship shook violently and entered the area of thunder and magnetism!
Seen from the outside, the entire thunder magnetic black cloud is extremely majestic, like a big mouth, compared with it, it is a very small hot air balloon airship, which can be swallowed directly.
This kind of weather seems to contain the power of destruction, and it can sweep everything away. Perhaps only the shocking sword sun in the sky can ignore everything, as if looking down on the world for thirty-seven years is not enough, and it will take longer.
This year is the thirty-seventh year of Lingyuan.
In 3029 A.D., the earth's science and technology developed rapidly, there was no national border, the earth was unified, and the federal era was entered. It was at this time that a big sword flew from the starry sky, pierced the sun, and caused a sensation in the world.
The hilt of the great sword, perhaps because it was originally broken, broke into a large number of fragments in this violent vibration, scattered all over the starry sky, and some of them fell to various parts of the earth.
With the arrival of the great bronze sword and the falling of the fragments, a new energy source suddenly appeared on the earth that seemed to permeate the heaven and earth, and it was named... aura!
Spiritual energy is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin, and because the scattered fragments were obtained by the Federation and various forces, I found various exercises related to cultivation, refining tools, alchemy, and refining spirit stones. The characters on it are full of ancient meanings, which lead people to come into contact with ancient characters and become a trend.
The emergence of spiritual energy also quickly eliminated the original energy and changed people's lives. It not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the progress of the earth's civilization, enabling the entire earth to open up a civilization of practice.
From then on, the rise of ancient martial arts, great changes in the world, and the era of all people cultivating immortals began.
It is known in history as the Lingyuan Era.
But at this moment, in the black cloud of thunder and magnetism, the slowly moving red hot air balloon airship was bombarded by countless lightning bolts around it. Fortunately, there was a soft light curtain to diffuse and protect the airship, making the airship extremely stable.
As for the spiritual cultivation room in the core area of the cabin, all students, including Wang Baole, had fallen into a deep sleep at this moment, as if there was a strange force guiding them into a dream.
Only in the main pavilion at the bow of the ship, there are currently seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some smiling, chatting with each other relaxedly, completely different from the way they frightened the students before.
The leader is an old man with wrinkled face, holding a bong and smoking. If Wang Baole was here, he would definitely recognize this old man, the shameless old doctor Lu before.
Following the words of a middle-aged teacher, the smoking old doctor smiled slightly.
