Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New bedding signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blooms" is the name of a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering hins are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. "If the weather is favourable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the undertaking does not only remain an action by conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming here so beautifully. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started
More recently, shrubs such as winter honeysuckle and winter viburnum are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter honeysuckle is a very broad-bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it reads under further information, for example on the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started. It blooms particularly profusely on the Richtweg near the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them when he looks down from the sky at Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tapping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say a musical performer, worked together with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, each of which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analogue is growing again for some
The speed with which our everyday lives became digital left us little time to set up rules for dealing with them and to adapt our communication and working methods to them, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call your relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you could go to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic headphones and the click of the coins in the vending machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisers.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hostile to pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023 there will be a proper celebration again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't have to wait long.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea came to Franconia the Minister of Justice, Georg Eisenreich, and his wife Anja.
Completely out of touch: Minister for Science and the Arts, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
Ilse Aigner, president of the state parliament, sought out none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the master builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the roller: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a mime. At his side is his wife Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out anymore, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's Lord Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Brisk as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small swipe at the climate activists by the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world championship titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV pundit, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended their title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the chase race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, nothing came together at Doll again. After the veteran had missed all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty lap in the mixed relay and there had only been sixth place, things didn't go any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, he surprisingly won in Hochfilzen by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing pulled away without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will focus on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied with regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly invaded parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not pay much attention to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and night," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied – an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note about the press - the Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? It showed the members of the Red Army Faction cleared for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is publishing a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's about it: Ms. Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me anymore who reads this paper. If it does, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level where nothing is below that.
And now, at the latest, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need for differentiation here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: "I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has filed an application with the competent court for the annulment of his civil partnership. I don't comment on details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and there had been rumors of separation for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to the german-French peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for german-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeias, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series North Lippe hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in homias. Here the inhabitants will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can rise again slightly, and China's opening up can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and held out the prospect of a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher lending rates can lead to investments being postponed and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more severe than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although the upward trend in prices weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's (SPD) proclamation of the "German pace" in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge that does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals that went into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the German government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and did not succeed. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was the right one. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for us."
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of break-up of Bayer Group
The chemical trade union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the company after an announced change of boss at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is exactly right for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, member of the union's Board of Management and Bayer Supervisory Board, told the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription medicines, the Consumer Health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background to this is the change of management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-head of pharmaceuticals of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto, completed in 2018 for 63 billion dollars, hangs on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. Bayer's stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to ratify the actions of the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the value of the company," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing a government project with the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilising against the centre-right government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants in protests were counted. A turbulent debate in parliament has been going on for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a deduction-free pension by the time they reach retirement age. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Imminent deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an imminent deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics cast doubt on the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to work on the retirement age. The increase in the required payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protest and strikes were certain for all.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, which have announced support. But some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's concern about paralyzing strikes at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Admittedly, this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges there is pure sun".
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can still rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains very cloudy or overcast with high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, nibbles on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only around 3 degrees are expected. In addition, weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday there may again be only tough dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be cheerful after the fog has cleared. At high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was severely disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," the Italian said on ZDF after she had threaded a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races in this discipline so far this season. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She was absent from her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second," said Goggia after Switzerland's Jasmine Flury's surprising victory in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: "But they are not".
Girl missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for clues about their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in the search for a missing child. 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school on February 10, 2023 at around 12:30 p.m. together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. It was there at the S-Bahn station that she was last seen. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local area.

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint conference call, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus will not be allowed to be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and unbearable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The occasion for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations that it would reject the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events don't happen in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk up where it happens
"Hey, butt!", whistling after the fool in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting lewd sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling". The term refers to nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Lost half of the vehicles? : U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stockpile of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Speaking at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to U.S. estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kyiv the delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other countries, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy was begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means, for example, that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Fuss about filling posts in the army
Because the post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption of posts and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
A call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously vacant position, the minister said. She did not want to comment on "speculation by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious accusations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision is based on the "appearance of postenschacher," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees in front of costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, including for security, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "Parade of Merry People" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the existing ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that doesn't happen every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By luck in disguise, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many personnel will be needed for security as in 2020.
If you stand by the side of the road during the Shrove Monday procession in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much with them. Camel or not, the rush of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain from buckets that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd," says Cologne train conductor Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular Shrove Monday parade for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the train."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is generally "deficient", that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Home-Distilled Vodka
It is not for nothing that Ukrainians are considered hard-drinking. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not a Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't see much difference in taste. The same goes for the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But this is only true if it goes on mass sale. There will probably also be adulteration.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees victory as favourite and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the official gallery on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were really falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the clouds of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Nevertheless, Steinmeier enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "I have been fascinated by biathlon since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernised sports facilities: "The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded." In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outpaced the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two rays of hope behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed match on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
In front of 14,300 spectators, Bö had started the race with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the capable; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. In the women's race, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said sporting director Felix Bitterling, taking his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeases "swarm of bees" on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee's ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "punish unsportsmanlike conduct consistently". Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the way people interact on the pitch. "I think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches had also been dismissed. Mainz coach Bo Svensson was shown the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. "Coaching behaviour also falls into the realm of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike behaviour consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the ratio is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with this. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process as a whole were to get underway, that such behavior is simply not appropriate," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes will not compete in the Black Forest with the best line-up. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek will not be there. They are training in Oberstdorf to prepare for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist bumped into a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous pictorial examples, she presents the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in architecture in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants were issued against 33 people, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have facilitated the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at noon. More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Second-to-last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow, died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Bundestag group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing "an important personality," said parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the elections to the People's Chamber on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière as the last prime minister of the GDR until reunification.
The chairman of the parliamentary group of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow was "quite critical" of the new state. German reunification had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had gone down too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv will have to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kyiv, an air alert was sounded for the fifth time for the day late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for grid company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to split them off, failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, it was agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctual. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this grievance with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", her pulse had not come down as soon as she ran in. "A race like that," and that at the home World Championships, "you can't describe it in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had planned to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She currently occupies fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the women's performance density is significantly higher at the top than that of the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were rather others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the U.S. government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and the same threatens other projects, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was approved by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money will be available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the current high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is declining.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit in the direction of Heilbronn onto the motorway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, police said. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not reveal any complaints. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be hospitalized. The two cars suffered property damage totalling around 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
On Friday evening, many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is a great deal of sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
The catastrophic earthquake in Turkey and Syria is occupying the world's minds. On Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had responded to the call of the Ditib Mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the Imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their condolences for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The supplications were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind over several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you shall rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. After all, if you don't sit in the middle of a rocky desert thanks to your home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, you can now use your lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least that's the impression you could get around Lake Egglburg, where not only dog owners cavort between 12 noon and 2 p.m.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. After all, why not learn news from the settlement from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet your girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It would also be possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do excellently is the purchase of natural resources. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table by the side of the road along with the cheese. Or potatoes and meat. It's just stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and regret in their voices. "It's a pity, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. Which you let the sympathetic chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! They do have a bag with them!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat and on this midday short trip you have not only been enriched by a saddle of lamb, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time, in fact, for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and came off the road in a left-hand curve to the right for an unknown reason, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a delineator, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's Tax Records: Point for the Rule of Law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided: the tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision said on Friday.
Contrary to political conventions in the United States, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He defended himself all the way to the Supreme Court against a surrender. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless it came to a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of authorized users is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information repeatedly leaks out of Parliament.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract with the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes just shove people and hamburgers in between. In her new program, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the "in-between" state.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of a lot - and one or the other is also between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. at the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British felon caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British Criminal Investigation Department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most wanted by the NCA.
According to the authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 before the start of a court case in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempted import of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. After all, people should come to Vespers first and foremost to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu. It starts this Sunday, when St. Mary's Church in Neustadt becomes a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Tales from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humour, takes up the cudgels for science in his cabaret programmes. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism. In any case, his sense of humor fits very well with Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do - and what it cannot. Of course, there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.
Please go to the typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.
My cell phone rings with an unknown number. I suppose. This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.
The Nordcon team continues: "In contrast to our old location, we have very few stairs left.
MP Pfeiffer describes climate protection as a substitute religion. That may even be true, because I love this planet and its civilization more than any abstract god
Ten firefighters and two police officers were injured in the explosion, some seriously.
I can dismiss it all as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that city politicians have been aware of the advantages for decades and never question them.
Peace and security at the turn of the times? On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Church of Solidarity, the Peace Plenum and the Evangelical Church of Solidarity invite you to a meeting. Stadtakademie for a lecture and discussion event in the Ev. University on the topic of "Peace and Security at the Turn of the Times?"
I really don't understand why they don't do such events on Sundays. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and mess up the image even further!?
It's brilliant how well #LuisaNeubauer gets to the heart of it. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard gives details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of all stripes are travelling to Germany together (!) for the first time.
I'm curious who I'll meet there and who I'll get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer eleven, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she is also a CDU minister.
So that's really nothing new, it's the same with every electronic ticket. Checkin/checkout is a different house number.
Certainly no reason to do something about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Does anyone play #wortify and found the word with all the letters today? If so, please let me know, it's driving me crazy right now.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tanker. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation sequence, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test procedure. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint can be, for example: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, a dot becomes visible that represents the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRING RANGE is displayed in the upper left hint display at the same time.
Occasionally, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A Super Tank drives and spins twice as fast as the Player Tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the stander the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum results, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table at the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button is pressed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the highest results is deleted. When RESET is performed, the top ten (10) scores are obtained with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank icon, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write in dashes. After that, the device switches back to the attraction gameplay. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shifter. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer parts of the housing, which made this unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever to the center position. The micro shells are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator board and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make gaming easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Equipment Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to round out the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V mains. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance hatch of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide so that a correct connection is made. A connector twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the gaming PC board for proper and tight fit. (3) Pay attention to the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped production numbers match those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, knob/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange circled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not precisely centered, the cladding, which is attached to the housing with an adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Verify the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To enter the DirectX diagnostic program, please follow these steps: Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. In the text box, type "dxdiag". Now you will see the user interface of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check if the graphics and sound are working properly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
It may happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious to be active, and many start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That is why we recommend that you terminate such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the program's icon on the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also quit general background applications as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to quit all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install any software, it's important to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run largely smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support") to access Windows Help. 2. Now, click in the Search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Disk Defragmenter" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a guide explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This is often a way to prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to create video games was sparked in me by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. For me, it was an opportunity to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits feelings. Although this could of course have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just about fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you're more skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your mindset. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us to question many of the principles previously considered incontrovertible. I'd be lucky if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you — doesn't leave you completely unscathed either. David Cage

SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPAXX. The course of the game is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In the event of an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you will not be able to cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be applied and your mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, german) with which the address programming and the game work. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or default setting can be reached, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press "Up" switch". The values are reset, the pointer (so the lines appearing green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs in order for his own initials (names) and the hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, - if there is a coin lock - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be placed so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, the credits cannot become zero if more than 99 is added. A free spins mode can be chosen by setting "Maximum Credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": the level of the % that must be reached in order to switch to the next pass.
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Degree of difficulty of the gameplay
"Tightening tone": at "0" no sound when stationary
with "1" tone also when stationary (animated tone) "Tabletop model": with "0" floor-standing unit
at "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "slot programming" display. High-score program display (highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous display (setting "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX Standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total Credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts all over again. The total number can only appear on 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of credits given for coins inserted (revalued). Loans granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits granted (Credits paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes gained: Number of minutes, if the game is extended or won. % of free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/Paid + Credits granted
High Score: The number at which a player had high enough hit rates to knock other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the display or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons selects the programming, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is applied. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. In case of unintentional pressing, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" Coin Units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value "0" is not used. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably indicates failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING & SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed. If an endurance test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is shut down. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" indicator appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory, which is shared between two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: fault in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are inscribed to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their former value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device with the above display stops, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when they are read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must exist and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any recognizable seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented myself from the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips... in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. It's just a shame. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I mismeasured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. Then I slightly changed something to make it fit. The overlay looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him because of the size. Now, at 12 months, we have picked him out again and he can use it. Hasn't been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And if he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping that it would be so, but there is really no question of that. The upholstered walls are much thinner and don't offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more unstable. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack would go back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money on a decent backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far, I had liked the electrics series by E. L. Todd best, but my opinion has been revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time and I found it unnecessarily drawn-out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admitting everything to herself and then being like a little child in every argument and grimacing?! At the same time, there were also discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more suspense back into the story.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and always designed according to the same scheme. When you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, they often bring tears to your eyes. That's why Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that people just can't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and us. Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings :None. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been 5 stars in it. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger one full 5 ? This is very, very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like it did on the first try. Worst of all, it still stinked weeks after using it. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not quite flawless !! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major flaws, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems "connecting" to the mobile phone over time. This means that it is no longer charged even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but it creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the cost of 30€, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I expected a lot more from these scarves, it's also really very, very thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side, the price for these cloths is far exaggerated, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is rendered as bass and is not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were reproduced quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to deduct one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
In a few places the paint was chipped and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A PRAISE to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't find fault with it, as I desperately needed this product. The included adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. Some of the stencils are incompletely punched out. It's ok for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasp + beautiful look + stable when it is set up + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slam with magnets (maybe you can compensate for it with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and have them since there was no trophy in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (wrapped it with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars,  Because you have to make everything fit in order to be really satisfied. Besides, I think it's a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me.... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't run through evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall by hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. I'm sure Amazon would have arranged this quickly and accommodatingly, but I didn't find out until after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color tends to go in the direction of cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I would personally go for warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is a help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positively. I've been thinking for a long time whether I should order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and they're gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping simply great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts. We found out that the part had already been installed. We have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and returned. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon, but prefer to spend a little more in the hardware store, where we get decent goods. I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like this!!
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. At the same time, the thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside humidity are always displayed. This is a pity, because the device was attached to the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with a weak grass collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still driving through the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and it results in a nice cutting pattern. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the catcher. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down for a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red even when the grass collector is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket of a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass collector makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save the battery. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm if the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the screw falls out at the front right, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the trolley are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it's impossible to print something out that way. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to lay them again several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. Was expecting a little more.
Robust and precise I am pleasantly surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and I think it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. There is a clear buy recommendation from me and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and didn't wear it for the time being because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly "aired". After returning it is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Discount from purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I have already torn open the clasp twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that it won't last long. But for the low price you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with a little leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately junk! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now for the function: Connects only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not useful for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it will only bring trouble!
Damage in transit
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
Could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. In the beginning, everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I didn't find a suitable flat-head screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw immediately. Now to get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can put the screw on different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread broke off on the third time I mounted it and thus the entire thing became unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the stated dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight. Since I don't have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, e.g. for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the case - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags. Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas too. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Bartered. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables. Battery life is sufficient for a very long time. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning deal. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse than that. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it doesn't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the film. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port facing up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a disdainful extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So it's not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it also holds so safely and has contact from there... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdily manufactured in an aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it performs well. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen several times on the tiled floor and has survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised, in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so the battery wouldn't have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You should deal with the dog, not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap on the heel is quite loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I've wiped it away and hope it doesn't reappear. When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly. It's easy to lie on and fits in perfectly with the festival. Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Previously, we took out the seats in the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my boyfriend is a skilled craftsman, he was able to repair it and reassembled, the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ridiculous processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors on it and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, because they were already coming towards him. The parts often come out of a mess, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies with it. Indoors, it flies very well and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite sufficient. I didn't expect hair to get stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it was not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. Operation worked well.... And yet I send them back. The big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, only on drm cabinet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, not usable for me. What a pity.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. Most recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case offers here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a sturdy impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only at the ports there are recesses. Otherwise, you can operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. It doesn't even work on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality cover with bulletproof glass foil
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall, a good buy.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences has been detected.
Persistent microchimerism could induce SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like response.
Autologous blood samples before elective surgical procedures help to reduce the perioperative risk, but can also trigger side effects.
Are there any special patient characteristics that affect the frequency and severity of adverse events?
Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not begin until adulthood, which is then referred to as Still's disease with onset in adulthood ("adult onset Still's disease").
Diagnostic criteria include a characteristic rash, joint discomfort, bouts of fever and leukocytosis, as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat with no detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and lack of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a long time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The rash of Still's disease is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply defined maculae, which are very volatile.

The assessment of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or a melanocytic nevus that can be considered for differential diagnosis, uniform and reproducible histological criteria must be required.
In the case of malignant melanoma, the prognostically relevant tumor parameters that are important for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and uniformly in the histopathological report.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children pose a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Infections with a variety of pathogens are possible, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens, Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses are in the foreground.
In 25-30% of cases, however, the respiratory symptoms are based on non-infectious causes.
Medical history, lung X-rays and blood tests are often of little help in making a diagnosis.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage results in 60-80% diagnostic clarification, the remaining cases must be diagnosed - with the appropriate clinic - by a mostly open lung biopsy.
It mainly affects women of younger to middle age.
In the German-speaking world, this clinical picture has not yet been mentioned in the literature.
We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical picture of IMDE (type I).
The particular interest of this casuistry is the fact that there is no light dependence, which has also been shown by the fact that no deterioration has occurred under PUVA therapy.
IMDE is probably a special disease from the group of elastolytic diseases, in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Based on the pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to verify the efficiency of the direct reduction of stenosing trailing edge fragments performed under intraoperative, sonographic control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is wider than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates greater narrowing.
In the case of fractures without neurological deficits, fragment reduction promises to avoid long-term damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there are indications of ultrasound analgesia in patients with non-radicular back pain under serial application as a function of the prescribed power density (LD).
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult-to-reposition mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal part of the mandibula can also be successfully treated by monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a rank value for the classification of trauma, seems to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between the two therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for describing a mandibular trauma that all studies designed so far with their small number of cases can at best provide a rough differential indication.
As long as there is no prospective multicenter study that could provide a decision-making aid in the choice of osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid range between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and underrepresentations of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, software was developed that enables the objective recording of the location and nature of the changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures, created from a patient's tomography data.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robot systems can provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned as well as in spatial orientation in the surgical site.
After more than 30 years of successful centralization of laboratory analysis, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction in the size of laboratory analyses are increasingly leading to a renewed re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed close to the patient outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample quantities.
While these benefits are often highlighted, they are not associated with a clear clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analytical instruments by the untrained station staff, lack or lack of calibration and/or quality control, costs due to the provision of multiple instruments and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between the POCT results and the routine laboratory results, are also apparent.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation (24-hour central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analytes necessary for this should be:
Hemoglobin or hematocrit, activated whole blood clotting time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
The prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantitation, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still in its early stages.
It is possible that MR tomography can gain considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, characteristic skeletal changes occur.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the bone mass changes of the spine during long-term hemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spines were completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly.
Vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular linkage (TBPf) were quantitatively evaluated.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution over the spine known from the skeletally healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve decreasing from the cervical spine to the lumbar spine is 5% lower for the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd lumbar spine is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
Cases with prolonged haemodialysis have higher BV/TV scores, regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological cross-linking of the spongiasa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP shows a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be deduced from the 2-D sectional planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional cancellous architecture in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of inguinal hernia that did not correspond to what was previously known due to its course of the disease and the post-mortem findings collected by Littré himself.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall hernia in a scientific paper on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
On the basis of a case report, the historical reappraisal of this form of hernia takes place.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder whose first description was made in 1944 by Hans Asperger, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 80s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disorder is unclear.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome is presented, in whom epilepsy and internal abnormalities existed at the same time.
Possible comorbidities of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsy are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic approach.
Yersinia infections usually manifest themselves in childhood as febrile gastro-enteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
It is reported about a child in whom yersinia infection manifested itself as tumor-like lymphadenitis with long-lasting persistence localized in the mesenteric root.
The diagnosis was made by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer Yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after therapy with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings return to normal.
The application of pulse oximetry in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were investigated as to what conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and what consequences result from these findings.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
At this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented, highlighting the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old female patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumptive coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative period after vaginal hysterectomy, followed by septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected in this autologous blood reserve, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous haemotherapy also carries a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and that the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a serious infection caused by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association that developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis after candidal sepsis, leading to hydronephrosis with onset of postrenal renal failure.
Under antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin, as well as direct irrigation with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy, the excretory function was normalized.
With the increasing frequency of systemic Candida infections, especially in neonatology, the possibility of bezoar formation should also be considered as a differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to be able to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some patients do not respond to this therapy or respond only inadequately.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the following parameters:
Skin type, minimum erythema dose, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, it was found that the non-responders had a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, the non-responders were comparatively more likely to have a strong bacterial colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestine with Candida albicans.
These findings indicate that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized by a particularly severe atopy syndrome on the one hand and complicating superinfections on the other.
The latter finding suggests that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment may be beneficial for these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
On the basis of two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is shown.
Clinically, subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates are present, which can lead to ulceration and cicatricial retractions.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
A positive direct immunofluorescence test (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal boundary and vessels is also considered a further diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance, since lupus erythematosus profundus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old female patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has existed for over 45 years.
The patient died under the clinical signs of cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicological analyses.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been intense research interest in the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatments for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse forms for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, old age, with limited cardiac pump function, after previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires a risk stratification that can be used to divide the surgical risk into "low", "medium" and "high".
A distinction can be made between pre-, intra- and postoperative patient, structural and treatment-related factors.
On the basis of this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra- and post-operative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, especially spinaliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
We report on a 65-year-old female patient who developed 15 malignant melanoma, one spinalioma and one lymph node metastasis of malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complementation analysis, which resulted in an assignment to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies on the breast, thoracic wall and/or abdominal wall that have been untreated for years and have been exulcerated in the meantime confront the plastic surgeon with the need for large defect coverage after tumor resection.
By using silver-containing activated carbon fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer pads (Allevyn), an infection could be avoided after flank replacement by an omentumplasty as part of the resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable trunk wall even without the use of plastic meshes.
The 2000 health care reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and general practitioners for outpatient care will not be touched.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogues will be specified for outpatient operations that may not be performed on an inpatient basis.
The obligation to ensure quality assurance will be clarified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multi-organ failure is a complex immunological process which is influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is amplified by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of cells, both locally and system-wide.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may ultimately provide a better understanding of the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually non-specific.
X-rays often only show lightening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities.
Root tip resorption may be another important finding.
After a brief historical outline, a short report on the current state of knowledge is given for each individual type, building on the currently valid WHO classification.
This is then used to develop the therapy concept that is valid today, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
Generalized Mood Disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness that is often recognized late, for which a uniformity of mental experience in the face of circumstances is characteristic, such as those that are usually the cause of depressive mood, despair, great fear, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can decisively improve the quality of life of the person concerned and prevent adverse individual and social long-term consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapy regimen that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and preserve the patient's life.
This article presents the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special emphasis on molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT / dental scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in distinguishing bony lesions from neighboring anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows an accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of currently available studies on oral IC therapy have not been randomized, double-blind or placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, therefore, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turk who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratoses or plane warts.
Ultrastructurally, keratinocytes show premature and defective keratinization.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be distinguished from severe, congenital keratinization disorders that show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
In order to reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic substances are often used today in procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in cardiac anesthesia.
At the same time, however, there are concerns about their potential as a trigger for thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECC should be compared.
The imaging diagnosis of manubriostane joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
Involvement of the manubriosteranl joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized due to endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.
The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the functional outcomes of surgical treatment.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of a Pseudologia phantastica in his childhood.
The determinants of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this thesis.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the characteristic HLA B27 will be investigated.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms that has existed since the age of 14 is presented.
It is not an obsessive-compulsive disorder in its own right, but schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Under the treatment of schizophrenic symptoms exacerbating at the age of 31 with clozapine, neither psychotic symptoms nor any significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms are found in the one-year catamnesis.
While the literature increasingly points to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenia, here - as far as the author knows - the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia improved by clozapine is described.
The importance of differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of individual cases.
An isomorphic stimulus effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli.
It is reported that such a Koebner phenomenon is triggered in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis foci developed in the viral lesions after a varicella infection.
Since the person concerned was planning a stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was made to rule out an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to develop such a disease according to genetic risk factors, and to determine whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a vaccination reaction;
Initial experiences and results with 13 single-stage reconstructions of large complex defects in the head and neck area with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major islet lobes are reported.
Complete flap losses did not occur in any case.
Better functional and aesthetic results were achieved with the free forearm graft, but the surgery times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
The main disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are its poor malleability and a limited radius of rotation.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically leads to an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has so far been considered a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there have recently been indications that exogenous factors can put endothelial cells into an inflammatory state even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of tissue-specific mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, are an indication for the local administration of rTPA.
We report on our findings.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node, which was first described 5 years ago and has not yet been documented in German-language literature, is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of palisade-like myofibroblastic cells (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) accentuated haemorrhage zones to the periphery, their diagnostic criteria include the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is significant for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel inner splints, obstruction and kinking could be reduced and a regression of the congestion of the proximal hollow system could be achieved.
Furthermore, in addition to the flow of urine within the splints, this technique allows an increased flow between the splints, which is considered to be a crucial mechanism of urine passage in horizontal ureteral splints.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression, in which the insertion of a singular inner splint does not result in sufficient regression of ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative that may require some patients to use a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis), intradiscal application of chymopapain is the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
The purpose of a prospective study was to investigate the value of diuresis sonography compared to the diuresis ephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorders.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas.
The method has been further developed and modified over the last 20 years.
Currently, there are three variations to choose from:
All three methods have the same goal:
radical tumor removal while sparing the non-affected tissue of the surrounding area.
However, they have significant differences with regard to the technique of tumor excision, the consolidation of histological sections and the histological preparation evaluation.
A methodological inventory is carried out and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The "Marjolin ulcer" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with a lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiotherapy and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedunculated radial artery flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with epidural administration of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is demonstrated, also in the context of patient-controlled on-demand epidural analgesia (PCA).
The intrathecal mode of administration is said to have various advantages over the epidural.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
In terms of the quality of analgesia, serious side effects, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of thoracic over lumbar injection.
There are indications that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of choice for patients with high preoperative risk and at the same time cost-effective.
Thanks to the cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardised patch residues are recorded centrally at the participating centres in Germany.
For the present study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Peru balsam and thimerosal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also compiled for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema location, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and specific questions.
In percentage terms, there were strikingly fewer positive reactions to nickel, fragrance mix and Peru balsam in men than in women.
Younger patients reacted more frequently to thimerosal, older to medical externals.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found more frequently in hand eczemats.
Nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers had higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thimerosal reactions was often not recognizable.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all people infected (in contact) with M. leprae, the disease does not openly break out.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T cell-mediated immune response.
This review article considers current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies have been presented to quantitatively investigate the Tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (KW) using laser tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the UCS in comparison to the Tyndall intensity in the KW for uveitids of different localization, the extent to which the Tyndall increase is actually caused by a UCS disorder should be investigated as an example.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglycides, caprolactones and other substances containing polyglactines has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defensive reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of neurites.
Positive results from animal experiments do not stand up to clinical scrutiny, as inferior regeneration performance can occur in animal experiments despite a hindered regeneration pathway.
Morbidity caused by acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term effects is the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of genitourinary infections, and one-third developed cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter, chronic complaints and long-term effects of ascending genital infections occurred during the course.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other opportunistic infections typical of AIDS, but usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed more frequently.
Complications of pregnancy include premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth.
Progression of maternal HIV infection due to pregnancy was not observed.
Risks of peripartum infection transmission in the fetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV-RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as preterm birth, preterm labor, amniotic infection, duration of rupture and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternofetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low-contamination caesarean section delivery (4-6%) and most successfully by primary sectio and concomitant prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells play a central role in the initialization of the immune response, as they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies in patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized in vitro with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis was investigated immunohistologically.
The results show that, in contrast to T lymphocytes, dendritic cells are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with the clinical parameters, it can be seen that the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor of the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered a major factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
In the present study, in patients with renal insufficiency, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways transulfurization (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methylmalonate and 2-methyl citrate) were determined in addition to homocysteine.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the anamnesis and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in the years 1984-94 at a university polyclinic or a dermatological practice was carried out on the basis of patient files and, in some cases, follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean duration of illness was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
Atopy was present in 46.4% of patients, and 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholinger, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and wheezing-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were positive only in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracyclines 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), 13 patients achieved complete remission and improvement was achieved in 8.
20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) experienced spontaneous remission over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment successes with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old female patient is reported, who presented primarily with lumbalgia.
Both laboratory, radiological and histopathological, the findings spoke primarily for the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excisions, the histologically present picture of a non-specific inflammation.
It was only during the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal that a highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could be detected histologically.
Chemotherapy according to the CHOP scheme and radiotherapy treatment were followed.
Lymphomas of the spine should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive cases.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or fractures of the frontobase in over 90% of cases.
In up to 70% of cases, concomitant skull base fractures run through the roof of the ethmoid cells or the lamina cribrosa.
There are different concepts for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures as well as combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
In the period from 1990 to 1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without skull base involvement, reduction and treatment were performed via a subcranial access route.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data could be evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for the extra- and transcranial treatment of fractures of the ethmoid bone with involvement of the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
however, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be treated surgically.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures with chest compressions and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was completed with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In the case of fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed with continued chest compressions.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics could be achieved with continuous, high-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
As a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy, a massive transfusion was required.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were dispensed with.
In anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount administered is metabolized.
The magnitude of the resulting serum peak values of inorganic fluoride is determined primarily by the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered, and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use or with protracted anesthesia duration, nor in use in patients with renal insufficiency, an increased renal hazard potential for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane could be detected.
The recently demonstrated low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoridin-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 μmol/l, which has been used in the literature so far, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those encountered after anesthesia with sevoflurane, are therefore to be classified as clinically harmless.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of the macroscopic method of preparation is of fundamental importance.
The best results are provided by the base-parallel lamination of the ventricles of the heart and the transverse lamination of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries after fixation, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can precede it.
With this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference and transmural expansion of infarctions, their age and sequelae can be better recorded and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than in the case of the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the bloodstream.
In the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed intact, as can the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in the case of acute cardiac death and territorial ischemia that has only survived for a short time.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be detected in correlation to coronary morphology and the coronary care area.
However, recent prospective randomized trials show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after R0 resection does not provide an additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus as well as adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction and stomach are not yet conclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, several phase III studies did not show a convincing prognosis gain through preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined radio/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach can only be expected if there is a response to pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio/chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out within the framework of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual for children, is usually only associated with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or "hysterical" symptoms can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Non-assimilable memories of trauma have a retraumatizing effect and must be warded off, for example through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior or social "acting".
On this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparatory phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers are created in the imagination in a resource-oriented way.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stable confrontation, but as little retraumatizing as possible introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and abandonment.
In the final phase, the focus is again on the resource-oriented turn towards creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years with regard to diagnoses and the proportion of people with multiple disabilities.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor cerebri"), a venous outflow obstruction is possible as a cause.
The extent to which visual acuity remains stable over the long term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy was investigated, and which causes and risk factors for deterioration of visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entry point.
After inoculation, HIV replication can start after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can be used to detect the budding HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, while the antibody response is weakened under therapy;
with nuleinic acid tests, detection succeeds from about the eleventh day.
In almost 100 years of development, countless endogenous, exogenous and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central third of the patellar tendon, a quadruple tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some restrictions, the use of cadaveric grafts is also justified.
The individual grafts have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the mentioned grafts could not be verified.
When selecting a graft, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account.
In the treatment of complex ligament injuries and revision cases, careful, preoperative planning with possibly modified graft selection is required.
The rare course of the development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrence tumor developed 2 times in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological work-up showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological features taking into account the literature are discussed.
Coronary calcium is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance differs depending on whether calcium screening is performed in patients with already known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant aspect of coronary artery disease.
In this thesis, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, with regard to ergometry, are presented as well as hints for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred in the context of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we did not observe any case of ITP among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
In patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, other diseases of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II should therefore be excluded.
Securing the airway after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
It is therefore important to ensure safe reintubation if necessary.
Two patients are reported who had considerable intubation difficulties due to papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma and thus high risk factors for intubation and, if necessary, reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiber-optically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor spread pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for staging and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive examinations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity of both methods is less high than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two cross-sectional imaging methods is important from a clinical point of view, as it makes it possible to exclude neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable clues about a possible etiology, the extent of submucosal growth, and the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators (ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with end-stage renal disease have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.
There are only small numbers of cases of myocardial revascularization using PTCA in patients on chronic dialysis, which suggest a high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate overall.
We evaluated the rate of restenosis in 23 patients with end-stage renal disease (17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primarily successful PTCA, recoronary angiography was performed in all patients within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic control, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginous complaints.
Laboratory tests showed hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient is described, in whom complete instability of the pelvis occurred within a year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.
A minor trauma to the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed to be the triggering event.
Due to the X-ray morphology of multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignant event was initially the main focus of the diagnosis at the time of differential diagnosis.
Hip pain in childhood can be caused by a wide range of different clinical pictures.
The focus is on non-traumatic causes in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand, and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Exemplary examples are used to demonstrate some common, but also rarer clinical pictures.
The iatrogenic termination of the trochanter major in the prosthetic treatment of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "posterior access" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated traumatic trochanteric blasting, which is used here for comparison, even in the case of significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still controversially discussed.
The present work presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail on the basis of data from quality assurance.
The ZUF-8 is used to investigate relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, further utilization behavior of patients, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This shows that the correlation between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly large.
In terms of further utilisation behaviour, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are relatively large, but in absolute terms these effects are rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in the aging process of men are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels decline on average with age, correlations between middle-aged and older symptoms and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is related, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men and a variety of influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea that had been present for five days was subjected to sonography before the planned lysis therapy after nuclear medicine indicated a stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
A right-atrial, floating thrombus was found.
Ultra-high-dose short-term streptokinase lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase for 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated in the event of acute vital hazard.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the thrombosis of the leg had largely dissolved.
The treated patients were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
A single fracture was detected in 50% of patients, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytraumas.
The average duration of hospitalization was 17 days and the use of crutches was an average of 21 weeks, which indicates a relatively rapid healing process.
In the majority (85%), the treatment was without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with an open fracture in 9 (1.8%), and in patients with closed fractures in only 2 cases (0.4%), which is within the usual norms.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics for head and neck tumors is still controversially discussed.
In the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were used to investigate which factors influence the frequency and localization of distant metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastases correlated positively with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001) as well as with the manifestation of local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a second tumor outside the ENT range (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumor localization' and 'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, did not have an independent predictive value, but essentially reflected different frequencies of the tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in tumors of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to an X-ray examination of the thorax.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal ultrasonography, skeletal scintigraphy and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumors, recurrences and secondary tumors outside the ENT range.
However, one should always ask oneself the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article provides a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the 19th century to the present day.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who worked with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in 1927 in Germany.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions in professional societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine".
Nevertheless, Simmel's emphasis should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish ancestry, are no longer duly remembered.
Basically, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, necrosis of the femoral head, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomography/sonographic analysis of the leg geometry is of central importance here.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a completely individual problem.
The aim of the study was to meta-analytically review all available randomized controlled trials in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur as part of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term by systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to one-sided compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs in more than 80% of cases on the compression side, a causal relationship can be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the case of a herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, which was developed for malignant changes in the area of the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and burdened with high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be performed on the patients in a blood-saving manner and with almost no complications.
With a median follow-up period of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, and one patient who underwent surgery for a gastrinoma was found to have elevated gastrin levels late postoperatively.
Compared to the preoperative functional test, it was shown that the endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly impaired by the operation.
With strict indications, benign tumors in the area of the head of the pancreas can thus be treated adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications and without permanent restriction of exo- and endocrine functions by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardic cardiac arrhythmias.
About one in six patients dies of sudden cardiac death after pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly due to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart can carry the risk of triggering and/or aggravation of life-threatening ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.
Especially in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-induced R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-induced secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable, but above all safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative objectives, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are referred to alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), sonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial cancer.
For specific questions, e.g. after a chest wall infiltration, and for patients with a contrast medium allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) for the assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, in-111-octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical significance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor receptor, could play an important role in the staging of bronchus cancer in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and small pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs may occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, the prevention of such side effects is of particular importance in tumor therapy.
Impairment of erection or disorders of ejaculation can occur after surgical, radiotherapy or drug therapy of various tumors.
Through an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now preventable in a high percentage.
If damage to the corresponding nerve tracts cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunctions are a significant restriction of quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated by a number of therapy modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the cervical vessels at different cannulation sites.
It is reported about a truck driver after crushing trauma to both legs, who developed atypical hepar-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under drug thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
in addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with positive antibody detection against heparin:
During our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically split on the left lower leg.
After excluding possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after irrigation of an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction, which could be immediately broken by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, which is otherwise described as characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin, which occurs on the cell surface of platelets.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the different forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without platelet drop and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
In 1991, basal adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the "Histological typing of salivary gland tumors" of the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first description goes back to Ellis and Wiskovitch (1990) of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
The parotid gland is the seat of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistries;
The case presented here involves a middle-aged woman with basal adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumor extirpation with sufficient safety margin and histologically controlled tumor-free of all resection margins.
According to the current state of knowledge, basal elladronocarcinoma is associated with a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenous metastasis rate of 10% up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal model of renal xenotransplantation was developed, in which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs to wist-in rats as recipient animals, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta or v. cava and ureteral drainage by splinting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenografts.
A total of 24 xenotransplantations were performed and randomly treated with 3 ml of 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity in the sCR1 group was observed, which is due to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, histological evidence showed masses of platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates in the control group.
The kidney transplants treated with sCR1, on the other hand, showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and interstitium in the therapy group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic procedures have been performed on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and inguinal hernia with the robotic arm for optical guidance, which is controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is directly determined by commands from the surgeon.
In all interventions, the control of the robot arm was precise, the speech recognition accurate and without technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by one surgeon alone as "solo surgery".
In a further 20 procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications caused by DSA in kidney and pancreas transplants requires invasive intervention in vessels that are usually diabetic, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated on the basis of a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation between the trauma surgery and medical clinics of the Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapy result and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both in terms of local rehabilitation of the infection and the functional outcome.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor an interruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the kostoclavicular space.
Casuistically, the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus as a result of a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is one of the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the hospital of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the Children's Hospital of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory response is reported after the use of absorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgery, resulting in a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was a sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Primary plasmacytomas of the kidney represent a large rarity.
So far, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented in whom an operated kidney tumor turned out to be a plasmacytoma histologically.
On the basis of this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary renal involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
Within the framework of a multicenter, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, a treatment indication or a suitable therapy procedure corresponding to the fracture type was selected for 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-based score.
So far, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known that follow the pattern of Blaschko's lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired striped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he singled out as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are streak-like skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, no inflammatory precursor and no subsequent sclerotherapy or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults, following the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and, to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise program that can also be carried out safely as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge of anatomy, osteoarthritis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors are imparted.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated osteoarthritis of the knee was demonstrated in a prospectively randomized study.
For successful and permanent knee replacement, the correct alignment and size of the implants is of paramount importance.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are presented.
In the context of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has proven to be suitable for separating patients with secure disease from secured controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital first aid of 274 acutely injured (58%) or sick (42%) children up to the age of 14 was first assessed with regard to the time of the missions, compliance with the assistance period, age and gender distribution, severity, trauma causes and injury patterns, the type of acute paediatric disease, pre-hospital emergency diagnostics and therapy as well as the means of transport and the Target clinic examined on the basis of the emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the Orthopaedic University Hospital Mainz has been testing the diseases for which low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be used sensibly.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations for diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age and sex-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in the present study on subjects.
Therapy control is currently not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion condition due to atrial fibrillation.
For this reason, patients without an actual tendency to recurrence are sometimes uselessly exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A mandatory prerequisite for P-wave analysis under sinusoidal rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must take place, the filtering of the P-wave must be carried out bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is urgently desired.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in the P wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic drug does not affect the P wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P wave is significantly different.
In summary, the signaling of the P wave after optimization of the method allows the identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
A prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is knowledge of the genesis of pain.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are directed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is based on injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to chronification of such pain.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, coanalgesics and opioid analgesics are of particular importance for chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapy standards must be observed.
Blockages with local anesthetics as monotherapy of chronic pain are obsolete today.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations can be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages are of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific questions are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In the case of T3/4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of the paraaortic lymphatic drainage pathways compared to the irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes alone does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies with outdated irradiation technology.
Radiotherapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymphatic carcinoma is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be carried out within the framework of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
However, due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively treated by a thin-caliber drainage.
On the other hand, in the case of a complicated pneumothorax, large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in ventilator patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnostics.
A haemothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with Bülau drainage and, if necessary, surgically treated due to the risk of severe blood loss.
A spontaneous hemothorax also requires drainage and internal clarification.
The physician in an internal intensive care unit must be proficient in the diagnosis and therapy of pneumo- and haematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 ICU patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in ICU patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory tests, microbiology and radiology.
Likewise, the lethality, the overall injury severity, the probability of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic concomitant injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. pelvic injury with concomitant peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions is at the forefront of interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabular fractures pose a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
With an increase in the number of these additional pathologies, the long-term result worsens.
Primary accidental cartilage damage appears to have a significant impact on long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
Isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old female patient, such as coarctation of the aorta.
What is remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or an expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of the photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
With reference to the change in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has recently been called into question.
In the discourse on the application and development of reproductive techniques, the experiential aspects of those affected recede into the background.
Many people only ask for help outside of medical treatment at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastasis sites in metastatic mammary, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic methods of therapy depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
In the case of receptor-positive breast carcinomas and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the therapy of first choice.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or when liver metastases are detected.
In the case of small cell lung carcinomas, chemotherapy should always be performed.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is rather cautious and is limited primarily to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for the determination of bone resorption products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve stretching pain should be investigated.
The risk of becoming infected with HIV at work is often subjectively considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, for example, there is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In case of injuries with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-exposure.
There is no drug post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon in the detection of HCV RNA seems to have a high success rate.
In preparations of a videothoracoscopically obtained lung biopsy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strongly positive reactions both in the muscularly differentiated tissue of angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscular proliferates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal lobe, up to 5 cm in diameter.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal neoplasms predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in kidneys, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion on euthanasia issues, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to give preference to medical assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in 1994 on assisted suicide of a psychiatrist gives rise to an examination of this problem from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations was investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically.
Both by means of the NADPH diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemically, a differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, stroma and vessels could be detected.
In the case of the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there seems to be a pronounced reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out due to the small number of preparations.
In the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of NOS depending on the vascular section could also be detected by means of the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional blood flow and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse causes of ileus, it is difficult to standardize the surgical indication and surgical choice of procedure for small intestine ileus.
A uniform approach to the intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, insertion of an intestinal splint) and abdominal wall closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small intestine plication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble surgery largely replaced by Child-Phillips plication and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no confirmed indications or contraindications for plicatures, long probes and other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socio-economic importance of small intestine ileus, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive field of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can make it possible to increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, and at the same time prevent misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the affected couples.
Gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength in depressed individuals have often been described in the clinical literature, but have hardly been empirically investigated.
We assessed various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework based essentially on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressed persons were examined by means of standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which record stride length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace and 3-min walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy test subjects.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were demonstrated, especially in knee and elbow extension and also in all gait parameters examined.
The methods, which were used for the first time for psychiatric issues in the present pilot study, are suitable for the reliable and low-stress investigation of relationships between depression and motor skills and can thus be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can lead to an acute attack of glaucoma in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We report on the results after cataract surgery for subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls (N), the scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
Apart from punctual deviations, the VIP plasma concentrations did not show any significant differences from the normal values (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurological decline, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex, and storage phenomena in lymphocytes up to the age of 3,2 and 4 years, respectively.
L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was severely decreased (<3% of normal).
So far, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who came to hospitalization with the signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased CSF protein were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this routinely performed test, strongly positive results for ketones were obtained in the autopsy of three people who clearly died as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without at the same time increasing the glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography revealed excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L in all three urine samples.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal glucose findings in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study of 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it will be examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can make statements about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide information for the therapeutic procedure.
Infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in the context of various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, papules and papulovesicles appeared eruptively symmetrically on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, whereas serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
TMJ dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are primarily based on the anatomical relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation and disc dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
In a number of neurological diseases, temporomandibular joint dislocations have been described as a complication.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Stains can lead to significant psychosocial distress.
The present study investigated a) the coping behavior, quality of life and body experience of patients with stains and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A psychological test was carried out on 70 patients with stains with stains as part of therapy with the flash lamp-pulsed dye laser on the areas of coping with illness, quality of life and body experience.
The clinical outcome criterion was the degree of lightening of the fire mark during the course of therapy.
Patients with stains showed comparably high levels of stress in terms of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the stain.
With regard to helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients were significantly less burdened with stains.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
The experience of the body is differentially influenced by coping with the disease.
Since lightening in the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stress, flash lamp pulsed dye laser therapy for port-wine stains can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is a disease in its own right, as the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological manifestations and a wide range of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had a sebaceal nevus in the right temple area since birth.
Histopathological examination revealed 2 adnexneoplasias associated with the lesion:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, the appearance of Q-spikes, newly appeared left bundle branch block) and elevated levels of the "classic heart enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementia.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia in a patient over 80 years of age within a few months.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the course of therapy of the disease that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with concomitant hypothyroidism and dementia caused secondarily by hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, an aneurysm of the left subclavian artery near the outlet was successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graft.
The follow-up over a period of one year showed a very good long-term result with a freely perfused stent lum and a completely switched off aneurysm.
A control computed tomography scan revealed a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac.
Intravascular ultrasound found no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent.
The pyoderma gangrenosum was first described as a separate entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.
Nevertheless, as early as the first half of the 19th century, there are illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie that almost inevitably suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains, in addition to casuistries of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin, individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers that occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy commonly used at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this sprawling therapy with mercury, as they healed spontaneously after discontinuation.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of the pyoderma gangrenosum can be found more than 100 years before it was first named.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not yet been sufficiently clarified.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of the pyoderma gangrenosum persisted in several publications until well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study addresses the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions is faster after TIVA with remifentanil/propofol (P/R) than after balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Uniform estradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly fluctuating drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high doses of estrogen when administered orally are necessary because there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism during the passage of the liver.
What is the significance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and therapy planning of meconium peritonitis?
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel matresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and psychomotor retardation, who has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The aim of the present study was to measure the physical exercise capacity of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-dependent changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or tumors of the urinary bladder was to better understand the biology of the different lesions and to make a clearer distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The significance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically examined.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, as well as papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include shallow hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to show correlations between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention in the sympathetic nervous system.
This is referred to as a sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and the acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back problems.
The routine diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multi-phase abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor extension, contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindication to non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated renal insufficiency (not yet requiring dialysis) and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood are chemical burns, burns, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign bodies, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants/year.
This makes them the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for childhood eye injury include age (<5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care.
The prognosis with regard to visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced not only by rapid and adequate therapy, but also by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or masking of the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis).
Deficits and imbalances of the spine-stabilizing muscles are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back problems.
Therefore, the aim of prevention and rehabilitation must be to maintain and restore the full performance of the muscles stabilizing the spine, in addition to training coordination skills and learning how to behave in a way that is appropriate for the spine.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, the physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including the procedures on a neurophysiological basis, the physical-balneological measures and the supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In its phase structure, various therapy goals, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the course of rehabilitation, are presented.
Indications and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
Depending on the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, the therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation with physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The indication for spondylolisthesis surgery is pain, progressive gliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and in the case of spondyloptosis, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass may occur with further progression of the sliding.
With the external fixator as a reduction instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now also possible to reduce severe sliding processes and restore a normal spine and trunk shape with an acceptable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed which, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at the anatomical reduction of the sliding vertebra.
Depending on the extent of the sliding, reduction and stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
Dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
At grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this article, is to assess the effects of a Gerontopsychiatric Center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and counselling for the elderly) for the first time to subject the process of change from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical-outpatient, i.e. house-based) regional care structures demanded and extensively justified by the Federal Government's Commission of Experts.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional care substructures of gerontopsychiatry (subsystem A), general practice (subsystem B) and geriatric care (subsystem C) are analysed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ).
With regard to subsystem A, the study shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form from intramural to extramural care, without delegating its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the system of care for the elderly (subsystem C) may be expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh care region the rate of home admissions after clinical-inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulite on her right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive restriction of movement in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to edema of skin and fatty tissue, sonography and computed tomography also revealed extensive fluid accumulation around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitia and - to a lesser extent - in the shoulder joint.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, the skin lesions quickly healed, and in the further course also the mobility in the shoulder joint was restored.
In the case described, involvement of structures close to the joint in the context of eosinophilic cellulite was demonstrated for the first time using modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide enables breast-conserving treatment for larger tumors that are not primarily suitable for breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be tracked with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
Mammography has good reproducibility and availability.
Tumors that cannot be delineated by mammogram can usually be visualized sonographically.
In MRI, the tumor extent is independent of the structure and density of the mammal arenchyma.
It also allows the recording of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residuals after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially non-invasive tumor remnants can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even if the invasive tumor regresses and typically indicate intraductal, non-invasive tumor residuals.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the ICU.
This report discusses the treatment of severe GBS in the intensive care unit using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenosis, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be able to immediately apply an emerging dissection and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical therapies for Parkinson's disease (PK) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-pronged functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei were successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - The clinic currently uses both lesional and restorative and stimulative procedures.
The techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy, which were already used in the past, have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological target location.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter method has proven to be effective for the treatment of tremor.
Only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a new sprouting of dopaminergic neurons and an increased striatal dopamine release documented;
however, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
High-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
In the animal experimental approach, xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells are used.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol-related disease, along with more common disorders such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal spasm, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic lateral steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body.
Laboratory tests showed increased values for gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI revealed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-fold anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and deterioration of the general condition continued to be observed.
Several EEG examinations revealed periodic steep left parietookzipital waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinoma in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell naevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, organoid nevus or following radiotherapy is very rare (86 cases in the world literature so far).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of BZNS or the consequence of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical examination gave any indication of a genetic predisposition to basal cell formation.
In 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed using iliac crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Morphometric analysis was used to calculate significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their progenitor cells, and fiber density.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already observed in about 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic progenitor cells, which can be related by the incorporation of this cell line into iron metabolism, h‰moglobin synthesis and degradation of the eluted normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residues-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 30% of biopsies prior to treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrillation with clinical parameters such as h‰moglobin levels, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood and spleen size could be calculated.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification into three different histological subgroups was made:
Corresponding h‰matological data were assigned to this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies on 173 patients receiving monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment are best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the assigned temporal differences.
For example, in patients with a complete h‰matological remission after IFN administration, erythropoiesis regeneration was observed together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages, including their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups detected a transition from both a (non-fiberized) granulocytic and megakaryocytic subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of patients.
This phenomenon contrasted with a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic type, especially in patients undergoing HU therapy, in 17 cases (36%).
Taken together, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 patients admitted consecutively to a medical-geriatric department were to be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination and the values in the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as unexaminable.
The remaining 74 patients were evaluated clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia developments may have been detected or excluded by neuropsychological testing.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, in more than half of them the disorder was relevant for the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains unclear how, according to this result, the therapy of the mental disorder required for every 5th to 6th patient can be guaranteed in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are investigator dependency, the lack of standardization and the still relatively high costs.
For this reason, the "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Center Berlin", which is made up of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also elaborated and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Job's syndrome, Buckley's syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial rash, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphoid organs, and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Strongly increased IgE concentrations in the serum with the simultaneous absence of indications of allergic and parasitic diseases are diagnostically indicative.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerated and highly effective.
More than a year after the single therapy, the symptoms are persistently improved.
The current state of knowledge and the available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In the case of hyper-IgE syndrome, a therapy trial with IVIG should be a first-line option.
The present study presents the results after laparoscopic floppy nits fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
More than 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new antireflux operation if necessary.
Persistent side effects of the operation that did not impair quality of life were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required re-drug antireflux therapy.
Laparoscopic refundoplication was necessary due to persistent dysphagia in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic floppy nits fundoplication can be documented and proven in the long term not only by objective findings, but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by the measurement of quality of life data.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are groundbreaking, as evidenced by the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on the size and location, the resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appear to be superior to selective tumor removal.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under Section 216 of the German Criminal Code;
it is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
The various tendencies to exempt "killing on demand" from punishment in Germany under certain conditions, as in the Netherlands, do not change this.
Nutrient proportions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally differentiated from immunologically active cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in seriously ill patients.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are important for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells, especially as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are fermented bacterially in the lower sections of the intestine to form mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
Among other things, these exert a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the food-independent substances, it is mainly the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and mental well-being.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual evaluations of situational factors influencing nursing on the one hand and stress-promoting factors in the nursing process on the other.
The results show both large individual differences in the evaluation of stress factors and their effects on physical and mental well-being.
Extension fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the area of the ankle joints.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus has a significant influence on the long-term outcome.
Computed tomography (CT) is essential for a definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be taken.
Dislocated fractures, treated conservatively, as far as described in the literature and according to one's own experience, lead to pain and restriction of movement and thus to arthritic remodeling of the subtalar joint in the long term.
In the indication for a surgical procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to enable healing without consequences.
Comminuted fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to any changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unclear, there are a number of recent findings on the underlying pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, an increase in dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in indolent mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to popular belief, acute urticaria is rarely caused by IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory tract infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudo-allergies to food (73%) and, more rarely, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) usually play a role, with long-lasting remissions in avoidance (diet) or elimination of triggers.
On the other hand, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly secondary and not disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a vitally threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to present the variability of possible injuries along with scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which can usually only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the chronological sequence of the polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of care.
Reports of previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small patient population show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus to define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, whereby cross-references to the management are made together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly vitally threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course over 2 months to 35.2 years is known (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20 %) was found at higher T stages, and synchronous lymph node and distant metastases increased.
In the statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (<= 20 %/ > 20 %), synchronous distant metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1) and the radicality of the intervention (R0/R1, 2) proved to be relevant for prognosis.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a danger to adults due to the postponement of the age peak.
The MMR combination vaccination is an effective method for preventing this disease and its consequences.
The 2-malignant MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make rubella embryopathy a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied ageing in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.
In a regional comparison, personality differences were found in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness as well as in subjective well-being.
Meaningful interactions between age group and region emerged for openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement as well as physician judgment.
More than 80% of intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and usually occur after abdominal surgery.
In terms of anatomy, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
Today, sonographic or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective procedure with few complications and a success rate of approx. 80% for defined indications.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventionally, pancreas, spleen and Crohn's abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
Since the mid to late 80s, various research groups have tried to improve the prediction of premature birth in prematurity by immunological diagnostics - in particular by cytokine detection.
However, it turns out to be disadvantageous that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been convincing from the amniotic fluid, i.e. by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the wide range of variation of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
It is possible that cytokine detection from the cervix of pregnant women using PCR technology is a viable option for the future.
The load on the internal fixator for the spine was measured using instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion while standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured when sitting than when standing.
There is therefore little to be said against allowing patients whose spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
Due to the additional ventral stabilization with bone chips, the load on the bisegmental implants was often significantly changed.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher after ventral stabilization than before.
A corset or bodice did not reduce the implant load.
It is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningioma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to designate meningiomas with an increased tendency to recurrence compared to usual meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined core-area-related Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 degrees (N=160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the "recurrence"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a poorly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Optionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, apart from the typical loss of chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas showed a distal piece loss on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of cases.
Histochemically, we were able to show that in meningiomas, the tissue-nonspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is located at 1p, can be used as a progression- and recurrence-associated marker enzyme (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and can give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose the term intermediate-type meningiomas for this group of tumors that are relatively prone to recurrence, which is located between the usual and anaplastic meningiomas.
Due to the special anatomical situation, joint process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment is in the case of severely dislocated or dislocated fractures.
Preauricular, sub- or perimandibular, retromandibular and oral approaches are established as surgical approaches.
For the fixation of the fragments, only functionally stable methods, such as the mini-plate or tension screw, should be used.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with focal liver lesions prior to liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas, as well as palmoplantar keratosis after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing cerebrospinal fluid Fowleri (Fowler's);
Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as a secondary finding.
Background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely inadequately represented in the basic health services established there.
The aim was to investigate the long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care system in relation to the prevalence of skin diseases.
The rate of growth as well as its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) inside and outside a single hospital of primary care.
Due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities, the PhotoDermVL enables a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasias, nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, to identify risk factors regarding the occurrence and to evaluate the benefit of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute episodes.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often almost impossible to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur in the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which could hardly be controlled even by administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
Both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins in addition to the immunosuppression performed.
In both cases, the immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine), which were originally used in high doses, could be tapered off to minimal maintenance therapy.
After every 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained symptom-free during the follow-up period of 1 year under minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is one of the most common symptoms in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very patchy in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood light has been applied by the addition of fluorescent markers in the application control of topicals.
Endocardial mapping is possible when hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced as part of programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circular excitation by stimulation maneuvers ("entrainment mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardias, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases by high-frequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a recurrence must be expected.
In the case of incessant ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, early catheter ablation is indicated.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapy procedure to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1.1.1985 to 31.12.1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively investigated in 386 patients with rectal carcinoma in UICC stage I-III after conventional surgical interventions and R0 resection of the tumor.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, and thus a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
In the total patient population and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of a more precise tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other factors that can be influenced by surgery, in particular total mesorectal excision, for the development of locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, there is still a lack of uniform standards for documenting findings.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in developed countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most common fatal infectious disease worldwide.
In developed countries, factors such as immigration, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, especially due to the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests itself on the skin and mucous membrane.
Ophthalmic involvement is present in about 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The discovery of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Although asymptomatic courses of endocarditis are known, as is the case with other diseases (18, 19, 20, 21), clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since it was first described is increasingly touching on areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear to be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 genetically modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to have a significant influence on the stay and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
The aim of this review is to outline molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for possible applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
It was investigated whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, the first part outlines six research currents with relevance for everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlocks aspects of the six research currents with essential elements of the two models of everyday competence.
A number of experimental investigations and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractional radiation therapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment could therefore potentially lead to significant advances in radiation oncology.
In a brief overview, the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during radiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not yet been proven.
The only method currently confirmed is the implementation of radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour after admission and at intervals of 4-24h with regard to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge with regard to the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression with regard to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24h), age, gender and diagnosis showed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1μg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of AMI was 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24h course, respectively.
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little help for acute infarction diagnosis.
However, the assessment of the prognosis of patients by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4-24h after admission and thus significantly improved.
A 51/2-year-old girl with optic glioma and resulting internal hydrocephalus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content could be found in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disturbance of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier was found to be the cause of the increased CSF protein by means of CSF protein electrophoresis.
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, liver damage with portal hypertension increases the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion-requiring conduit bleeding.
While the diagnosis is simple, different therapy options are available.
In most cases, the source of bleeding is in varice-like dilated vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerotherapy with 3% etheroxysclerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel is recommended.
Resection of the varice-bearing part of the conduit is an option in case of life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the genetically best characterized solid tumors:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known to be species-specific, which are associated with clinical parameters such as the tendency of meningiomas to recur or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression, which is particularly typical of gliomas and results in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also determined iatrogenic by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) for mitral stenosis III 6 years earlier.
3 years later, a valve thrombosis occurred, which required a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become increasingly well understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial cluster by loss of cell-cell adhesion, the invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
Intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenic factors that can lead to degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastasis process.
In addition, when a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will survive only if it escapes the immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is believed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes, the loss of which allelic triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 most often manifests itself between the ages of 20 and 35, mainly through hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have focused on the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different methods of preservation of donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, since very variable follow-up intervals were combined despite long-known dynamic cell loss.
The aim of this study was to perform a long-term endothelial diagnosis on the same dates, taking into account 2 different preservation techniques.
Patients on long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a different risk of perioperative thromboembolism, which requires continuation of prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In the case of elective procedures, the coumarin administration is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively, in the case of emergency interventions, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution arises.
Operations on patients undergoing heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less problematic, as the heparin effect subsides within a few hours upon discontinuation.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
The transfer of the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany results in estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
In order to avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by means of a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of possibility to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent consolidation of the results of the survey of the individual physician groups resulted in a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of those described by Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "MS in question" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
The study examined how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce more growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be regarded as a new promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, the clinical application of which can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the family doctor.
For diagnosis and therapy, the quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of decisive importance.
While in the 70s the doctor's conversational style was regarded as a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversations suggest that the doctor's conversational behavior should be understood as an interactive process in that both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior.
Training programmes to improve basic psychosomatic competence in general practitioners often show little success, as they do not take sufficient account of the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of the Düsseldorf training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
Finally, the training concept and experiences with it are presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All these sources can only be transferred to everyday clinical practice to a limited extent.
Programming the speech processor of a cochlear implant (CI) in young children, especially determining the amount of stimulation that corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation must be avoided at all costs, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds determined at postoperative speech processor adjustment in 27 recipients of three different implant types.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold is an applicable, objective tool for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as percentiles of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed in some cases large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometry.
Thus, it was not possible to determine the MAL and the hearing threshold with certainty and simplicity due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative function check, can contribute to a mathematical restriction of the area to be tested.
However, the determination of the exact MAL will have to be carried out in a different, preliminary behavioral audiometric way.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red parts of a multicolored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was impressive, which could be distinguished from a true lymphoma by electron microscopy, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be a consequence of dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The therapy of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the field of the kidney by means of rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a chicken-egg-sized, budless or areolaless supernumerary gland had developed in the left anterior axillary line for 8 years.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desired.
In connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint can occur.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complications as well as the applied therapy are described.
Before and after endoprosthetic operations, a vascular status of the extremities should be recorded.
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency towards subjective certainty, which, as the subject of psychiatric experience, lose their alienating character with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusion arises are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to update the imagination and increased in psychotic states is a precondition for delusion.
Added to this must be the failure of disactualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by a casuistry, which are based on the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor that was first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing obstruction as a result of a thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor appeared in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
On the basis of an overview of the relevant literature, differential diagnoses are discussed.
The therapy of choice is a complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore present examination possibilities of finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we used.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all subjects examined (n=10).
As an example, it is also shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this size can be detected with the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technology.
The objective of this retrospective study is to assess the need for re-implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery exhaustion and no clinical episode of arrhythmia during the period of operation of the first implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems enables the performance of operations on the mitral valve via a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis.
They are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role in the cause.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the limb parts close to the trunk.
By combining different imaging techniques, the number of differential diagnoses can be limited to a few in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor.
Whereas in earlier years surgical resection had a monopoly position, adjuvant therapeutic measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are becoming increasingly important.
Mutilating interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are justified only in the event of the occurrence of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a temporary exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
In many cases, an exacerbation can be successfully countered with phototherapy, especially by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutics such as glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or is only a therapeutic alternative in a few exceptional cases.
The present casuistry describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented for clarification in the ENT department of the BwK Ulm with a watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-accentuated nasal breathing obstruction.
The clinical examination as well as the CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently started from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected via a midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological work-up revealed the diagnosis of a neurinoma.
On the basis of this casuistry and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor is presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse, but they sometimes lead to considerable impairments.
The most severe complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhages, and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account when indications for chemonucleolysis and when informing patients.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low-impact treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative therapy to systemic treatment with dapsone.
Based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic consultation/liaison services, the effectiveness of a psychosomatic-dermatological consultation activity was examined in more detail for the first time in the present study.
The extent of compliance according to the treatment recommendation was recorded and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as frequency of conversations, predisposition and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics were examined.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action, there was a compliance rate of 78.3%, and a rate of 69% in relation to the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation.
There was no significant correlation with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of conversations have any influence.
In 70.5% of cases, only one conversation was conducted.
A positive attitude towards the consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had a positive effect on compliance.
All in all, a high level of effectiveness could be achieved with relatively little time and effort.
A 29-year-old female patient with an unusual pigment mark on the face is reported.
From a clinical point of view, the pigment lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus, in histological diagnostics the existence of multiple blue nevi could be confirmed, and there was also a slight lentiginous component as well as dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed an expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus turns out to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than can be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in the Starling forces - in particular in vascular permeability - may play a role here, although they have not yet been investigated in more detail.
The discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, in particular about surgery-related complications, e.g. the so-called postdiscotomy syndrome, has led in the past to less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, being sought and used.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on various intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc windowing or chemonucleolysis.
The mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, the automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed since the 70s to clinical use.
The results in patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results, depending on the author and study.
It is striking that the prospective randomized trials that have comparison groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here, the results of the intradiscal treatment procedures are more often assessed more critically and with lower success figures than the sometimes retrospectively examined representations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers, but cannot withstand hard scientific criteria of the study design well.
Overall, it can be stated that percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a part of the lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At this point in time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures have to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their significance when used after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% each.
Hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, larger complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems showed a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all have documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is mainly due to the removal of the airlock immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial occlusion systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macula of the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been pulling the internal membrana limitans (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina for some time now.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and primary dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, undiagnosed first electrocardiogram, prehospital time of >= 12 h, or unknown prehospital time.
In order to describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and primary dilation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died in a hepatic coma 5 days after the onset of the first symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis.
Serological diagnostics revealed a cured hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and a superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis only detected postmortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (above ground) into the pulmonary pathway with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
In 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementias of other causes and 36 cognitively normal control subjects, the tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was determined.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (sum value in the mini-mental state test 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was found in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer's patients, there was no quantitative association between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit determined by SPECT.
The results indicate that tau may also be elevated in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis, especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partly spongiform neutrophilic pustulations were impressive.
The present study describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem after reconstructive vascular surgery.
The underlying pathogenesis mechanisms are the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes.
Decreased programmed cell death (apoptosis) may also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival time of intimate cells, resulting in cell accumulation and hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples from 25 primary and 14 restenosis lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were analyzed using the TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As a key finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In contrast, there was no discernible difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data point to apoptosis rather than necrosis as the underlying cell death form, with differences between both lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenosis.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as usually detected in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
Cytotoxic lymphocytes are followed by a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infectious) endocarditis (IU) can be assumed to be seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been rising continuously for years.
The prognosis is largely dependent on rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the clinical examination, which is usually diagnostically groundbreaking.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the cessation of untargeted antibiotic therapy and verification of the blood culture techniques used, or the application of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potentiating toxic effects are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so that they are usually an independent indication for surgery, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 μg/ml.
In the first three weeks after manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolism is not a contraindication to surgery with a heart-lung machine if primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and the operation is performed early before the development of a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
A significant improvement in prognosis through early surgical intervention has also been proven for disease progression complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially in the wake of acute valvular insufficiency), by the occurrence of acute renal failure, contact infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, as the large, "cystic" cerebral ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections in which either an increased or decreased amount of fluid is found.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act puts the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
Certain clinical pictures in the event of suspicion, illness or death must be reported (mainly by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates which information must be provided by the reporting parties with the report.
It also determines which of these details may be forwarded by the health department.
In particular, in the case of suspicious reports or the reporting of pathogen detection, not all information subject to transmission will always be available through the report, so the health department must carry out investigations itself in these cases in order to be able to transmit the corresponding information.
The health authorities also have the task of bringing together the incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and transmitting them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information that is subject to transmission.
The transmission to the RKI is then carried out via the competent state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer patients usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions that, if inadequate or absent treatment, lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy from various organizations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative care.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases lead to reduced values of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis by laboratory analysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the hemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxious substances, bleeding usually occurs clinically with more or less consumption coagulpathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like constellation of findings and only exceptionally thromboembolism.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after suture-free corneal cataract surgery.
As part of fall prevention, a routine review of medication is required, among other things.
A random sample of 276 hospital patients over the age of 75 was examined to determine how often drugs are prescribed that can increase the risk of falling by possibly triggering dizziness.
Between the individual cardiac centers, the amount of bleeding differs up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after cardiac surgery in adults.
Excessive bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically evaluated in detail.
By avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, the use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol, the use of allogeneic transfusions is reduced.
Perioperative preservation and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at the European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with persistent dedication and great effort.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery provided a forum for the discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to their work, maxillofacial surgery is today, at the end of the 20th century, recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not rare.
However, the spread of fungi into the middle ear can lead to serious complications.
Rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is therefore absolutely necessary, especially preoperatively.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous solution of miconazole.
Three comparator solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for IV infusion, as well as Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical interventions on the eye, were evaluated for their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The median age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As an underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and survived resuscitation in ventricular fibrillation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
A subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted in 25 patients and an epicardial patch system in 2 patients, the implantation site was abdominal in 92 patients and pectoral in 248.
A total of 33 patients (9.7%) experienced a total of 34 tube-related complications over the course of the disease.
18 of the patients with a tube-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of tube-related complications was three times higher for the dual-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators (12%) than for the single-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators (4% (p = 0.05).
In more than half of the patients (55%), the diagnosis was made primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, in a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain) and in a fifth (21%) on the basis of electrical parameters.
The efficacy of radiosynoviorthesis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not mechanically rotate an X-ray tube around the patient, but directs an electron beam to targets arranged semi-circularly around the patient, where the actual X-rays are generated.
With this ultrafast technology, it has become possible to generate axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution <0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cross-sectional images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcification with EBT must be regarded as currently the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen under the condition of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artifacts as well as superimposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary alcifications.
Nevertheless, EBT has already made it possible to provide clinically assessable, non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries, which may be optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has established itself as the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established method of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for the examination of this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients showed a consistent examination result compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic proportion according to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, there is a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial current bed in the form of an increased diastolic flux component.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex ultrasonography were confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularization result postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male, hypertonic patients over the age of 60 years, who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a decidedly rarity.
Here, young patients with or without a history of immediate trauma predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the medial cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The article shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adaptation of old people's and nursing homes.
The adaptation is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and accelerate the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, but it is the task of the management bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions, taking into account the respective framework conditions.
It is reported about a phenotypically female newborn of the 37th week of pregnancy, which died under the picture of renal insufficiency on the 14th day of life.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the end of the 60s, accidents have been among the most common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Western industrialized nations.
While accidents involving older children and adolescents usually occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and early childhood that occur primarily during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the efficacy of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and toddlers in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts are reported, which had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform symptom.
In both cases, there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation, and on the other hand by the fact that only one slice per heartbeat can be imaged with conventional techniques.
New developments in both magnetic resonance imaging and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echoplanar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in a heart attack patient are presented.
The clinical utility of MRI-guided determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary disease is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood flow conditions in ligament ruptures are an essential parameter, especially with regard to the chances of success of a surgical treatment, the vascularization of the inner knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The special blood flow situation was investigated by microangiography on 21 cadaveric specimens.
It showed a supply of proximal by 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which ran preferentially in the ventral ligament parts.
Vascular density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal ligaments, we would recommend ligament reconstruction by means of fibrin bending, which allows atraumatic restoration without the risk of suturation-related vascular strangulation.
Every year, about 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease (about 75% of all heart operations) are surgically treated in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, mainly the saphenous veins, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein extraction techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today saphenectomy is largely performed by means of continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open dissection of the saphenous vein magna.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up treatment after coronary surgery and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desirable results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only minor limitation due to the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal part of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, nipple and mammary.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels can predict impending sepsis and the severity of sepsis at an early stage.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very comprehensive.
However, the online offerings of the various journals and publishers vary greatly in terms of quality and quantity.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including, for example, low production costs and fast, location- and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but will be a useful addition to the existing range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grip".
The present casuistry describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aortoenteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
Preoperative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of preoperative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical therapy procedures, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of the PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents are of the opinion that, from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude PGD.
Against the background of this situation, PGD has not yet been carried out in Germany.
The discussion, which has been going on in Germany for a long time, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
On the basis of casuistries, it was suspected that the muscle relaxant potency of Atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic focus of pus.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective, clinical study.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unclear origin (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C for at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient evaluation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most often hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
In the present work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
With the help of a fast-curing plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, impressions of the skin are made that correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent measurement procedure, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
By means of a statistical program, the metrological data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after applying estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The serum-whole blood water distribution ratio has been set at 1.2 in the Guidelines for Blood Alcohol Determination for Forensic Use for the Conversion of Serum Alcohol to Blood Alcohol.
In an extensive multicenter study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in whom blood samples are ordered in connection with crimes under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21 was measured.
In 96% of cases, the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. In relation to the mean, the deviation of the quotient is less than 3% in 96% of cases.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, it is typically based on the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic clinical pictures of children that change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible through the use of generally accepted evaluation norms.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and by the derivation of the Doppler signal over the wrist arteries.
In the first step, the emergency operations performed on all 10 children included fragment reduction and fixation with crossed K-wires via an extensor access.
The subsequent assessment of blood flow showed a pulse recurrence in 2 of the 10 children (transient, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
In 8 of the 10 children, the pulse was absent, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we saw vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In the case of advential strangulation (2 of these 5 children), the pulse conduction to the hand occurred immediately after the connective tissue, strangling tissues had been severed.
In the case of intima damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with venous patchplasty.
We saw a combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses could be palpated in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal on color duplex sonography, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the brachial artery, radial artery and ulnar artery.
Ischemic long-term damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not found in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees) and a lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The load-bearing joint axis was normal in all children in a lateral comparison.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to pediatricians, since pathogen cultivation is only successful in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--tocopherol acetate/d) against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg/d) in hospitalized patients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis was tested.
After three weeks of treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical parameters was observed under both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and treatment with diclofenac (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90 minutes to 68 minutes with vitamin E therapy and from 68 minutes to 30 minutes with diclofenac intake.
The joint index according to Ritchie decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac).
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E group and the diclofenac group.
Likewise, a significant reduction in the severity of pain was observed in both groups, as assessed on a 10cm visual analogue scale.
The overall assessment of physician and patient on the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even over-inflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic pulmonary processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal rupture and by Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly fell into severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l) within a few weeks as part of intoxication with synthetic drugs ("ecstasy" and "speed").
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolism (HbA1c initially 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party when the first ketoacidosis manifested without adequate hydration.
The clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and paranoia are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The progressions were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff-Cutter prosthesis in aortic position is reported 24 years after implantation.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone-rubber ball of the prosthesis showed pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, groove and cracking with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthesis dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients were treated arthroscopically on an outpatient basis for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus role and monitored according to a standardized protocol after 4 and 12 months.
It turned out that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement to be made about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the foci were located in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, these could be achieved without ankle osteotomy, piercing of the tibia or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes on the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical result make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle joint.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while this is already greater in pulmonary edema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
Nevertheless, the mortality rate of cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 subjects, cognitive impairment was quantitatively assessed after a single oral dose of 15 mg midazolam by using a standardized and validated test procedure (SCT).
The disorders partially corresponded to the clinical picture of moderate to severe passage syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia with no tendency to lighten occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident by the detection of a coarse rotational nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam administration.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for the distribution of images and findings and for video conferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a very good qualitative representation of the extracranial carotid current path in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be visualized without contrast agents.
The use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables a first-pass imaging of the carotid arteries from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s of measurement time during intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
In this thesis, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast medium (CM) injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid return of blood from the venous sinuses into the jugular vv.
First, a model and a computer simulation were used to determine the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space rows.
By step-by-step variation of spatial resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on volunteers and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid pathway.
The best qualitative results were achieved using a double-dose technique at 2 ml/s injection speed.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further investigations into the optimal KM application at the very early state of the art are still pending.
For the prophylaxis of this complication, various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels, including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Postoperative measures include immediate passive extension of the knee joint, early initiation of an exercise program, and regular clinical check-ups.
From the experience of one's own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided if the above-mentioned measures are taken into account.
Within the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical therapy options play an important role.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring the outflow of secretions and the reduction of pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination with the integration of all conservative therapy options.
Thus, in many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present work describes and discusses the current surgical-surgical and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in sick elderly people is one of the most common and neglected diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population examined, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% is reported.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy requirements, such as acute or chronic illness, to a lack of energy and thus combined to general malnutrition.
For an accurate diagnosis of malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable tailor-made nutritional therapy.
The most important deficiencies in sick elderly people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, causes enormous health care costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the number of elderly people, the problem of malnutrition will become more acute.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as a disease in its own right and integrating it into the curriculum of the training of doctors and nurses.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows the ELND as an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor location and gender of the tumor carrier.
In the stratification according to the above-mentioned prognostic parameters, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanoma on the head, neck, chest and acra;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization and with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the arms, legs and abdomen (except acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Applicants for a driver's license are not only required to have adequate eyesight, but also to use it "reliably" from a legal point of view.
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, adopting a head-gaze forced posture or using other compensatory mechanisms.
However, it is precisely these that he is not allowed to do in accordance with the applicable examination guidelines (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with impacted vellus hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient is reported to have asymptomatic comedone-like papules on his face, neck and chest.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally impacted keratin and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be imaged histologically using Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, partly ulcerated nodules.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules and bony changes.
Under treatment with erythromycin, there was a regression of all symptoms of the disease.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column was performed using the thoracoscopic technique.
Due to an increase in experience, the operation times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open procedure.
Our own experience proves the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Significant advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and a shortened inpatient stay.
Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid, intramedullary locking intramedullary nail in undrilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to a narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for the assessment of acromion shape in three-dimensionally reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion shape was compared with the Bigliani classification in conventional X-rays.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis encompasses various clinical pictures that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, no pathogen can be detected in the 2nd group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to recur, have a long course and can also show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to rule out the tumor and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There is no histological differentiation between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis.
In a demographically ageing society, social work with the elderly is not justified per se, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structural change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and has triggered the search for a consensual and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work with the elderly.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L-chains, an early component of complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along the obtained elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the stratum papillary, at the dermoepidermal boundary, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and is therefore also exposed to a high degree of injury.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most serious injuries, very often only residual or replacement functions can be gained.
Complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and bony skeleton with an acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, the aim is to provide comprehensive first aid.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is in the foreground.
As far as possible, the destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced by a pedunculated or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of a long period of alkalinity, this concept is abandoned to the extent that blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of the restoration of vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
When it comes to the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every regained or created function of the hand counts.
It is therefore not justifiable to take care of such a serious injury in a special department without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large, randomized trials with comparable clinical success and risk.
According to PTCA, however, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long-term course, according to the BARI study, the mortality rate in diabetic patients was lower in the operated group.
The individual therapy recommendation by the attending physician has also proven to be an important factor in the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of the newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized trials.
A 34-year-old patient is reported with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata, which occurred after a period of 4 years after pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
In order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes and with regard to their relationship to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases showed characteristic histological changes as well as a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor within both changes could not be confirmed.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without reference to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a suspected tumor lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resectal margin (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and unambiguous as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful on breast excesses:
1) Radiopaque sutures, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
When sevoflurane comes into contact with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthesia circuits, compound A is formed, which could have a nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers to analyze the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
A total of three studies investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% by volume, using fresh gas fluxes of approx. 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from the renal tubule cells in the urine of the subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent investigations then found either irrelevant or even no changes at all in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3% sevoflurane by volume in subjects, which had been administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In any case, the transfer of these results into clinical practice must take into account the experimental nature of the anaesthesia carried out in these studies.
Although the topic of low-flux anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in the volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical studies, suggest that renal function after surgery under low-flow conditions behaves similarly to that after isoflurane.
So far, there is no published experience in the therapy of paraphilias (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in German-speaking countries.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate during a study period of 12 months.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive acts and, according to the patients, there was a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic procedures appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of five different intraoperative warming measures.
Baker and collaborators first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the ultrapulse CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
Today, the diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is possible with almost 100% certainty using both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the examiner.
In Germany, both methods are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has become of paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography is indispensable.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two procedures is practiced as a "golden partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
Chronic rejection is the most important unsolved problem of kidney transplantation today.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or re-epithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogene.
With this in mind, we investigated 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using in situ non-radioactive hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosomes Y and X. In a further step, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are mainly composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association as one of the methods shortening the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
The aim of a survey was to clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision-making aid to determine brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The meeting revealed that the investigators deliberately communicated borderline situations in which in some cases the conditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases, ultrasound was used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further confirm the diagnosis, less often as the sole method that shortens the waiting time.
Microsomal heme oxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32), is solely responsible for the endogenous formation of CO.
In the present study, therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was investigated.
Glycerol leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.
Especially when used in O/W emulsion, it improves layer hydration to a considerable extent that is significantly higher than the urea effect.
In addition, it promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the stratum corneum and thus the exfoliation of the stratum corneum.
especially in the case of long-term use, the deformation of the skin can be intensified by glycerine in the suction test.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerin-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerine also has a protective effect against surfactant action and lipophilic pollutants.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerol, similar to urea, can lead to an improvement in drug penetration.
Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by means of a posterior bone block and capsular plasty.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to prolonged surgery times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Material and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with multi-vessel coronary disease underwent complete arterial revascularization in our clinic.
All surgeries were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, bilateral thoracicae internae in 105 patients (25.9%), internal thoracic artery and radial artery in 299 patients (73.8%) and radial artery in 1 patient (0.3%).
In 346 patients (85.4%), the implantation of the two arterial grafts was performed in T-configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels per patient were anastomosed.
Hospital mortality was 2%.
Sternum wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after removal of the radial artery were not recorded, except for temporary paresthesia.
In the angiographic control 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary anestamos were free of stenosis >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
Low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic femoral fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has become a key part of neuromonitoring, although intracranial pressure does not allow the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron to be registered directly and only with a time delay.
A prerequisite for a reliable intracranial pressure measurement are specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which will be investigated in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functionality and measurement properties.
Partial sphincterectomy is practiced as part of cataract surgery with a very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosis ring of the sphincter pupillae muscle.
While the health-related quality of life of adults has been increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present work, papers published in the literature on the topic of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to focal points and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work has been scarce so far, and the existing measuring instruments for children's quality of life are described.
Increased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the assessment of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were enrolled during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Due to skin changes, which must be regarded as an incipient rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical material, Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasio in 1957.
Throughout his entire artistic creative phase, the artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, especially in the nose area, can be demonstrated.
As one of the founders of Pop Art, Warhol played a major role in shaping modern society with his oeuvre and also influenced our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen), which was specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and living liver donations.
Experience with the program has so far been available for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After active non-specific immunotherapy has had a positive adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves a gene transfer that can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, the following are suitable:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens by means of peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytoking or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro propagated specific T cells, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results could not be accurately assessed so far.
In 309 patients treated as inpatients with conversational psychotherapy and followed up one year later, it is shown to what extent raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales can be influenced by the defensive attitudes of the patients measured with validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and Giessen test:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to appear inconspicuous and normal.
Their relative improvements (effect sizes, rating scales) are smaller as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient psychotherapy strengthened the immune system in aggravating patients and reduced it in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequent surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, about 25% of recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentric reduction and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrence/residual clubfeet (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical procedure is presented.
Beyond the age of 8 to 10, metatarsal osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator and, as a last resort, triple arthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show a marked variability of their clinical morphs.
We report on a 77-year-old female patient with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
For this grape-shaped appearance, we propose the expression "Nevus corymbiformis".
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in transfusion, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthesia procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and mechanical autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, make it possible to spare even patients with large intraoperative blood losses the transfusion of allogeneic blood.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel maternity hospital and the midwifery school, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He focused his research and teaching on the empirically comprehensible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of the pelvic dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis diamond named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness were the hallmarks of his research:
Self-critically, he published medical failures, critically he examined new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis's teaching on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
Out of despair over the death of many patients in childbirth, which he was partly responsible for, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-known conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can be used to trigger temporary irritation effects in circumscribed cortex areas in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for application safety are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that usually occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow extratemporally after and are then noticed extracranial as a mass.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial nerve palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, progressive sensorineural disturbance on the left and mild peripheral facial nerve palsy without deficit of tear secretion.
Neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Using an extradural "middle fossa approach", the tumor was removed without injury to the facial motor nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the major petrosus nerve without affection of the facial motor nerve.
A status epilepticus (SE) is when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, if unsuccessful, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
The refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternatively applicable active substances.
For the treatment of an obsolete rupture of the tendon of the tibialis anterior muscle, either tendon transposition or tendon transplantation is recommended.
On the basis of a case study, the surgical treatment with an augmented reversal plastic is described;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with a good functional result.
Reversal plastic surgery has the advantage that there are no functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies for many clinical pictures.
The main purpose of recording this parameter in intensive care patients is the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies.
On the other hand, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the significance of these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, diseases that are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be becoming increasingly attractive in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the scalp hair.
The medical history showed that all 3 patients bathed regularly in the private swimming pool.
The examination of the hair by means of atomic emission spectroscopy proved an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
On the basis of our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by swimming water from our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different time points after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), Expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by median (Me), mean value (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
already 6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of the transplant recipients felt their quality of life was very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance (87%) and health condition (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients showing a high level of satisfaction with health and 51% with physical performance.
Although the patients rated their mental state as good even before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 months postop.
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities improved in only about 28% of patients after HTx.
90% suffered from one or more symptoms after the transplant, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with end-stage heart failure, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental well-being improve significantly as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite too high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma and a contusion hemorrhage [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-occupying hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP levels necessitated a barbiturate coma for 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic respiratory failure on the 8th day after trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could not be transferred to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive restriction of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction/ Adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
Pelvic overview and computed tomography revealed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV).
The HO were removed 2 years after the accident in two stages, each via a Smith-Petersen access.
HO recurrence prophylaxis was carried out by means of a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/day) for 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection is as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can pursue light activities as a farmer for 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
PCR was used to amplify the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, as well as that of some yeasts and molds.
Hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides led to the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
The restriction fragment analysis allowed the differentiation of the dermatophytes from the yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined using PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected in 35 of the 38 positively evaluated patient samples with PCR and in 28 with culture.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has contributed to the development of a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal endoscopy is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and scapholunar ligaments are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly used in forensic medical practice, archaeology, and evolutionary and population genetic studies over the past decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special reference to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the significance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary studies is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work with the aim of obtaining mitochondrial DNA from ground-bearing teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as our own observations.
Microperimetric examinations after surgical extraction of chorioid neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The surgical effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its high soft tissue contrast, is the imaging method of choice for imaging the intra-articular structures and surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labral lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows the direct visualization of labral lesions by distensioning the joint space and marking the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences enable assessment in the crucial cranioventral sections.
The labral lesions can be divided into different, clinically relevant stages with MRA.
In addition, the visualization of concomitant lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
With the more than 100 arthrographies performed, no complications have occurred so far.
Based on this experience, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we use.
It turned out that the varicen wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the vein wall below a still intact venous valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the synopsis of the mechanical experiments and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and the subsequent varicosal transformation of the vein cannot be confirmed, but rather there is a change in the vein wall and thus also valve insufficiency.
Arterial injuries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischemia may be absent.
Hypothenar-Hammer syndrome is an occlusion of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to a diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
The aim of this study is to test the medium-term regulation of eye pressure after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance with propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anesthesia medications or techniques.
This article will show how best to take advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol regarding the reduction of the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined oral surgery-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous upper jaw by a repositioning osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of endosseous implants is rarely included in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was determined in 23 patients on the basis of the preparation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging with special consideration of anterior aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified on the basis of preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic result achieved.
Profile prognosis with video imaging is a useful decision-making aid when planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, insertion direction of endosseous implants and type of superstructure.
A large-nodular multicenter juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, the unusual clinical and histological aspect of which initially did not allow the diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change from the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, as well as the lack of detection of specific cell organelles, were able to secure the nature of the disease.
For the treatment of rheumatic diseases, thymus preparations, among other things, are offered on the German pharmaceutical market.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as studies that do not allow a scientifically substantiated statement due to the short duration of the study and the small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with a sufficient positive benefit-risk assessment in accordance with the state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the hepatica dextra artery in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to shock symptoms had occurred, the cause of which was more difficult in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapeutic option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insult have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are quickly detected and treatment is initiated within 3 h of the onset of initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number is to be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical staff.
The current standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and therapy of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form with orally administered methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients was compared over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the target parameters were defined as the retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the study program for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and length of stay.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and an average dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a tendency in the retention rate (p=0.06) in favour of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate tended to be higher in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
With regard to the additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, no significant difference could be found between the two during the course of treatment.
Methadone was found to be the more successful substance in terms of length of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and how meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional therapy failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the probability of occurrence of hematogenous metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined for clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node involvement and enjoyment habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed according to the therapy concept after completion of radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage".
Median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%) the disease could be controlled locoregionally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumors, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time of patients with locoregional treatment failure was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/62) of the locoregionally uncontrolled patients, compared to only 4/77 (5%) of the locoregionally cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau after 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indication of the probability of developing distant metastases.
Failure of therapy is caused by the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-slice detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume detection and spatial and temporal resolution in CT is achieved.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current therapy of viper bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 h after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive interventions on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixator was applied in the assembly form A and in 23 patients in the assembly form B.
In 4 patients there was a deep infection, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the Lig were follow-up. patelle in caudal comminuted fractures as well as 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the Lig. patellae in tearing and tearing at the lower patellar pole or suture adaptation of the lig. patellae in the case of intraligamentary rupture, in which no other restorations were made to the knee joint apart from extensor surgery.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients had a strength deficit of the extensor muscles on the operated leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite side.
In summary, it can be stated that EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven itself in continuity-restoring procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint and represents a powerful alternative to patellotibial clawing with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies whose benefits have been investigated in clinical trials.
Based on the casuistry of a 6-year-old boy, hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis induced by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
At the beginning of the light-rich season, numerous haemorrhagic blisters occur acutely in light-exposed areas, recurrent until adulthood, which heal with scarring.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central type of image in X-ray diagnostics in oral and maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic slice image.
The reduction of the dose requirement has also become possible through further developments in device technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or imaging plates.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional imaging methods make imaging using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging unavoidable for numerous clinical issues in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows changes in the cortex to be mapped due to the shortening of measurement times.
For certain questions, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures enable image-based functional analysis.
Today, body-oriented psychotherapy is used in inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients whose body awareness is reduced, who are limited in their emotionality or, due to character resistance, difficult to achieve in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with brief examples, other methods are pointed out.
Among other things, the connection of the affects to the autonomic and voluntary nervous system as well as the close connection of psychological and physical processes, which exists especially at the beginning of life, which connects with the respective experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects, are mentioned as acting factors.
In further development, the body and certain parts of the body also take on a symbolic meaning that is important for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented methods to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Attention is drawn to approaches to empirical research.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence one's career choice and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic activity leaves a great deal of room for the individual to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to implement a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects are described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships as they do to therapeutic relationships with patients.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced heart failure is becoming increasingly important within the patient population with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the therapy of choice for drug-refractory heart failure.
However, the growing disparity between the supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have emerged.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive beta-blockers.
Surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assistive hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plasty, cardiomyoplasty, and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registries.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Bochum, the volume of TLA procedures is compared with the manual therapy procedures over a period of one year.
On the other hand, there were 122 manual therapeutic procedures performed on the cervical spine, thoracic spine and lumbar spine by the respective ward physicians who had completed further training.
While TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture (pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar spine syndromes), manual therapy focused primarily on secondary findings in other spinal floors in patients with the aforementioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of an impacted mandibular tooth from the site of its attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of migration of an impacted lower premolar into the muscular process, documented over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending mandibular branch into the muscular process took place after the completion of root growth, after the patient's 20th year of life.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there any concrete causes for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer and cases that can be curatively treated by radical prostatovesiculectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical specimens determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no standardized method for the processing of the preparations internationally, the comparability of different scientific studies is made more difficult.
The precisely defined, rational preservation of the preparations proposed by us is intended to remedy these problems and help to improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood of requirements for documentation, service recording, profitability and quality control require the use of computer tools in the clinic.
The Orthopaedic Clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen, has been using a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) since 1992, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific requirements of the clinically active physician have been taken into account.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, OR planning (scheduling of interventions, resource planning), OR documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, hospital communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server in MedXS, content and functions can be retrieved simultaneously from the intranet or Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by non-specific neurological symptoms and especially facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukoderma (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered relatively typical and usually trend-setting.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
The therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
In individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM, there is a manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication according to usual therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to screen a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses, resulting in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patellar replacement in the context of total knee prosthetics is generally still very controversial.
In this context, we need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in the prosthetic environment than just compared to the prosthetic patella.
The fact that we have only been performing patellar replacements in special cases for almost 5 years has made a patient body available to us on which this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 knees documented with a 2-year follow-up, total prosthetics, we carried out a survey of the patellar shift and tilt, which was specifically focused first on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar gliding bearing, and put the results in relation to the range of motion achieved after 2 years and the persistent pain symptoms.
An adaptation of the bony patellar silhouette to the prosthetic plain bearing was regularly observed with compaction of the marginal bone contact zone with or without fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" on the basis of their clinical follow-up, as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift above 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt above 15 degrees (n = 3) found.
Within this group, also with a significant difference to the problem-free collective, complaints correlated with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After an axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also became symptom-free and mobile again, without any surgical intervention having been performed on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that a greater effort seems justified for the recentering to achieve a residual shift below 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps during implantation, which have a positive effect on the course of the kneecap, a high quadriceps displacement or a medial refixation of the detached tuberosity may be necessary, for example.
On the other hand, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the non-prosthetic patella has an astonishing adaptability to the prosthetic plain bearing due to remodeling of the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative deformity, in which we had not made a replacement because of good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized kneecap progression.
Whether there is an extended indication for patellar replacement in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for the external quality assurance measures.
By introducing a comprehensive quality management system in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in hospital structures.
So far, the focus has been on measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes.
In order to increase employee satisfaction and qualifications, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
The aim of the operation is to avoid or eliminate compression on the nerve structures.
The present work provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasms.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as the liver, cirrhosis causes increased defects in the respiratory chain.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasias differ pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasms.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are preferentially found in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin lesions in a patient on long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes of this patient are also based on a zinc deficiency of the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic dermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people are compared with each other with regard to their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The examined skin diseases differ significantly from those with healthy skin in the sense of an impaired sex life.
The exchange of caresses is significantly reduced in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is highly significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatics feel more impaired compared to patients with atopic dermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with atopic dermatitis have never been asked about their sex life by their attending physician.
However, despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor of skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sex life.
Even today, the conventional X-ray image must be regarded as a basic examination for the clinical question of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bony inflammatory destruction, but it also allows us to assess their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image of the collateral phenomena is able to indicate a clinical relapse situation and to directly and indirectly depict the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed representation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR - offers highly specific information for some special questions, especially on the trunk skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis, partly also for surgical planning.
This applies, among other things, to the sacroiliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
Nowadays, the treatment of open lower leg fractures of the II degree and III degree with simultaneous soft tissue damage includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
Via the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
It was only through the associated successes that it was possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the hitherto high rate of invalizing amputations and infections.
Initially, these were only individual case observations, but there were increasing indications that these patients frequently had soft tissue problems in the lower leg ranging from recurrent swelling to leg ulcers.
On the basis of a clinical study using venous occlusive plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy volunteers, it was shown that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage ranges from a simple tendency to swelling to leg ulcers, which become more important in their clinical relevance with increasing time distance to the accident event.
In order to avoid further damage, including iatrogenic damage, stringent adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Surgical goal: Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of shape and function of the limb.
Mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a variety of carbohydrate and/or peptide sequences of existing antigenic determinants.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent results also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present work provides an overview of gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including its own findings.
Through the establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany, it has been possible in recent years to network the outpatient and inpatient areas with the general practitioners, internal medicine and orthopedic rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists working in them, as well as the acute care and rehabilitation clinics.
In the long term, rheumatological control centers can contribute to further improving cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatism patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatism patients in the sense of comprehensive rheumatological quality management, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Despite the increasing frequency of medical problems, there is little knowledge about the nature and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical associations of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after surgery of the thyroid gland.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert committees found treatment errors.
95% of the complaints concerned the surgeon, 2% the anaesthetist, 3% both disciplines and one ENT specialist.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine thyroid surgery.
Complications typical of surgery, such as recurrent paresis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postoperative bleeding (3%) and late recurrence (1%), together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodules (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of allegations but 70% of treatment errors.
Deficiencies in the clarification were present in only 11% of the treatment errors detected.
The detection of a treatment error was particularly frequent when a new operation was necessary (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001) or when a complication was followed by an error in the follow-up treatment (p < 0.001).
The area of "Environment and Health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
This is aggravated by the fact that there are sometimes considerable problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform in this field.
Recognized indications are bilateral kidney tumors, kidney tumors in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys as well as in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Through strategic improvements in surgical strategy - such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery - patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors can also be saved from nephrectomy followed dialysis by more than 95%.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of more than 80% after organ-preserving kidney tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are recommending the extension of parenchyma-sparing kidney tumor surgery to a selected group of patients with contralaterally healthy kidney (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears to be low.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrences in most cases is infaustic.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been most frequently described in small cell lung cancer.
We report 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterial skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective, but above all has few side effects.
In the following, a patient is reported in whom pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation was observed in the healed psoriasis foci as part of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
With largely the same technical principles, different lithotriptors have been developed.
In the current discussion are the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence, which make a corresponding metaphylaxis further useful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL alongside other forms of therapy are still pending.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), acute corneal calcifications were observed clinically.
The hitherto unknown pathomechanism prompted us to carry out the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our casuistry, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
various possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, which were first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using polymerase chain reaction.
By using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, displayed on a polyacrylamide gel by means of silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwestern German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741, and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 subjects examined (3.57%), the examination method chosen here, which only takes into account nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
As a rule, patellar chondropathy does not require arthroscopic clarification.
The fact that exceptions must apply is to be proven by the following casuistry.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a football match.
Arthroscopically, it was a firm, nodular, connective tissue hematoma that could be easily formed with a hol .
During the football match, there had obviously been a hemorrhage due to bruise or patellar subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after the arthroscopy, and the muscular atrophy quickly regressed.
Two-thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented that suggest a more long-term effect (longer than one year).
Recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammatory from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop independently of each other to some extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms presented elsewhere at this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express and chain the 1-, 3- and 4-integrins, as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and inter-individual variation as well as different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether AM has functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or whether they represent only "biological redundancy" or only the very last binding protection (final insurance).
The labeling of sperm AM was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in the seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors with a diverse spectrum of action.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an evening rise and nighttime peak between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.
In addition, due to its strong lipophilic properties, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in the extracellular and intracellular space, regardless of a receptor system.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, melatonin has prospects for some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There are some findings on the penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further investigations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics for chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which allow the localization of an inflammatory focus in an unclear focus, since the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and the SPECT technique is given, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which enable the proof of leukocytic infiltration, for example.
Both approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a focus in more detail or which entail an inflammatory scintigraphy in case of unclear findings.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treating capillary infant hemangiomas.
Astonishingly, however, there is a lack of detailed studies to prove their effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial mass due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema formation, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated TBI and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "system response" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multiple organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but can be fatal in their combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic conditions after TBI are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of TBI on the rest of the organism must be contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-induced perfusion disorders can cause prognost-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the currently applied therapeutic measures are still insufficient and require further clarification.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve to sustain life and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This thesis tries to summarize important aspects in this field.
For a better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for the early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids.
Children with facial cleft formation have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 completionists and examined with regard to conspicuous personality traits.
They were also asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for abandonment.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin has been described as an early childhood manifest, dominantly hereditary dermatosis with partially circinary sculling erythema, especially in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal attachment to the winter months and the characteristic histologically multiform findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondoarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the papers reviewed reveal clear shortcomings.
The aim of this study was to examine whether visual acuity decreases as a function of performance time and whether normal persons and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the driving assessment.
Sudeck's syndrome affects a limb after microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck's syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck's syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to an injury or surgery of a limb.
His theory found no supporters, since most of the medical profession is of the opinion that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We carried out various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, methods for the application of fast multi-slice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
In addition to the radiological examination procedures commonly used in dentistry, computed tomography enables a superimposition-free representation of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the already established application of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proven itself in other questions.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of impacted teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the impacted teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the impacted tooth can be demarcated, an orthodontic classification is possible.
In inflammatory dental diseases, horizontal and vertical bone resorption must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic masses can be detected with CT.
Prior to an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
On the basis of case studies, the symptoms of SE are described.
The main symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to the point of coma.
Cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, generalized cerebral edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated immune responses of the organism to bacterial products as well as bacteremia itself are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, and liver and kidney failure may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate treatment of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE is of particular diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy.
Films tell stories.
Above all, those scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts are exciting.
Conflicts of medical ethics do not only appear in medical series or depictions of illnesses, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance movies, gangster and crime movies.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time are seismographs for the social relevance of medical ethics topics.
However, in film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical-ethical case discussion and is a helpful addition to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the rate of restenosis compared to conventional PTCA has led to stent implantation becoming the most frequently performed initial intervention.
Therefore, in stent restenosis - especially the long-distance form - is a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the emergency services.
In addition to the initial treatment of the injured person, the initial treatment of the amputate in the event of amputation injuries often determines the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of imaging diagnostics of the larynx is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not amenable to laryngoscopic assessment.
Consequently, the general rule is to carry out imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical relationships of the skeleton, the internal structures and the surroundings of the larynx will be synoptically represented.
Transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system eliminated the instability while maintaining the function segmentally.
In recent years, new insights have been gained into the post-traumatic changes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals that are intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
Within the scope of this work, the more recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after TBI and the basic pharmacological intervention possibilities are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in different stages of experimental and clinical trials.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease represent a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present study was to test the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease in melanoma patients who have exhausted all therapies.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for over 3 years for pulmonary silicosis before asymptomatic blackish spots appeared on his face.
In the other patient, after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis, gray-black spots appeared on both lower legs.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser led to a regression of the pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The different clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed on the basis of the case studies.
Surgical objective Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area in recent years.
An essential factor is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
Within the scope of this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve was investigated after partial tumor surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascular-pedunculated thoracic longus nerve.
Pressure and pain could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly pedunculated longus thoracic nerve is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in tumor patients.
The use of paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of deliberate overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, but with a large number of overdoses, only a relatively small number of serious complications occur.
Severe hepatic toxicity should be expected in any patient who has exceeded the standard dose and has a minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg/kg (7,5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, any patient whose strength or timing of overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels, should undergo a complete course of treatment with N-acetylcysteine.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function deteriorates.
At the onset of signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in the event of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has considerably improved the fate of a hitherto incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the special facilities for liver diseases.
Background and question.
Itching is a side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases that is difficult to treat.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the bell pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
When applied topically, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological disease that is problematic both diagnostically and therapeutically.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for therapy-refractory testalgia.
12 patients were surgically treated by spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnostics:
The cremastericus muscle is severed by bipolar diathermy, the adventitia of the testicular artery is detached under microsurgical conditions over a distance of 2-3 cm.
With a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is exact, so that a precise environmental diagnosis to rule out a specific genesis of testalgia is indispensable.
In neurosurgery, too, the trend is towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimize preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to keep the risk of neurological and mental disorders as low as possible.
The hospital stay and the inability to work can thus often be shortened.
The main "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
The brain, with its preformed cavities, the cerebral ventricles and the subarachnoid space, offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is occlusive hydrocephalus.
However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular masses can also be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the study was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e., diffusion barriers), a low ADC is to be expected, and in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is to be expected.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanotic lung tumor that had completely closed the left main bronchus and the base of which was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as malignant melanoma.
In the anamnesis, there was no evidence of earlier removal of a skin, mucous membrane or eye lesion.
Even the targeted examinations of the skin and the eye did not reveal any indication of a primary tumor located there.
Thus, the neoplasm is to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far, there is no experience with twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore investigated twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnosis.
Ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging can be used to perform identical pharmacological stress protocols as currently used in echocardiography.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost during organ culture storage.
This study investigated whether this is a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans (LZ) cells.
DNA cytometry has become a routine diagnostic technique that is preferably used in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry for reasons of lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, in 1. Line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in 2. Line also the ploidy, are prognostic and important factors for therapy planning.
A precise knowledge of the method and the possibilities for error is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be considered unclear at this stage.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric examinations and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
In cervical syndromes, injection therapy is of significant importance.
This article deals with general requirements on the one hand and the various practical procedures for injection on the other.
Summary The coverage of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear, although the question of cost coverage by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical preventive services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examinations (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as there are no corresponding recommendations from the federal committees.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to cover costs according to the principles of the legal concept of the so-called new examination and treatment methods may be considered.
However, the german-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be concretized with regard to indication and mode of application and cleared of ambiguities.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the german-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a medical error, as there are still too many ambiguities from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present work investigates the importance of a prolonged corneal storage time for the success of a perforating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experiences with 3-dimensional echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanal studies in a 3-dimensional manner and to examine them for their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients who were systemically treated with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after intensive therapy for a total of 105 days with 72 days of ventilation, had heterotopic ossifications of 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant for severe pulmonary hypertension.
By resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints, a restoration of mobility could be achieved.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatic, after spinal cord injuries, after TBI, during intoxication and in a long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause new bone formation.
The diagnosis is made with the help of imaging techniques.
Prophylactically, drug treatment can be carried out using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both procedures.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), in whom we used the argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-standing skin changes that could not be influenced or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After the application of the argon laser, the area of the treated lesions was completely and permanently healed.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect on LE-related discoid lesions.
In these case descriptions, the efficacy of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is demonstrated for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Reinfection in hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and still requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, the prognosis for the transplant after reinfection is less favorable, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign nonviral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study as well as the existing literature.
Treatment of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception are rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation for pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative claim.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromous or antidromous reentry tachycardias of different incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the conduction system, and detecting other paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident diseases of the heart should be evaluated prior to intervention by means of echocardiography and, if necessary, examination. at the beginning of the procedure with contrast representation.
In 300 patients with certain variants of the pre-excitation syndrome, own results of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a qualitatively better recording of complications in orthopaedics and to have comparable statistics over the years, standardisation of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
Since January 1, 1997, the Heidelberg University Hospital Foundation has maintained a complete consensual register of all early complications of all inpatients.
The complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature and the information is checked, corrected and supplemented as well as classified by the quality management department of the clinic.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard in the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopaedics with the aim of building a consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the area of the acra in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, it is likely to be based on an obligate impairment of dermoepidermal coherence during the course of treatment, which is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of bulging blisters.
Differential diagnosis of acrobullous photodermatosis must be distinguished from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of excessive UVA irradiation or excessive psoralene concentrations.
On the basis of two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture are presented.
In addition to autopsy-confirmed findings of fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology developed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological features, which have been divided into main and minor criteria.
On the basis of the subsequent study on a collective of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the developed criteria will be examined.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in terms of main criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be detected histologically.
T-inversions in right precordial leads as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS broadening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis by means of signal averaging ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of secondary criteria.
Left bundle branch block-like ventricular tachycardias, which were classified as secondary criteria, were detected in 23 patients (96%);
only one patient died of progressive right ventricular failure without proven arrhythmias.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion could be collected in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a confirmed histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without adding histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains as to whether a purely clinical diagnosis is more likely to be possible through a more favorable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria.
Clear data show that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia on cerebral ischemia is controversially assessed.
The conflicting results of the clinical and experimental studies can be partly explained by considering different types of stroke separately and taking into account the time course of blood glucose levels during the acute event.
Hyperglycemia appears to magnify neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia in the presence of insufficient collateral care.
Further, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation during this period is increased.
In contrast, an acute increase in blood sugar by improving substrate supply can protect nerve tissue from structural damage when there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is present in the area of the penumbra and with good collateral care.
We therefore hypothesize that the negative and positive effects of acute hyperglycemia depend on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgery, according to which 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies underwent resective epilepsy surgery.
The localization agreement of findings of non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or had seizures only very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmaco-resistant focal, especially temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG recordings are sufficient in presurgical diagnostics and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
Medical history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented in an external clinic with a newly emerged tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiography, the suspicion of an intracardiac mass was initially expressed, which was to be further clarified by transesophageal echocardiography.
In the ecg, a tachyarrhythmia absoluta with frequencies up to 146/min was found, intermittently a sinus rhythm was also documented.
This was also confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large mass projected onto the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal margin laterally outstanding.
Due to the displacing growth of the cyst with triggering atrial arrhythmias and to safely rule out malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in sinus rhythm and only complains of isolated "dropouts", most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Atrial arrhythmias that appear to be primarily harmless can also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extracardiac or intracardiac masses that require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cranial nerve palsy can have a variety of causes.
A rare cause of paresis of one or multiple cranial nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even in the case of atypical symptoms, is important, since timely anticoagulant therapy can prevent a stroke as a result of dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder's syndrome) as well as the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, deficits of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden cranial nerve failure must also make one think of a carotid dissection.
The failure of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic into old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical therapy of a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as on the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis arose by chance in the course of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of transplanting the coronary artery defect without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was without complications.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, because of the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joints offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result through a small surgically caused soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least an exercise stability in comparison with the standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the low surgical soft tissue trauma, arthroscopy allows the exact intraoperative assessment of the joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries compared to conventional procedures.
From September 1993 to January 1998, a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures underwent arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis in 34 patients.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed good results overall after the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a selected patient, we consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable even for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, after a moderate traumatic brain injury, had bilateral hypoglossal palsy without other neurological deficits, which clinically regressed completely within 3 months.
Since computed tomography did not detect a skull base fracture in the posterior cranial fossa, we discuss bilateral strain of the hypoglossal nerve as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backflow propagates from the large vascular veins through the smallest venules to the area of microcirculation and finally affects the metabolism of the tissues.
As a basis for classification principles, typical clinical features are best offered, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement method.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the basis of arteriovenous short-circuit connections.
In the area of the lower extremities, skin lesions usually occur unilaterally, reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and, rarely, hypertrophy of the limb in question.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerative nodules with a tendency to bleed and infect.
The causal therapy consists in the elimination of the arteriovenous shunts.
Surgery is rarely feasible due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
The successful embolization treatment of a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, which has been carried out a total of 8 times so far, is reported.
Until now, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin has been based not only on the clinic and histology on the H&E section, but also on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on the frozen section (CD1a).
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-compatible markers now also enable a (also retrospective) processing and precise classification of these diseases on formalin-fixed material.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classic cells of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LZH) can be differentiated from other histiocytic cell systems.
In the case of so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LZH), there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-common immunohistological markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown by the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in juvenile xanthogranuloma) seem to have diagnostic significance with regard to the differentiation from Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epithelioid cells typical of the disease process.
In the following, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of administration of allopurinol and after reexposure of this drug.
Verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old female patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
So far, 7 case reports of non-schistosomiasis-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma seems to lie in chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting the conservative treatment options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy organ samples were used to test for NoToX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistological staining, especially for tumor diagnostics, were used.
As a result of these investigations, which were carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX do not differ from formalin-fixed tissue samples with regard to the reproducibility of conventional stains or the visualization of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
To describe the patient's radiation exposure in computed tomography, dose variables such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and the axis dose free in air are usually used.
The CTDI and the MSAD derived from it are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the physician and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose that allows an estimation of the risk.
The specification of an upper guideline value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirements of the study region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities are useful for the characterization and differentiation of different examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
According to a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been newly included in this definition.
As a result, a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpes viruses, appear to be important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and dilatation of the ventricles.
It seems sensible to assign an independent place to shame as a general human emotion in contrast to guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self-sustaining" function of shame should also be taken into account.
The occurrence of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of value, even if it should not be recognizable in the patient at the moment.
The signalling character of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have a disease value is considered.
The consideration of psychogenesis and the unconscious dynamics of shame broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very inhomogeneous both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as in terms of professional responsibility.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response, as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis, has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
Increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL test for the detection of fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to differentiate apoptosis and necrosis.
In an in vivo study and on specially fixed corpses - according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - it was investigated in which position the transverse fascia is located in relation to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In TEP, the fascia can only be used laterally of the artery to reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment to fix foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scaly crusts led to the diagnosis of Scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
It is assumed that the therapy of eczema in the sense of immunosuppression, which lasted for months, led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions with regard to O2 transport and in particular the effective delivery of O2 to the tissue has been proven in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
Genetic and chemical modifications can be used to stabilize the haemoglobin molecule.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
As a remaining side effect of the haemoglobin solutions evaluated today, some vasoconstriction must be mentioned.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation, and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative of the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured patients.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, for which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapeutic component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, special consideration should be given to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication as well as the skills and abilities to safely control complications with intensive care or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapy character should therefore be able to be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthesiologist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this thesis, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for sound-accessible tumors because of its good depth focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be evaluated in carefully planned clinical trials.
In a group of extremely small premature infants, the long-term effects of prematurity on ophthalmological and otolaryngologist status should be demonstrated.
Since 1993, the orthopaedic University Hospital Homburg/Saar has been using an IT system for surgical and outpatient documentation as well as to support the general organisation of the clinic.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS- or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the system has recorded data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 operations.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through a further, clinic-wide network, the University Hospital Homburg also offers the possibility of cross-departmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks as well as the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to test whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
Attention is also drawn to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of the (mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
The aim of this study in sheep was to clarify whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether there is a temporal assignment and whether the results can be used to indicate the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or osteoarthritis marker.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each:
The knee joints of the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects are used as controls (n = 54).
The radiological score values between the groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significant (p < 0.01).
Compared to the control group, HA is significantly higher in the ME and MV groups.
In CS, there is a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial transection.
Clinical consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - possible, to a certain extent a description of the degree of osteoarthritis.
The concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
Therapy with blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In the event of treatment failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockade can be considered as options.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
Additions and use of an epidiascope are described, which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ slices in the courses of general and special pathology and elaborate video installations with additional lighting, etc. Saves.
Narcissistic problems are common in old age and are of far-reaching importance.
These problems are related here to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego ideal in old age.
In three aspects, pathological aggravations of the aging process, as they are often present in older patients, are shown.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the Muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the Muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a high level of success.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chiropractic techniques with impulse.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, which has been known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhea and sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy indicate the diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
According to our findings, a joint occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological diseases.
In developed countries, it is medical conditions rather than food shortages that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly prevalent in the elderly population, occurring in 5-12% of those living independently, 30-61% of hospitalized and 40-85% of elderly people in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A heightened physician's awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The reflected light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
digitiform radial extensions, blue-gray reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/gray background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific reflected light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several individual features suspected of being malignant in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy methods in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently used vectorial transport systems and strategies for the integration of therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical feasibility studies in which such a gene (IRAP) was transferred are an important step forward on the way to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral administration in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic diseases.
These were 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with rodent syndrome and 1 rare case of a midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm.
Older people interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the many opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and institutions for the elderly are called upon to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media literacy and to design virtual learning opportunities that are interesting for them.
On the basis of experiences from the "Senior-Info-Mobil" information campaign, possibilities are described to pave the way for people over 50 to access the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects, it is further shown how spatially and temporally decoupled 'research-based learning' of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a "new learning culture" that also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who are not interested in offers for health and other personal reasons. location.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
In recent years, the rapid technical development of MR tomography has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination procedures.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of simultaneous acquisition of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine-MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic procedure that offers the complete clarification of heart disease in one examination, both as an initial examination and for follow-up.
Due to the rapidly advancing development, existing limitations, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and EDP at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg is given.
Since its foundation in 1967, 4 phases of development can be distinguished:
First medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, implementation of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of the service process.
Planning and implementation were carried out in compliance with framework plans and concepts of the University Hospitals of the State of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal chest compressions.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation into an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee empyma and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium.
The cause must be assumed to be contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem: Six-year-old boy with one-sided type II split foot with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article discusses the current state of the controversy surrounding the indication for posterior surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described as well as the design features of the different types of implants and special features of patellar preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar posterior surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for posterior surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patellar posterior surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is often observed after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensiogenic drugs cyclosporine A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolone.
So far, there are hardly any studies on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" refers to the absence of visible signs of fracture in conventional radiography performed for initial diagnosis in the presence of a fracture.
The diagnosis can only be made in the course of or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations carried out for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method that allows both the early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and the diagnosis of any chondral and ligamentous concomitant injuries.
In the present study, we report 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions who were diagnosed with MRI with a negative X-ray result.
Athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon described at an early stage.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal pathway arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical picture and the diagnosis, which can only be confirmed invasively or post-mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient-year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical interventions or catheterization of the aorta.
In patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with pedunculated and mobile thrombi emanating from circumscribed plaques, anticoagulants proved to be effective.
Embolism recurrences could be prevented and a regression of the thrombi could be observed.
A 62-year-old female patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and extension inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar femoral comminuted fracture is reported, which had been osteosynthetically treated by means of a dynamic condylar screw 2 years ago.
Here, the indication was made for a varying and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis by means of a retrograde femoral nail.
Within the 1st postoperative week, the patient was able to put full weight on the right lower extremity with axial compensation.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable procedure to achieve good and load-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective surgery.
Lacrimal duct surgery at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from the years 1987 - 1992 was examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspect, but themselves not conclusive of carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nucleus size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
In any case, the immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically evaluated and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (if basal cells are positive) reliably rule it out.
In this review, the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 14 days was followed by 20 mg of TNFR55-IgG1 IV compared to a monthly dose of 50 mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, despite the continued administration of the test substance, there was an increase in the inflammatory parameters.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
It is reported about a 13-month-old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested the suspicion of a vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care so that any disorder of postnatal adaptation is detected in time.
The introduction of painless, simple yet reliable methods, such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of increases in resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aqua jogging is a technique that has been used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are performed in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aqua jogging is used as regeneration training and as "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance training.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for diseases of the musculoskeletal system and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular surgery or prosthetic in nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery is the only causal therapy that has its place in a selected patient population.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
Contrary to initial short-term successes, the long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to about 53-55%.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success (on average less than 40%).
Penile prosthetic surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term implant survival rates and patient satisfaction of 89%.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapy option to the last place of the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications such as cylinder defects and perforations can occur with 5-year survival rates of the implants between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal grafts, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our now 3 years of experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly reduces nocturia frequency, while daytime micturition frequency remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also lowered nocturia frequency in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of web sites with radiological information have sprung up and are now available online, competing with commercial offerings.
After the first experiences, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a medium for distributing radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
In the following, from a psychiatric and forensic point of view, we report on 2 cases in which the mothers reacted to SID with exceptionally severe depression and accused themselves of killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are shared.
The review of the cases of 110 children admitted to Burkitt's lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu within a 7-year period showed a preponderance of male over female patients (1,9 :
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that an interrelationship between malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumor.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in initiating the regression of the disease, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of the patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has been a well-known surgical centre.
His direct successors, Kulenkampff and Mayer, have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Zwickau surgery provided important impetus for general and local anaesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organisation, as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures.
After a brief literature review, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the background of early fears of abandonment, there is a renewed threat of being dropped as part of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which has so far served to regulate diffuse inner tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance that can cause pustular dermatitis as an undesirable effect, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after the application of a dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation that is falsely 50 times too highly concentrated in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance because, as a secondary form of hypertension, it can be successfully treated and partially cured in many cases by interventional radiological or vascular surgery.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
An andrological patient is reported in whom the initial examination led to the detection of a high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicle size, which was significantly below the normal range, indicated a pronounced testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couples therapy with doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery phase under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E as well as the trace element zinc, there was a significant improvement in spermiograms.
After another 2 months, intrauterine insemination made it possible to achieve pregnancy with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At this point, the patient only had mild teratozoospermia.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthesia procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy during systemic therapy with corticosteroids are to be described.
In addition to sonography, the X-ray of the pelvic overview is still an indication for the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy.
The toddler's legs are to be kept in the middle position.
Lateral rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
Looking back on 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which most recently took a regression to the 19th century in the "open approach" with opening the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
a sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest X-ray is in the first place.
Profound knowledge of the normal thoracic image and the possible physiological peripartum changes are a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatal thoracic image.
Childhood pathologies:
A large number of congenital and acquired changes faced by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnostics of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect the quality of life in his further life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the main pathologies that the radiologist may face in the daily routine.
The primary tumors were mammary carcinoma (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric carcinomas (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (n = 6 each) and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor involvement (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, and in 51% of the 120 initial resections (n = 61) an extrahepatic tumor was present.
Of the 120 initial resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
Median survival was 20 months after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After second resection (n = 14), there was a median survival of 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without an extrahepatic tumor at the time of first hepatic resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The present results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences may even benefit from second or third resections of the liver.
In some cases, impressive long-term trajectories could be observed even with a rather unfavorable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed about the unrelated act, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communican artery.
For the assessment of culpability, this course of events in connection with the witnessed behavioural problems shortly before the offence therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the offence to be taken into account.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAH.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated into the vitreous.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is suspended and can be repositioned in the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be refixed, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
What kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Since biotoxicity of the PFCL is likely if it remains intraocular for a longer period of time, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
The rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma is reported.
Metastasis occurred after seven years of non-apparent postoperative interval.
In the course of further investigations, no clinically detectable metastases were found.
Taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is nevertheless very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas annulare) of the two plants.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas annulare can ultimately only be secured by a gait representation of the pancreatic duct.
Congenital diseases are genetic defects in which other organ systems are usually affected and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually at the forefront of the clinical pictures.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected with modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
On the basis of the table work of Bärensprung and Hebra it is shown that at second glance they also reveal some other facts relevant to the history of medicine.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presented congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel chest and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The informative value of ultrasonography in bacterial coxitis was checked.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined by ultrasonography.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the femoral head surface and the periarticular structures can be evaluated in the standard incision planes of the DEGUM.
An intra-articular mass (synovialitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule detachment has been sonographically detected in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and in the early stages of Perthes disease.
Since the joint capsule distension does not show any significant differences in the individual diseases, differentiation of these diseases is not possible due to the sonogram in the presence of capsular distension without bony changes.
Bacterial coxitis can therefore not be reliably differentiated from coxitis of other etiologies sonographically;
capsule distension is considered a non-specific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, immediate diagnostic puncture is required, if necessary under sonographic control.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to capsular distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes' disease can be distinguished from both bacterial coxitis and coxitis of other etiologies in the condensation and fragmentation stages.
The diagnosis of the rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in conjunction with clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since in both cases there were unusually highly dedifferentiated tumor cells for gliomatosis cerebri, the diagnosis was complicated by atypical findings such as contrast agent uptake in MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to arrive at statements about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but that, in this sense, good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
A possible influence on anticoagulant therapy by tricyclic antidepressants has so far been evaluated differently.
Above all, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost not taken into account in studies.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with atherosclerotic, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
At the same time, a thrombobendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with profundaplasty was performed in one case, and an angioplasty with stent implantation of the common iliac artery was performed in another case.
The technical and clinical success was given in all cases.
In an observation period of a median of 23 (7-33) months, there was no occlusion or clinical restenosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a less invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary It is reported about a patient who underwent several years of sterility treatment and became pregnant, although she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous pathogens.
In the past, Aspergillus flavus was classified as rather apathogenic to humans.
It describes the case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in the tracheal secretion after aortocoronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit.
The serological test procedures performed, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (Author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibodies, covered latex particles, were multiple negatives.
A post-mortem Aspergillus test with a newer method, antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiographic findings.
The patient died before the use of antifungal therapy, the autopsy showed a disseminated mycosis of both lungs by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
In order to correctly assess the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated, even if there is a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
The epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidences of appendicitis and appendectomy in developed countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforation is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high perforation rate in young children and the elderly shows the low diagnostic certainty.
Analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn about the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After refractive surgery on the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular aberrations can occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
The detection of these image defects under clinical conditions would be an important first step towards the documentation and correction of these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
Until now, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been carried out experimentally for both methods.
Ecke and Hofmann thus came to the conclusion that a comparable stability could be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that this should be preferred because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis for prophylaxis.
By simultaneous-multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations were comparatively tested using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension belts and PDS bandings.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire tension strapping nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, although these methods allowed symphysis mobility beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, the instability increased due to incision of the cerclage and bandings in the bone or fracture of the wire cerclage in general until complete failure.
In the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success depended on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
With the primary tendency of the screws to overtighten, the plate stabilization became more and more unstable under dynamic load.
With primarily stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55,500 load changes with a load corresponding to the average half body weight.
For clinical application, it can be deduced from these results that neither bridging tension strapping with wire cerclage nor PDS banding sufficiently stabilize the ruptured symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial loading.
If the DC plate or the reconstruction plate can primarily be used to achieve safe stabilization of the ruptured symphysis by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with an "open-book injury" can be mobilized with partial loading corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted for years with good success.
Due to the light distribution over several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects due to capsular contracture may lead to a deterioration in vision at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumor was initially misdiagnosed as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
It was not until 17 months later that a 7 cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected by duodenopancreatictomy.
The re-evaluation of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later from an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local application of pharmaceuticals.
The only approved oral substance with proven efficacy at this time is yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with a central target are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine working significantly better than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous applications are available for local application.
As a substance used, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely displaced other pharmaceuticals at the present time.
At present, several promising substances with a wide variety of active approaches and different dosage forms are under development as therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, working with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They alter the patient's state of consciousness and contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural reach.
One of the main long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies summarized under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients experience a temporary stabilization of the disease, in some cases lasting years.
Most of these are results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved on selected patient collectives.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotreated patients over non-chemotherapy or chemotherapy patients.
A survival advantage for patients with objective remissions is assured.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of the current therapy protocols as well as their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates, and the survival benefit for immunotreated patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
As a rule, it should be used as part of clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old) and 239 women (half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
Alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides are included in the calculation of the index.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL quotient, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as an incidental finding during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old female patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings are likely to be due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and localizations of the primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft, it was initially hoped that this procedure would have advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopic and 14 open-operated patients were examined, each preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The scoring systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligamentary stability (KT-1000), the duration of the operation and the proprioception were collected using the angular reproduction test.
The energy dose of the spiral computed tomography and the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the manufacturer of the CT scanner for a dental CT scan has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid gland) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm slices (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid gland) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw specimens were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average measurement uncertainty was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by about 76% had no effect on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the CT scans, which are dose-reduced by 76%, are still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with the clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, allows a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected by histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques.
It was only through the combination of histological, immunohistological and molecular biology techniques that a subgroup analysis was carried out with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative), bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which, in contrast to the others, preferentially manifests itself on the clavicle, can be distinguished.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis that we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as casuistries.
In the differential diagnosis, the primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be taken into account despite its rare occurrence, since it is - according to bioptic diagnosis - a domain of conservative drug therapy.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern drug and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Based on a literature review, the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols is investigated using the example of three major oncological diseases.
Tumor models and the resulting hypotheses and, above all, well-designed clinical trials can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
In this thesis, the in-vitro and in-vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparison of 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in-vivo application.
On the basis of staining of the cytoskeleton and electron optics, the paclitaxel effect in the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall was detected.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and widening of vessel diameter compared to balloon-dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contractile force after paclitaxel administration could be shown.
In addition to an age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytolamsa and basement membranes of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), various manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularizations and pigment epithelial elevations show a splitting of the Bruch's membrane between the basement membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus can be detected.
Recent studies make it clear that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis arise as a result of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the lesion site and the type of vision affection, in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnostics.
For the majority of common dermatoses, there is a lack of suitable animal models found in nature.
Transgenic technology, founded in the 80s, closes this gap.
Initially, it was an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented, specifically dermatological basic research.
It made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses in the murine model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
Transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The availability of animal models of human dermatoses also allows targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in wearers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues, such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses and complaints inside the knee, can be examined better by MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect wearers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by a distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on the safety aspects of MRI in wearers of artificial heart valves does not seem sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on examinations that could not be viewed, or transferred responsibility to the doctor who performs the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, the clinical circumstances and the requirements for MRI safety standards for wearers of artificial heart valves is given.
In an experimental study, intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with an average body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml bolus administration, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), neither of the animals died, nor was resuscitation necessary.
Low-soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma annulare with a known diabetic metabolic state.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoral full-body baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin findings on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Balneophotochemotherapy can have a therapeutic effect not only on epidermal but also on dermal localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (KKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
It was only a few years ago that the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was isolated.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less commonly, there are other organ manifestations.
We report on a 47-year-old female patient who, after a cat bite, developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints, and inflammatory lumbalgia.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint involvement in the context of KKK have been described.
However, since the incidence of Bartonella henselae in cats is high in Europe, it could be a more common cause of joint problems than previously thought.
The diagnosis of KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Through continuous therapy optimization in recent years, the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved significantly.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications, of which the attending physician must be aware.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the quality of life of the mostly young patients is permanently impaired.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful therapy is a significant problem.
Based on attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the aim was to operationalize these patterns appropriately in the sense of their original definition, i.e. as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "safe", "avoidant" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
On the basis of factor analysis results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as binding styles:
"secure", two variants of "uncertain-ambivalent" ("closed" and "clinging") and two variants of "uncertain-avoidant" ("closed" and "willing to cooperate").
The discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions similar to those of Collins & Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and simultaneous radiological evidence of a contrast-absorbing mass of the inner auditory canal confirm the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented casuistry shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellopontine angle, which manifested itself with peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and initially lack of central neurology.
Neither primary radiological diagnostics nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial nerve palsy that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings, as in the case described by us, must challenge to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification despite the presence of leading symptoms.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellopontine angle is considered a rarity.
Other therapy options available to gynaecologists in practices, clinics and rehabilitation include balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or complementary treatment measures.
In gynaecology, balneogynecology as a naturopathic treatment has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
Balneogynaecological and physiotherapeutic measures are to be used primarily as supplementary measures depending on the indication.
Only in the case of chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they particularly suitable for pain reduction and positive tissue influencing as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture is present and subsequent susceptibility testing is carried out.
It takes seven to eight weeks for a negative culture result to be communicated.
Faster results can be achieved with individual diagnostic steps by new procedures such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The worrying epidemiological situation of the risk of infection with tuberculosis throughout the world leaves no doubt that there is a need for the further development of methods which will make it possible to detect, differentiate and test the susceptibility to antibiotics of mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity in the shortest possible time.
Within the framework of a prospective randomized study, a non-joint-bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the treatment of the distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the treatment by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated breast milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who themselves have children born prematurely is preferred for very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day care centres (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centres (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care centres.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on their way of working.
In the present study, 100 visitors from TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptoms and the point of view of the visitors were collected.
Almost all of the visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with moderate severity.
Two-thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had little or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, the visitors mentioned above all the contact with other people and the structuring of the day.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the interference from other visitors.
On average, the visitors to TSn were younger and had higher scores in the BPRS subscale anergy.
Moreover, there was little difference between the number of visitors to the two establishments in terms of the characteristics examined.
The results indicate that both institutions do indeed care for chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration, for which they are also designed.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Limitations and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
Through the use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods, it became possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging sequences can be used to collect information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and permeability of the blood-brain barrier using special models, some of which originate from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, the macrovasculature, temporally resolved, with MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic examinations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be recorded multidimensionally and metabolic processes can be observed over time.
The advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial investigations have shown that the methods are able to sensitively detect pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to place health protection as high as possible in the consciousness of all in the countries of the European Region, also in view of the constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors that are harmful to health are to be combated internationally through concrete measures or, better better, avoided preventively.
An indispensable prerequisite for this is the agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It must be ensured that governments and the respective populations develop a common perception of the important environmental health problem areas.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental" at the Robert Koch Institute in the summer of 1997, with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn. Health).
A 30-year-old patient is reported to have had a right-sided amaurosis fugax with a concomitant frontobasal fracture after a fall event.
CT and MR angiography were used to determine occlusion of the ophthalmic artery as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis.
There were no other neurological deficits, as sufficient blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured via the cerebral arterios.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be taken into account, if necessary, etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
The suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification with appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, an asymptomatic patient was echocardiographically suspected of having an aortic dissection.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other cross-sectional imaging methods to diagnose the evidence of pedestration of the aneurysmatically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out an aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old female patient was hospitalized for acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea and with a picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In further clarification by echocardiography, a ruptured sinus-valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary sail with left-right shunt into the right atrium was determined as the cause in a non-invasive way.
The cardiac surgery was carried out without complications while preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiography, the right heart sections were normally wide, and no shunt was detectable in the color Doppler.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be the result of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
Echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography made a precise diagnosis in a non-invasive way.
Characteristics of rodent syndrome are mandibular and limb malformations.
Mandibular hypoplasia can lead to airway obstruction due to contact of the tongue on the posterior wall of the pharynx, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues were prestretched by extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic result are good.
Airway obstruction and dyspnea were no longer observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thrombobendarterectomies (TEA) of the internal carotid artery lead to improved perfusion in the current area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
Practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice has been largely defined, but it is still unclear whether this independent medical service will be adequately remunerated.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
There is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old patient who had been suffering from progressive effluvium in psoriasis foci at the capillitium for years.
Histologically, strand-like fibrosis instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally encroached on the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and hallmarks of scalp psoriasis were impressive.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important because consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormones (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms, including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely to be due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with the consequent reduction in GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled studies, the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone also effectively reduced SVV in the longer term.
The aim of the present study was to create an osteoporosis animal model by means of ovariectomy.
Before and after ovariectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovariectomy was seen in both the upper and lower jaws.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were arthroscopically evaluated and treated.
The causes of the bleeding were manifold:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from arrodated subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy brought good results.
Toxic snake bite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by adders (Vipera berus).
The adder injects a poison of various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Viper bites in children can be asymptomatic, but can also cause severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings can be displayed over a large area in their environment.
This significantly improves the transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapist who is not present at the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. a tumor, during therapy.
Viruses, for their part, have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in an ever shorter time.
In this thesis, four case studies are used to investigate the factors that can influence an early or late stage of the initial diagnosis of dementia.
In all our cases, we have made the indication for surgery.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily sutured over and rinsed and drained extensively.
In 2 cases, the suture was additionally secured by fibrillation or omentumplasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
On the basis of these own results and after evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions seem to us to be justified:
If perforation is secured in the early stages, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Even in the case of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidney, Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more often.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that rarely have larger fatty tissue components.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which could also have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous proportion with internal calcifications according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different cross-sectional imaging methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlate in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high mortality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
A 58-year-old patient with a 6-month medical history, bloody-purulent expectoration and significant body weight reduction is reported, who was assigned to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
It was only through a diagnostic detour that the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could be made.
This was triggered by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms were quickly regressed and ultimately led to the patient's healing.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of diagnostics in the differential diagnosis of thoracic masses, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors as well as germ cell tumors.
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
It describes the case of a 53-year-old female patient in whom percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy.
Instead, the adjustable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The described technique thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies of benign diseases in one's own test material in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis in relation to the number of births occurs in about 1% today, the different forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as concomitant phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small proportion is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis occurring in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and if pathogen-related mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological tests should always be carried out on the fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in immunocompromised or antibiotically treated patients.
We report on 2, 5 and 14 year old boys with Clostridium difficile-related colitis, without the aforementioned preconditions or a specific underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of such a protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant shortening of mechanical ventilation time.
Both the daily screening of respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and ability of spontaneous breathing are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as there is sufficient evidence that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing attempt.
A gradual discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous breathing attempts have not been successful.
Two randomized trials show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the baseline findings and the surgical outcome in 30 patients with unilateral LKG clefts.
To correct the nasal deformity, open rhinoplasty was used.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal grid photos and the lateral cephalometric X-ray.
Deviations of the nasal symmetry, the width of the nose and the nostril attachment line from the ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was evaluated by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal, and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate air patency.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined, and the flow of the slit and non-slit sides were compared.
The examinations were carried out immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nostril inclination are achieved.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofazial angle and the low nostril was not achieved.
The intervention increased the overall flow and achieved a correction of the quotient of the flows of the gap and non-gap sides.
Through the examination methods used, the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings can be objectified and thus serve as a quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual therapy of the spine from the years 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications that have arisen in connection with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably show normal and acutely injured ligaments.
However, in the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, there is often a lack of synovial fluid, which is necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, as intra-articular KM application distincts the joint space with improved distinctiveness of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the assessment of the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions, KM flushing of the dissecate can be more easily visualized.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free articular bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
MR arthrography, although invasive, provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle joint diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the condition before the occurrence of the emergency.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of trunk varicosis of the Saphenous magna and/or Parva type.
Ascension can lead to migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the mouths of the trunk veins in the groin and popliteal fossa or via insufficient perforant vv, which threatens the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the truncal veins without involvement of the mouths of the saphenous veins of the magna and/or parva veins and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicose veins are only surgically rehabilitated after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes crosectomy, extirpation of the truncal vein via separate incisions, exhairesis of all varicose branches and ligation of insufficient perforante vv.
In type III, thrombectomy via the venous saphenous magna and/or parva mouth takes precedence over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, asymptomatic thickening of the lateral fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
Formally pathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of obsessive-compulsive actions seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms are irritability, restlessness, confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological deficits.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute cerebral organic psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness up to coma.
The initial cranial computed tomography showed a discrete, general brain swelling, which regressed regardless of the clinical deterioration.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography showed generalized increases in flow velocity (medial cerebral artery, anterior and posterior on both sides, and basilar artery).
The causal relationship between increases in flow velocity and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of the flux velocity increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow-up of the anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although replacement plastic surgery is the gold standard for the treatment of cruciate ligament injuries, autologous reinforcement reinsertion in adolescents is an excellent option.
We report on the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
This was preceded by a blunt chest trauma in the context of a traffic accident.
Computed tomography (CT) could not diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be required if possible to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are then categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes differ considerably from them.
This brief presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a well-founded decision-making aid for his own practical work with regard to many everyday, but by no means trivial problems.
A 57-year-old female patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgbxmin over a creep phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in the inflammatory parameters, the lung function, especially the diffusion capacity and the pronounced acral circulatory disorder.
Due to its central location, the elbow joint is to be regarded as the most important joint of the upper limb from a functional point of view.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the attending physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and restricted movement, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today, there is little doubt that in the majority of cases, a primary definitive osteosynthetic restoration with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercises.
With an increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient of subcutaneous electrode sections palpable through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode progression and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was successfully used in patients with psoriasis as early as the 70s.
This review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes the current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility of analysing structures with tomographic precision in individual steps.
Image planes that cannot be displayed with conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes also allow a three-dimensional representation of stored structures.
With these different imaging options and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 h on the first postoperative day.
After transient paresthesia, burning pain in the legs occurred as a result of the accidental infusion, combined with motor and sensory innervation failure up to segment TH 11.
Complications such as those described are usually based on errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include color-coding pipes, filters, and infusion solutions, as well as the use of syringe pumps with a larger reservoir of medication to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The observation of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology so far.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of ridge height and width, 95 edentulous bony upper jaws were first analysed from collections that had been sawn, measured and classified in a standardized manner.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and evaluated differentiated according to implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was followed in the clinical part of the study in 24 consecutive implant patients with edentulous upper jaws.
Implant insertion on the mortuary jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but was actually to be expected in a further 4.5% if the jaw height was sufficient.
Implant length reductions were necessary in an additional 6%.
There were dependencies mainly on the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered much more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, none of the 24 patients were implantable.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times a transversely too narrow alveolar ridge was found only during the operation with sufficient height.
The results allow the quantification of the significance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimensions.
This importance is primarily due to the bone height, although reductions in the implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, both the cadaveric jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and the patient (8%) remain alveolar ridge profiles, for which the sole height measurement simulates incorrect conditions and a precisely planned surgical intervention may have to be aborted.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the scope of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes and non-morphological changes.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, they can be detected by radiolabeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven itself in various tumor entities.
In this study, PET was examined in lymph node staging of bladder cancer.
In 64 patients, a PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after IV injection of fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG), so that the PET findings could be compared with the histological findings of the surgical specimen after classical surgical lymph node staging.
In lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than the classic staging procedures, such as CT and MRI.
From 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had total subnormal immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If, despite conservative therapy, chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist, a mucosal-friendly sinus operation is indicated, which, however, cannot bring the desired success in this clinical picture alone.
An immune subclass deficiency is to be regarded as an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions into severe immune deficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old female patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk as well as on the right leg in the course of Blaschko's lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
When treated with acitretin, there was a marked decrease in lesions.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the "palschkitis of the adult" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectum resections has increased after nerve-sparing dissection and complete excision of the mesorectum have become widespread.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinary incontinence are between 25 and 67% in the literature.
Material and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were visualized on 10 cadavers and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic specimens.
Their positional relationship and possible damage sites were depicted and photodocumented in the course of surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically well-defined structures with only little interindividual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense network of fibers around the trunk of the inferior mesenteric artery (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectal wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated by standard surgical access.
1. The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly clarified in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close positional relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes a sharp dissection under direct view unavoidable.
4. Fascia and nerves can be used as lead structures in the preparation.
5. Selective sparing of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via standard surgical access.
The early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is important for the prognosis and groundbreaking for therapy planning.
In a prospective study from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx and lip were panendoscoped as part of staging in order to test whether this method is possible for early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso, oropharynx and hypopharynx.
The final step was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous secondary carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precancerous conditions could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary carcinomas in a primarius in the "head and neck area".
Due to the good experience so far and the complication-free course, this examination obviously does not pose any additional risk to the patient, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's disease can cause significant problems, especially at the beginning of the disease, due to the high variability of the clinical picture.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's disease, in which psychopathological changes were the main symptoms for 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
Unusual and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis were the very early onset of the disease and the significant advancement of the onset of the disease compared to other sick family members.
However, the phenomenon of bringing forward the onset of the disease is well documented in the literature in the case of transmission of the mutated gene from the father.
Differential diagnosis was groundbreaking in the attention of the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed collection of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focuses:
as climatotherapy, as (balneo-)phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain patient groups benefit differently from this, indications for psychosomatic treatment are worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological origin or with psychological involvement, if depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation are present.
In the case of problems in coping with the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, the importance of orthopaedic aids such as bandages and orthoses for functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle joint will be described.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influencing athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene pans of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of changes in the shape of the polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion can be detected by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first few years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it settles down to values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to prosthesis loosening.
In this study, in a total of 369 hip prostheses, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the marking wire of the socket and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average life of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
In the case of the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was only achieved in 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The polyethylene-ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene-metal pairing.
For younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
If there is an indication for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who are unable to give consent, the approval of the caregiver to carry out the curative treatment is required.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had assumed that there was a justified risk of long-term damage to health and had affirmed the requirement for approval.
However, electroconvulsive therapy, subject to the observance of contraindications, is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis.
The use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs only very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the dangers posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, a guardianship court approval requirement within the framework of the Care Act is to be denied.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine, among others, in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance.
The in vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the protocol of the European MH group represents the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH predisposition due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene was detected in an individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the rest of the family members and the agreement with the IVCT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnostics of malignant lymphomas in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system diseases of the child are relatively uniform sonographically:
initially, lymph node and organ enlargement, as well as disturbance of the normal echotexture, are usually found in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
On the parenchymal organs, essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed sonographically:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "bulcky type".
Therapeutic success can be seen in ultrasound by the normalization of lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity and the regression of tumor or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic clues are derived from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, with some reservations, from the echogenicity and the blood flow conditions that can be analyzed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
Background and question.
In transient acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, clinically mostly itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles are found predominantly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
With an etiology that is still unclear today, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
