Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new national coach
In summer 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The “Geesthacht blossoms on” campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. “Geesthacht flourishes” is an action by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the ground since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthacht urban area, extensive flowering islands are to be created, on which insects can find food at any time. “When the weather is favorable, bees fly out to search for food as early as January,” says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the endeavor not only remains an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental services, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant specifically at home.
The Wildhasel season started in the first week of January
More recently, shrubs such as winter cherry and winter snowball are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently received further signs. “The winter-scented cherry is a very broadly bushy shrub and can reach between two meters high and three meters wide,” it says there, including further information about the appropriate location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that, however, it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. The Wildhasel season began in the first week of January. It flowers particularly profusely on the Richtweg on the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: “Stepping keeps me young”
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at the “Mandolin Motion Show Academy” at 3 p.m. for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102th birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh,” Monday is THE highlight of the week. “Dancing and tapping is my life, I can't imagine myself without it.”
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was rescued in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say a musical performer, working with the legendary Marika Rökk. “I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing.”
At 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: “We're just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl.”
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used initially, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French term claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a highly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. “We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here.”
And what is the recipe for such a long life? “The movement keeps me young,” the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: “Sport, healthy food and no alcohol.”
Analog in dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, some people are once again interested in analog
The rapid pace with which our everyday lives became digital left us with little time to set rules for dealing with them and to adapt our communication and working methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. You were either one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic hopper and the clicking of the small change coins in the vending machine will never be forgotten. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when I called - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was met with hostility from pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her “enormous sacrifices.”
Moldova is a neighboring country to Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the celebs' costumes
2023 will once again be properly celebrated in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not allow themselves to be asked for long.
Country father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as Bayern's tribal elder. At his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and Mrs. Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely aloof: Minister of Science and Arts, Markus Blume, is heading into space.
Landtag president Ilse Aigner chose none other than “Mama Bavaria” as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to crafts with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same for him.
Of course, the political opposition could not be absent either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-boss Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
Hiking is what SPD parliamentary group leader likes: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, I'm sure he'll talk more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side, Mrs. Andrea.
Should politics no longer work out, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermine.
Traveling quickly as a bee: Bavaria's Minister of Digital Affairs Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR Legal Director Eva Majuntke, BR Director Katja Wildermuth and BR Culture Program Director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side swipe against the climate activists by Franconian Tatort Commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be absent, of course. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint
Boe continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even sometimes heavy fog did not prevent long-term winner Boe from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it was already enough to successfully defend the title with Norway's mixed relay.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Boe is once again the clear favorite. Its running form is outstanding, so that it can compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent shockingly easily.
In the meantime, Doll didn't come together again. After the veteran had lost all chances of winning a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things didn't get any better three days later. Three penalties already in lying down and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he won surprisingly by 0.7 seconds ahead of Boe. It was one of only three of Dolls career successes that has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: “We must stand up for democracy”
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on maintaining democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
“The strong democracy of our two nations was put to the test,” Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.” With regard to his right-wing predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, Lula responded: “Brazil has isolated itself for four years.”
The left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grim reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor had not paid much attention to international relations. “His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,” said Lula. “Sounds familiar,” Biden replied — an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF search posters? It looked at the members of the Red Army Faction, who had been approved for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstriped suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis on the S-Bahn trains or masturbators in the park, is launching a new edition featuring the “war criminal” Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are perhaps more “Russian friends” in this world that Asia, Africa and Latin America belong to than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's: In 1st to 5th place (!) Mrs. Wagenknecht stands, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the usual level, where nothing is lower.
And now at the latest, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And differentiation is no longer necessary here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have split up. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the “Bild” newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: “I can confirm that my client has filed an application for termination of his civil partnership with the competent court through his family lawyer. I won't comment on details.”
Glööckler and his partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and there had been separation rumors for about a year. After participating in jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also talked about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was set up in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended France's values, said Macron. He had also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve for 14 houses: Everyone knows everyone in Homeien
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorbikes a day drive along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even drive right back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are “absolutely” necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. “Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs may rise again slightly, and the opening up of China may also give prices a temporary boost,” Sewing told the “Welt am Sonntag.”
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher credit interest rates can result in investments being postponed and therefore economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro countries such as Italy. “The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,” said Sewing. “Of course, we must keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently.”
In the medium term, the ECB aims for price stability in the euro area with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce consumers' purchasing power because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply higher energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will “collapse sooner or later,” warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federation of German Banks (BdB). “I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I'm optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the “pace of Germany” for infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). “There will need to be a political and social dialogue about this. And it may also be a bit more controversial,” he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that, in the end, a set of rules will come out which, although not necessarily as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year, will not be as slow as before.
After ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened in mid-December. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to a certain extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new “Germany pace” on the occasion. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
“First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that shouldn't automatically mean that we will always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will,” said Hartung. There must therefore still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, people have tried the classic set of rules and failed. “We should think again about whether the previous approach was correct. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.”
However, in view of the many outstanding tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. “As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.”
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
Following an announced change of head at Bayer, the chemical trade union IG BCE is warning of the Group being dismantled. “From an employee perspective, Bayer, with its three pillars, is just right for the challenges of the future,” Francesco Grioli, member of the union's board of directors and Bayer supervisory board, told the “Rheinische Post” (Saturday edition).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. “The transformation of industry can only be mastered with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability — and not on hedge fund activism.”
The background is the change of head at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals for Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The takeover of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the people of Leverkusen had brought expensive legal disputes over the alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer shares have been falling for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It was known for a long time that Baumann was not seeking an extension of his contract, which was actually supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the Group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. Spin-off “of the Consumer Health division would be one possible way of increasing the company's value,” Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the “Rheinische Post.” On the other hand, he does not believe that a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
paris
On Saturday, too, the French want to take to the streets against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions oppose a government project with concentrated protest on the street. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform once again on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people across France are once again expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the central government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. There has been a turbulent debate in Parliament over the controversial reform for a week.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid long enough for a deduction-free pension by the time they reach the age limit. In many demanding occupations, people could hardly work longer, say opponents of the reform. In addition, employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-earned pension and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the pension level to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government doesn't just want to work on retirement age. The increase in the required payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was canceled, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. A number of presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - broad protest and strikes were certain of everyone.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicains, who have announced support. However, some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be even greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they were calm and did not result in a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A huge high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is plenty of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. “When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly above Central Europe immediately catches the eye,” explains meteorologist Markus Uebel from the German Meteorological Service on Saturday in Offenbach. “It is true that this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, it still determines the weather in Germany.”
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Uebel. “Such a high can even be pretty mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high-fog grey for days on end, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges.”
As a result, Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a bit from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up over the course of the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or overcast. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
“On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high fog again and will be able to dissolve it more and more over the course of the day,” says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day; elsewhere, it must first fight its way through the blanket of high fog. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees in the Lower Rhine, but only 3 degrees are expected in permanent gray in the southeast. In addition, weak winds are blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, there can once again only be tough release of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be bright after fog has dissolved. According to forecasts, the sun shines all day in high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees.
Dominator struggles: Once again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia has shown herself severely disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Meribel
“I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can,” said the Italian on ZDF after she had scored a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was barely able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, must continue to wait for a World Cup medal in her prime discipline. She was absent from her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second,” said Goggia now after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. “I'm disappointed. I did everything I could. But that's life.” Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: “But they aren't.”
Girls missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information about their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in the search for a missing child. 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children towards the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30pm on February 10, 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local language.

Zelensky and minister against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. By calling for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
During a joint conference call, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
“We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues,” said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. “And I have made Great Britain's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. “While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately drenched in blood and is not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which “unfortunately has lost its honesty.”
The occasion for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it would enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior is also taking a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sport then stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. “In our opinion, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a DPA request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: “Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events don't take place in a vacuum.” Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for athletes from both countries to return to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly subscribe to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that exclusion “because of a passport or place of birth” violated the prohibition of discrimination.

Lost half of the vehicles? : USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. We're talking about “half of the main stock.”
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. “Probably half of the main stock of tanks” in the Russian army was “destroyed or seized by Ukraine,” said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed in US estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev that it will deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other states, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take significantly longer.
Russia wants to add more
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev offered the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. “As we know, our enemy has begged for airplanes, missiles, tanks abroad,” said Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to an armored factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. “It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks.”
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more focused on the needs of the army. This can oblige individual industries, for example, to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil for filling posts at Heer
This is because the post that the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
According to the minister, a call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously unfilled job. She did not want to comment on “speculation by a liberal personnel representative.” Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been eliminated.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the Monarchy Wars, but the Institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the “unusual ordering process.” The decision is based on the “appearance of Postenschacher,” says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to rescind the appointment. The ÖVP is “still stuck up to its neck in the corruption swamp,” said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival procession. However, the higher security costs, among other things, are difficult to manage even in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone accounted for approximately half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The “Train of Happy People” in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in Eastern Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Alemannic Shrove Tuesday, no parades were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's Marne carnival stronghold is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. “We are holding our event,” says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claussen. But financial concerns are pressing here too: If more sponsors were not found or the previous sponsors added even more, reserves would have to be affected - “that doesn't work every year.” The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: There is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for sweets, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Procession Friends Association. Due to luck in misfortune, too many were ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will be more expensive. Security requires twice as many personnel as in 2020.
Anyone standing by the wayside on Rose Monday procession in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't carry as much with them. Camels or not, the number of visitors is likely to be high: “I think that if it doesn't rain out of buckets that day, then we can certainly expect an increased number of people,” says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. “This is due to the fact that no regular Rose Monday procession took place for two years. There is, of course, no substitute for the train.”
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally “loss-making,” that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and homemade vodka
It is not for nothing that Ukrainians are considered to be drinkable. There is local beer, such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other major breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell much of a difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes on sale en masse. There will probably also be adulteration there.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for their hard work: “Good match luck on our side”
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer after work, Rostock and Warnemünde are great places for that. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-heating for club parties. Where is it best? A look at Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed to the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot “Flocke”
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the award of medals in the Oberhof World Cup sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
As hard as the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range actually fell. “I had to get the results on my cell phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the fog that repeatedly swept into the stadium, which severely impaired the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: “Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the biathlon,” he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: “The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say that too - thanks to those who have worked here since the World Cup was awarded.” In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now “one step ahead” of many others and therefore “safe for the next few years and even decades.”
Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Boe once again separated from the competition in terms of sport. Despite a penalty round following a shooting mistake, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawlessly shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Laegreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the battle for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after a shooting mistake and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow scored flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed once again. After his failed mixed mission on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five windows standing this time and disappeared into the cabin as 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Boe started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and demonstrated this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he was lucky enough; they each landed on the edge of the windows and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: “It feels the best to be here with him,” said the world champion: “We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes.”
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. “If you start with number one, the goal isn't to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend number one,” said Sports Director Felix Bitterling, taking charge of his “locomotive.” The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25pm and 3:30pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeases “bee swarm” on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to “consistently punish” unsportsmanship. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the pitch. “I think that there are new players' behaviors that surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area,” the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. “We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this again — and will also sanction it.”
Recently, two coaches had also received referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. “Coaching behavior also falls within the scope of unsportsmanship. We noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, and that behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanships,” said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out the generally good cooperation between coaches and impartial players. “Overall, the ratio is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlashes. The person concerned must then live with that. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering,” Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
“Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts over the course of the game. But if the emotion spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by referees,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved would have settled things out afterwards. “It would only be important if an overall rethinking process were to start, that such behavior simply is not appropriate,” said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out potential effects at other levels. “Of course, events from professional soccer always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently responded to negative behavior,” said Fröhlich. “Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying discussion with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful.”
Combined team Oftebro wins in Schonach
After jumping off the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia finished third.
The German combined teams are not in the best line-up in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. With training in Oberstdorf, they are preparing for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. “We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels that, of course,” said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a police report, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a car driver hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have created the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are a few extras for the finale.
The closing of the exhibition “Wandgebunden” will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 15:00 in the transition quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a presentation on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous pictorial examples, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the lines of connection to this art form in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate on wall painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art and the history of art and institutions in the post-war period in Germany, most recently with Sebastian Freytag on architectural art in NRW. The presentation will be followed by the last curator's tour of the exhibition. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants following building collapses in Turkey
It concerns construction defects that have promoted the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. Arrest warrants were issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officers. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have promoted the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine more people were therefore arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 struck the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake of magnitude 7.6 at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Second to last prime minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the left-wing faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politician as a “deeply sincere socialist.”
Last night, “Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95,” the left-wing faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is thus losing “an important figure,” explained parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He was succeeded as the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a “profoundly sincere and militant socialist.” Bartsch added:
“He was an important advisor in our party until old age, whose wisdom will be lacking.”
“The entire peaceful process of establishing German unity was precisely one of his particular merits. That will remain his political legacy,” Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
“His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always included representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.”
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state “quite critically.” According to the DPA, German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and too unilaterally it was condemned as an “unjust state,” according to the DPA, Modrow had criticized in many interviews.
What happened during the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev — The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants were damaged, said the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The situation is particularly poor with the power supply in the Kharkiv region. Because of the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was cut at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during its trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky doesn't want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, there will be war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger posed by Russian rocket attacks persisted even on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alarm was triggered for the fifth time for the day late on Friday evening. “There is a threat of an attack with drones,” the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-style combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects advisors for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not have to generate and transfer any profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The backlog of rehabilitation on the rail network is a major reason why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of remedying this shortcoming by completely renovating entire rail corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railways, however, they are more likely to amount to up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
The external circumstances apparently did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had a bad night's sleep, she said after the race, was “really excited,” and her pulse stopped coming down when she arrived. “A race like that,” and that at the home World Cup, “you can't describe it in words,” she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming hit music with German flags, coaches and team hugged each other.
“Enjoy biathlon,” that was her goal
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Cup as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She is currently in fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the power density among women at the top is significantly higher than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were others on the cards for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely tense since 2018. Back then, demonstrators calling for Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same, as the “Welt am Sonntag” reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. “There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to potential savings requirements right now,” says a response from the Federal Government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The reason for the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was decided by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these increase, there is therefore less money available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is falling as a result of the current high inflation.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured people
During the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit towards Heilbronn onto the motorway. At this point, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 towards Künzelsau, according to the police. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident was “green” for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totalling around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart remembers the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart responded to the appeal of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is great sympathy - even in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disasters in Turkey and Syria are occupying the world. On Stuttgart's Schlossplatz on Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them.
Many community members had responded to the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's supplication seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam Allah asked for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection against plagues and respectful treatment of one another. The community also asked for help and strength “to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake.”
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the families of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial service. The supplications on Schlossplatz were also translated into German.
Muslims in Germany show great solidarity with earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamische Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind on Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat insert - Ebersberg
“After dinner, you should rest or take a thousand steps “... The older people know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because thanks to the home office, anyone who is not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, woods and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk out into the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburg, where it's not just dog owners who are bustling around between 12:00 and 14:00.
One reason could, of course, also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things as part of optimal use of time slot. Because why not find out news about the settlement from the neighbor who hasn't been seen for a long time on a short walk through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It is also possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
Another excellent thing you can do is buy goods in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, which is on a roadside table with cheese. Or potatoes and meat. It's just stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voice. “Too bad, unfortunately we forgot the money.”
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet yourself, but not a transport container. What you also let the friendly random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: “But that is not true! You certainly have a bag with you!” He points at the hood of the jacket, which you have quickly put on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headpiece unnecessary. “My wife always packs everything in there!”
And so it happens that you start your way back with a meat insert and have not only gained the back of a lamb, but also an extremely practical idea during this short lunch trip. It is quite possible that a second walk will be required on this day - after dinner. Actually for digestion this time.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road towards Hailfingen and turned right off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, hit the side of a tree and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured person to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of incapacity to drive, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. According to the police report, the Audi suffered a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as president of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump had made his tax return public neither as a candidate nor later as president. He defended himself against surrender up to the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a lawsuit.
Issuing it to Congress is probably more tricky for Trump: There, the number of people with access rights is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is also repeatedly leaking out of Parliament.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a “victory for the rule of law.” Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. “The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president,” Pelosi said.
Cabaret in Bastion: Life Plays Between Birth and Death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract with the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or?

Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about life situations in a humorous and thoughtful way. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the point - and there are also a few things between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30pm at Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after a long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been arrested in Thailand. As the British Criminal Investigation Department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the “Most Wanted” list of the most wanted criminals by the NCA.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a court case in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret - Tales from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a spear for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo “Make Science Great Again” fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism here. In any case, his sense of humor fits very well with Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do — and above all not what it can do. There is corona, of course, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but you can also learn something new in the process.

1. General
The BATTLEZONE one-man entertainment device is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game shows combat from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. There are rock pyramids and rock squads on the valley level, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit as the game expands. In addition, UFOs also appear at regular intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction process, the game initiation process, the game abl, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test process. The latter operating mode is a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game process is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds are audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left information display angle of his cockpit. A clue may, for example, read: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a dot is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar blip sound, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the enemy is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRE AREA are also shown on the upper left information display at the same time.
At times, UFOs become visible on the screen, which fly over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that monitor combat action and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs should round off the combat action and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the installer the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game process. Furthermore, after reaching predefined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the gameplay selector for this setting option are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of highest scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the game is over. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that when you trigger a self-test, press the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupt the power supply, the table with the highest results is deleted. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores will be received with their initials and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players. Any score above 100,000 is also marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically inscribe lines. The device then switches back to the attraction game process. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI gear lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly bring the control lever into the center position. The microshafts are now secured with self-locking nuts to make them easier to replace. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y gaming circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and quiet image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased energy supply caused by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. The device also has a console, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make gaming easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment inspection
Once the packaging is removed, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should do a certain amount of verification to complete quality control. To be certain that the device was delivered to you in good condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. For example, open the service cover of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for a correct and secure connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never use force to establish plug connections. The plugs are fitted with forced guidance so that a correct connection is made. A plug connection twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the connectors to the game PC board for a correct and secure fit. (3) Note the device's serial number on the type plate on the back of the device. Verify that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Regulator/Audio II PC Board, and the TV Monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number is on the back of the cover of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for correct installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with power supply and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also in the bright, orange-colored opening of the fairing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be released and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Figure 3) matches the local power supply. Check the color of the cable on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? The following are a number of tips that can help you solve most issues associated with current DirectX games. Verify system configuration
Please take the time to verify that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX diagnostic tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. To launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, please follow these steps: Click the Start button and select Run. Type dxdiag in the text box. The DirectX Diagnostic User Interface is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound cards. Among other things, you can verify that graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you don't have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs consume the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called “background applications.” In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. We therefore recommend that you close such background applications before you start the game. - If your system is running antivirus or crash guard programs, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, find the program's icon on the Windows taskbar. Right click on the icon and select the appropriate option (“Disable” “Close”, or similar). - Once you've disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to close all unnecessary background applications.” Clean up the system
Before you install software, make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to “clean up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games run largely without problems on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and therefore other applications that you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk, or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and select Help (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Error Check (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup. You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. The following are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing CTRL, ALT, and DEL may not display the Windows security window, but the Windows Task Manager immediately appears. Windows XP Home
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETE. The Windows Task Manager is now displayed. 2. To close a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate task list item, and then click the End Task button. Before you call the hotline
If you want to call, sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see “Checking System Configuration” section). Please also prepare notes. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98; Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - Information about graphics and sound cards and drivers
INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up tons of new opportunities and appeared to me as a new means of expression that could be used to push the world to its limits. For me, it was an opportunity to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on “action” and forgot a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits feelings. Even though this could of course have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammo, but also has far more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help you change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us time and again to question many of the principles previously considered irrefutable. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit — like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you — doesn't pass you by without a trace either. David Cage
THE README FILE

Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than “D,” use it accordingly. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish installing the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. When installation is complete, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and select Applications/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. Note: The Fahrenheit DVD-ROM must be in the DVD-ROM drive before you can play.
This SERVICE MANUAL is intended to familiarize you with the installation and maintenance of the QIX TV entertainment machine. In addition to important information on installation and maintenance, the game process is described on the front pages. The subsequent service tips require general knowledge of microprocessors, TTL circuits and TV monitors. Without knowledge in these areas, no attempt should be made to repair the electronic device part. The electrical plans form the conclusion. We ask you to carefully follow the instructions in this manual to ensure satisfactory operation of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL are current at the time of printing. SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LINE WITH TECHNICAL PROGRESS, BUT NO RETROFITTING OBLIGATION! Please note when setting up
Transport damage
If external transport damage is visible, it must be complained about immediately, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railroad, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Line voltage
The device is set for the power supply specified on the type plate. For other network voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched over. In accordance with VDE regulations, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Proper operation of the coin system requires the device to be set up correctly and vertically. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor at any time, please switch off the machine for a short time (unplug it from the power supply) and then on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Unplug it before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch the parts that carry the voltage! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. ATTENTION, HIGH VOLTAGE! There are about 20,000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Only replace fuses with those with the same values! A blown fuse signals an overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced by a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Only replace components with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. QIX SERVICE MANUAL
gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. An attempt must be made to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game process is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are shown by red timing lines. If the red lines meet, additional SPARX will be released. When alarmed, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you are trying to draw your area, your marker falls into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path or return. If you hesitate and don't complete your surface, a fuse will be infected and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controllers work properly. For more information, see “Service Program.” The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
In general. The 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming display This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set using the “sub-test” button. When the desired language appears - green - press the “Test” button to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, it can be used to set a “maximum number of credits” that may exist before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button (appears green); the desired value for this line is programmed with the “Up” or “Down” button. By pressing the “Sub-Test” button several times, the factory or default setting can be achieved if the bottom line (RESET line) glows green, press the “Up” button. The values are reset, the pointer (called the lines that appear green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. “Test” always triggers the next program display. “Back” [Reserve high score value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until “High hit rate so far.” This value determines the required points/hit number that a player needs so that their own initials (names) and hit points can be entered on the screen. The “maximum number of credits” determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked if there is a coin lock. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, the loans cannot become zero if over 99 is added up. A free spins mode can be selected by setting “Maximum number of credits” to O. Further programming: “Number of games”: number of markers per credit
“Threshold”: Amount of the% number that must be reached in order to switch to the next round
“Time Limit”: Approval for additional Sparx
“Difficulty”: The difficulty level of the game process
“Tightening tone”: with “0" no sound when stationary
With “1" sound even when standing (animated sound) “table model”: with “0" standing device
with “1" table-top device
The loans per coin are set on the “slot programming” screen. High score program display (highest hit rate so far”). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous screen (setting “back”). By pressing the “Up” button, the initials QIX Standard are set. When you press the “Test” button, the next program display appears. The “overall evaluation.” By pressing the “Up” button, you can set it to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts over. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, when the device is switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of loans given for thrown in (converted coins). Loans granted: Number of loans given by the device.% Free spins: Loans granted (Loans paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes played if the game is extended or won.% Free time: Minutes/minutes won per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/Loans paid + credits granted
High score: Number at which a player had high enough hit rates to oust other players from the high score list. By pressing the “Up” button, the values are set to 0. Press the “Test” button to display the next program.
Throw slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the display can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a standard setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the “Up” and “Down” buttons, while the top digit glows green on the screen. The size values change as the number changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the “Test” button, the setting is accepted. If a setting is required that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button. After pressing it once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own settings are possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. As soon as the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the “Sub-Test” button. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the “Up” and “Down” buttons. The process is completed by pressing the “Test” button. The coin multiplier (“coin unit”) says how many coin units are given for each coin thrown in through an associated slot. Coin units - “Credit” shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. “Bonus” coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. “Min. coin” is a value that accumulates loans until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used as “0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE
If “Memory Failure - Service Required” appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default settings. This condition is likely to indicate battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the “Sub-Test” button or the “Self-Test” button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display; by pressing the “Test” button, the next program is displayed. If an endurance test of the video board is required, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test starts in auto test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. When the “Open Coin Door to Test” display appears, the J 19, 1 - 2 program plug must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be carried out. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off/I = on/X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the ROM checksum is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first. If this test is not successful, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional safety of memory shared by two processors by storing predefined series of numbers in RAM and then verifying whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 When the device stops with the above display, an error has been discovered. If the communication RAMs fail during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To localize the fault, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Failure in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all storage locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predefined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Test U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is displayed that the next check is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be available and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for Star No. 1 the 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable stitching defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to be so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size... In the end, it would have fit the length and waist... I could swim the rest. In addition, the lining material arrived as soon as the package was opened and spread all over the place. Just a shame.. It will be returned:/
Fast delivery and fine workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it easily from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is absolutely delighted. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly still be worn next year. We can recommend ordering.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not ideal. Unfortunately I've measured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But that is my mistake. I then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We picked it up when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it due to its size. Now that we are 12 months old, we have looked for him again and he can use it. He also hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it really calmed him down.
Quality is not adequate/Unfortunately it is declining
I have probably been dazzled by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (to store the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. As a result of the fact that I have just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that (as written in many reviews) it can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping it would be so, but there really can't be any talk of it. The padded walls are much thinner and don't offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the divisions inside, are of a different caliber, much more drab. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small items are also not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to pay for a decent backpack. It seems that quality does come at a price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew it was going back after 2 minutes. What I really liked was the color on the inside. You'll certainly find your stuff much faster here than with a grey interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is declining.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far, I had enjoyed the electrical series by E. L. Todd the most, but this book revised my opinion. I found the first two books very strong and also recommended and was really looking forward to the third part. This part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I found it unnecessarily protracted. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself and then is like a small child at every fight and gets away?! At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor liked him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't without him and that he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that this was the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more excitement to the story again.
Man destroys everything, doesn't appreciate anything and doesn't learn more! First of all: The movie isn't that bad now, as many write. Of course, the story is completely constructed, and designed over and over again according to the same scheme F. When you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: People destroy everything, they don't appreciate anything, and they don't learn more! And that is exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie (even though I know that it's just a movie and the animals come from the computer): Oh my god, the poor animals, it often makes you cry. That's why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that people simply don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment and, in the end, our planet and ourselves too. Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: Not true. 4 stars because the film is well done, but unfortunately always on the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still a well-done popcorn movie.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a movie à la 8 mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't even want to be. This film is above all “French” - it is also calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - when you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that he doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, of course orange, but that doesn't matter. A package every morning for 5 days: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My waist has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week. It can be noticed that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger package size a full 5? That is very very strange!
Terrible smell and low results! I dyed my blonde hair a chocolate brown with an intensive tint in October, and in February/March I used this hair color remover. I've used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, the result was not too bad, the result was about chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was just a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked the same as the first time I tried it. What was the worst of all, it still smelled weeks after use. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell simply did not disappear.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had already been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthily but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I'm sleeping better and I'm getting out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
Function not entirely perfect!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems “connecting” to the cell phone over time. This means that charging is no longer carried out even though you have pressed the “Power On/Off” button for 3 seconds. If you remove the cell phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the cell phone in the case, the cover is now so worn out that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times already. These aren't many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should function perfectly and that's why I'm very disappointed with the product for the cost of €30, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good review came about. In the end, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself a lot more of these cloths, they are really very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately I can no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side, the price for these towels is overstated more than 2 euros should not be available.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke down. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I really liked it in the shower), plays bass and bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I am critical of is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, that causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass as bass well, but the frequencies were displayed fairly naturally in volume. Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to subtract a star there. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint also went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both dresser were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and sent us the money back. PRAISE to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I didn't fault it because I needed this product urgently. The included adhesive barely holds, but it sticks neatly - like chewing gum which, however, does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. Some of the templates are not completely cut out. Ok for single use and as a gag for a party, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic clasps + nice look + sturdy when set up + shelf can be positioned as you want
- doors pop with magnets (you may be able to compensate with rubber nubs) - some unclean areas
- included dowels are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have them because there wasn't a trophy in the house, stuck with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with a little paper and balanced it out) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give it less stars because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. I also find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that sense, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full points soon.
Gets on my alarm
The alarm arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound awful, and extremely loud too. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time do not have to be entered again in the event of a power failure. But declined for the reasons mentioned above.
Great light, workmanship inadequate
I've replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. “Pay 6 - get 4” is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have settled this fairly and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see it as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for a two-star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color is more towards cold white. Perfect for hallways, workrooms, laundry rooms, etc. I would personally use warmer light for living spaces. Quite comparable with a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is of any help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I've received gestures, and I'd love to share my first look. Yes positive. I've thought about ordering this set for a long time or not. ** The material is sturdy and feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle so they can be hung up** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and they're gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping is simply great. Delivery within 24 hours Then the shock, unpack the tap and check all parts. We found out that the part had already been installed. We have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The screws/connections of the hoses were all damaged. However, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks/streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and returned. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. I just find it sad that customers are being fooled like this!!!
Product itself was great, unfortunately the outdoor sensor was broken after just 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still appears to be intact, and plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, as it always shows completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. This is a shame, as the device was attached to a protected area on the outside and that is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak collection basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with triggering a replacement delivery was excellent, as always. The mower arrived to me quickly and made a valuable impression. The motor is powerful and the result is a nice cut. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but okay. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a major drawback. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you put it down for just a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the content will fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the collection basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from there on. With a large lawn, always emptying the basket when it is only half full cannot be the solution. That's why I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if required. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only shown once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I only give it 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with very thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be even louder.
Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to level up the hotbed properly yet. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there and at the front right the screw almost falls out because it is not tightened at all even though the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the cart are straight and so is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it's impossible to print something out that way. About the construction: The construction was quite easy, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to re-lay them several times, which is very difficult. I've already contacted support, but I still haven't received an answer after waiting a week. Unfortunately, sending them back is also no longer possible. I was expecting a bit more.
robust and precise I am pleasantly surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper has given up after many years, so I needed a new one. This one looks very robust and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper. With, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, long-lasting smell
I bought the bracelet and haven't worn it for the time being because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been “aired out” constantly. Since it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger spheres are free to move, which in turn I find very nice. However, the necklace is very easy to make overall, so I've already opened the clasp twice. So far, I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will go well/last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to say the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I've rubbed it with a little leather care, which makes it even softer and cuddly. But if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately rubbish! I was disappointed even after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after a few gimmicks... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and re-installed it, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because the connection was gone again after just one hour, even though the stations were next to the base station. The display of the three stations was also very different! All in all, it's not that useful for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the internal shaft rusted off after 3.5 years. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections to the suction line and outlet would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production fault and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump was damaged during transport, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slits were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a bit better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
It could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. Everything went pretty well at first. However, the paint came off very quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I didn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw right away. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths thanks to the various parts, but once you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I installed it and the entire thing was therefore unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then all the keys you need for just once and then never again, but at that price, you can also buy yourself a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks robust and all of this is featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the goods after they have been used for the first time. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be placed directly in the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8 but 10 pieces were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/sachets. Not of high quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price/performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
Well, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use it again, he didn't do it anymore. battery? Swapped. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money straight into the garbage can.
Care is always good! It is easy to use, but you should use the brush very carefully so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear any improvement in the sound of my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. Definitely a completely adequate sound. I liked the fact that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The earpieces are super soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Price-performance ratio is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the flash deal. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I would only have liked the neckline not to be as deep and the sleeves could also use a little more fabric (if you don't have very thin upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect that such scrap would be sold these days. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. However, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are only detected unreliably. The discs must be inserted several times, then Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it doesn't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you should never press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the movie. This immediately results in an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually eyewash, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a stupid extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the look and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged in USB stick doesn't simply dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within tight limits :-).
Small but powerful! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With iOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works really well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I already had to send back were unable to do so. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Charging at the same time is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for: P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This should provide stability and also has a magnetic mount. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it's safe and secure and therefore has contact... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdy in one piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Plenty of performance
Top device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but performs well. I find the average temperature setting (TP setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised in live mode, the location feels accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode, however, when the dog is in the house, it likes to jump by a few meters, but this is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime. But what would be great would be a battery that lasts longer. It currently lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great here. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so our battery wouldn't have to last that long and we also find changing it every day impractical. You should deal with the dog, not with its collar :-). The app also worked perfectly.
Rubbish after a few weeks
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and appear to be comfortable too. However, the lifespan is declining more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in gym class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair also didn't last very long in normal use, but I thought it would be enough for the lesson. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Perfect fit - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews here yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would love to sleep in the car, I ordered them with good luck. The package included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is a bit of mold on one side. I've wiped it away and hope it doesn't show up again. When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly. It is easy to lie on and is great for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. Before that, we removed the seats at the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car cigarette lighter. However, the plug was faulty (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and when reassembled, the good part worked perfectly and inflated the mattress in no point. Overall, I'm very impressed with the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and that it lasts a long time. It also ensures that mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than €10... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the quick delivery. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, due to the lax processing, the calendar opened several doors directly on day 1. On the 21st door, there were no more doors at all and I had to more or less allow my son to remove the remaining parts accordingly, as they almost met him. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off when playing. (Mostly the windscreen. It is also very difficult to reinstall it.) As such, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone else. Manufacturers may rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I'm impressed by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. It flies very well inside and the 5 minute flight time is usually enough. I didn't expect hair to get stuck in it and the drone would break down very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, nice contact.
Game ok but can only be played by force on Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it wasn't a game CD but just a code with which you can download the game. That would still be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impudence. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Great design and look, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. Service worked well... and yet I'm sending it back. Big snags: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, just in the closet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery ran out by midday/early afternoon and then you can't even tell the time anymore. Therefore not useful for me. It's a shame.
Elegant case with limitations
You should definitely buy a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. Recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards in all 3 pockets, it gets too many, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case looks robust and seems to be well made. She looks classy. Unlike many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only the ports have openings. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even the QI leather charging station from TORRO doesn't work. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
High-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with real tempered glass to protect the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily pulled up. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly to the phone. Overall a good buy.

The treatment of extensive or complex hand injuries places particular demands on the functional and aesthetic results.
Primary soft tissue coverage is of particular importance in this type of injury, as this significantly improves the initial situations for restoring function.
The diagnosis of a floating thrombus in the open oval foramen (so-called transit thrombus) without arterial embolism is rare.
In the case described here, the diagnosis was made through routine transthoracic echocardiography.
Persistent cellular microchimerism could play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism results from the transport of fetal cells through the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSC patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism could trigger SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like reaction.
Autologous blood collection before elective surgical procedures helps to reduce the perioperative risk, but can itself trigger side effects.
Are there particular patient characteristics that influence the frequency and severity of adverse events?
Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease only begins in adulthood, which is then referred to as Still's disease beginning in adulthood (“adult onset Still's disease”).
The diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthema, joint problems, fever attacks and leukocytosis as well as liver function disorders, sore throat with no detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and lack of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a long time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The exanthema of M. Still is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply defined maculae, which are very fleeting.
Slight friction can trigger erythematous Köbner phenomena during a rash, which, as we describe here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthema.

The assessment of melanocytic tumours represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria are required for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or a melanocytic nevus that is suitable for differential diagnosis.
In the case of malignant melanoma, the prognostically relevant tumor parameters that are important for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and uniformly in the histopathological report.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children represent a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective treatment and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
The causes are infections with a wide range of pathogens. In addition to the usual bacterial pathogens, the focus is on pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses.
However, in 25-30% of cases, respiratory symptoms are due to non-infectious causes.
Anamnesis, lung x-rays and blood tests are often of little help in making a diagnosis.
However, the analysis of respiratory material often leads to the diagnosis:
nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage provides diagnostic clarification in 60-80%; the remaining cases must be diagnosed by a usually open lung biopsy, if the clinic is appropriate.
Mostly women of younger to middle age are affected.
In German-speaking countries, this clinical picture has not yet been mentioned in the literature.
We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical picture of IMDE (type I).
The particular interest of this case report is the fact that there is no dependence on light, which has also been shown by the fact that no worsening has occurred with PUVA therapy.
IMDE is probably a particular type of elastolytic disease in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Using pre- and post-operative computer tomograms (CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to verify the efficiency of direct repositioning of stenosing trailing edge fragments carried out under intraoperative ultrasound control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction in ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is wider than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates greater narrowing.
In fractures without neurological failure symptoms, fragment reposition promises to prevent long-term damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there is evidence of ultrasound analgesia in patients with non-radicular back pain when administered serially, depending on the prescribed power density (LD).
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult to repo mandible fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly displaced fractures in the distal part of the mandible can also be successfully treated using monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a ranking value for classifying trauma, appears to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between the two treatment concepts.
However, with just 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for describing mandibular trauma that all studies conducted so far, with their low case numbers, can only provide a rough differential indication.
As long as there is no prospective multicenter study that could help to decide which osteosynthesis method to use, the functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications should be preferred in the fluid range between “simple” and “difficult” fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representations of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about genetic aberrations, software was developed that enables the objective recording of the location and type of changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that supplements the morphological description.
Surgical procedures can be precisely planned and simulated using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures created from a patient's tomography data.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance with the intraoperative implementation of what was previously planned as well as with spatial orientation in the surgical site.
Following the successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction of laboratory analyses are now increasingly leading to a renewed re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is carried out near the patient outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small quantities of samples.
While these benefits are often emphasized, they are not accompanied by a clearly identifiable clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analytical devices by untrained station personnel, lack or lack of calibration and/or quality control, costs due to the availability of multiple devices and more expensive reagents, inadequate documentation and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also obvious.
According to the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory doctors in order to ensure the usefulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation (24-hour central laboratory, etc.), the range of parameters of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analytes required for this should be:
hemoglobin or hematocrit, activated whole blood clotting time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia, and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures through MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects are a prerequisite.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents, and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still at the very beginning of development.
MR tomography may be of considerable importance in the area of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
In patients with chronic renal failure, there are characteristic skeletal changes.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the changes in bone mass in the spine during long-term hemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Spines of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years were completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, combined two and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly.
Vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular linkage (tBPF) were evaluated quantitatively.
The spine deformity index (SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve, which decreases from the cervical spine to the lumbar spine, is 5% lower for the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with prolonged hemodialysis have higher BV/TV levels regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological spongiasal networking and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP results in a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be inferred on the 2-D incision planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and therefore functional spongiosal architecture in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described a form of inguinal hernia for the first time, which, due to the course of the disease and the dissection findings obtained by Littré himself, did not correspond to what was previously known.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the rupture of the intestinal wall in a scientific paper on “fractures” and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the “Richter-Littré hernia” in German-speaking countries.
On the basis of a case report, the historical analysis of this form of hernia is carried out.
Asperger syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described in 1944 by Hans Asperger, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 1980s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was only included in the ICD-10 as a diagnosis in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the malfunction is unknown.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger syndrome, who also had epilepsy and internal disorders, is presented.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger syndrome, such as epilepsies, are discussed in addition to diagnostic criteria and therapeutic procedures.
Yersinia infections usually manifest as febrile gastro-enteritis or pseudoappendicitis in childhood.
A child is reported in whom the Yersinia infection manifested as tumor-shaped lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was made through the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after treatment with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings return to normal.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
The questions were addressed as to what conclusions the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation allow us to draw and what consequences arise from these findings.
The investigation shows that a high percentage of pulse oximetry appears suitable for quality control of resuscitation measures carried out.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the last 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This applies even if an autopsy was unable to clarify the cause of death.
At this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented, which showed the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In the early postoperative period after vaginal hysterectomy, a 58-year-old female patient developed signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with expulsive coagulopathy and fever, followed by septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected in this autologous blood reserve, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned goods was not identifiable.
It is shown that autologous hemotherapy also has a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and that the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal infections in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a serious infection caused by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association that developed fungal lesions in the renal pelvis following candidasepsis, which led to hydronephrosis with incipient post-renal failure.
Antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin and direct irrigation with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy normalized excretory function.
As the incidence of systemic candida infections increases, particularly in neonatology, the possibility of a bezoar formation should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to be able to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for treating acutely exacerbed atopic dermatitis.
It has now been shown that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy or respond only insufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the following parameters:
skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, it was found that non-responders have a significantly higher atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and of specific IgE compared to responders.
In addition, non-responders were found to have a relatively high bacterial colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestines with Candida albicans.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective for all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopy syndrome and on the other hand by complicating superinfections.
The latter finding indicates that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment could be beneficial for these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
Using two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with characteristics of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is shown.
Subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates are clinically present, which can lead to ulcerations and scarring infiltration.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
A positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components on the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels is also considered a further diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance, as lupus erythematosus profundus may precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis over 45 years.
The patient died under the clinical signs of a low-output cardiac syndrome as a result of vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autoptically and toxicological analyses.
The pathogenesis and morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been intensive research interest in the mechanisms of the development of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new treatment methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, old age, with limited cardiac pumping function, after previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires risk stratification, which divides the surgical risk into “low,” “medium,” and “high.”
A distinction can be made between pre-, intra- and post-operative patient, structural and treatment-related factors.
On the basis of this forecast, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra- and post-operative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary organized management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumours, especially spinalioma and basal cell carcinoma.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, a spinalioma and a lymph node metastasis of malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complementation analysis, which resulted in an assignment to complement group D.
Patients with malignancies on the breast, thoracic wall and/or abdominal wall that have not been treated for many years and have since been exulcerated present plastic surgeons with the need for large defect coverages after tumour resection.
By using silver-containing activated carbon fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer pads (Allevyn), an infection could be avoided after flank replacement by omentum plasty as part of resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable trunk wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The health care reform in Germany in 2000 does little to change the structural deficiencies of the German healthcare system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and registered contract doctors for outpatient care are not affected.
Hospital budgeting remains.
In future, mandatory catalogues will be prescribed for outpatient operations that may not be performed in an inpatient setting.
The quality assurance obligation is clarified and strengthened.
A new DRG-based pricing system is being introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure represents a complex immunological process, which is influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis includes the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibit the activation of NF-B and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control cells' immune reactivity, both locally and system-wide.
If you characterize this immune reactivity, you may ultimately also better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and of potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumours are usually unspecific.
Radiographically, only bleaching of the bone can often be seen, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities.
Root tip resorption may be another important finding.
After a brief historical overview, the current state of knowledge will be briefly presented for each individual type, based on the currently valid WHO classification.
This is then used to develop the treatment concept that is valid today, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumours.
Generalized happiness disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness that is often diagnosed late and is characterized by a uniformity of emotional experience in the face of circumstances that are normally the cause of depressive mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person concerned and prevent adverse long-term individual and social consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate treatment.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the last 20 years.
Only a therapeutic regimen that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of the inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequences and preserve the patient's life.
This article presents the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with particular attention to molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly useful when differentiating bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
This technique therefore allows a precise evaluation of the complicated details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique makes it possible to accurately characterize pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of currently available studies on oral IC therapy were conducted neither randomized, double-blind nor placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
As a result, there is still no uniform standard for oral treatment of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turk who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratoses or flat warts.
Ultrastructurally, keratinocytes show premature and faulty keratinization.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be differentiated from severe, congenital keratinization disorders, which show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
Antifibrinolytic substances are often used today in procedures involving extracorporeal circulation (ECZ) in cardiac anesthesia to reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss.
However, there are also concerns about their potential as a trigger for thrombotic complications.
In the present case, the effectiveness of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during heart surgery under ECZ should therefore be compared.
The imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
The involvement of the manubriosterial joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional radiography and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients were vitrectomized at the Leipzig University Eye Hospital due to endophthalmitis.
All patients received intravitréal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the “endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.”
This retrospective work should examine the functional results of surgical treatment.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of a Pseudologia phantastica in his childhood.
The underlying factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this work.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis and the therapeutic effect as a function of the HLA B27 characteristic will be tested.
The present study presents the medical history of a patient with severe OCD symptoms that have existed since the age of 14.
It is not a separate obsessive-compulsive disorder, but schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
The treatment of schizophrenic symptoms with clozapine, which exacerbates at the age of 31, does not include psychotic symptoms or any noteworthy symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder in the one-year catamnesis.
While the literature increasingly points to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychosis, the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved by clozapine in schizophrenia is described here - as far as the author is aware.
The importance of differential diagnosis of compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of individual cases.
An isomorphic irritation effect (Köbner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli.
It is reported that such a Köbner phenomenon is triggered in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by a UV-B light test with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new foci of psoriasis developed in the viral efflorescences following a varicella infection.
Since the person concerned was planning a stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was made to rule out an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to the question of genetic risk factors to develop one, and to the question of whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a vaccination reaction;
Initial experiences and results are reported with 13 one-stage reconstructions of large complex head and neck defects using 8 microvascular-anastomosed forearm transplants and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major insular lobes.
There were no complete rag losses in any case.
Better functional and aesthetic results were achieved with the free forearm transplant, but the surgical times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
The main disadvantages of the PECTORALIS major flap are its poor modelling ability and a limited radius of rotation.
It was used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular transplant would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a wide range of exogenous stimuli, which can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While until now, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has primarily been regarded as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there has recently been evidence that exogenous factors can put endothelial cells in a state ready for inflammation even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of tissue mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, in particular after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, are an indication for local administration of rtPA.
We report on our findings.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle-cell tumour of the lymph node, described for the first time 5 years ago and not yet documented in German-language literature, is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumour occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of myofibroblastic cells arranged in sections like palisades (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) on the periphery, their diagnostic criteria include accentuated hemorrhage zones and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures (“amianthoid fibers”), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
As a result of the increased strength of 2 parallel inner splints, obstruction and kinking could be reduced and the congestion of the proximal hollow system could be reduced.
In addition to urine flow within the splints, this technique also enables increased flow between the splints, which is regarded as a crucial mechanism for urine passage when ureteral splints are lying down.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression, in which the incorporation of a singular inner splint does not achieve sufficient regression of ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous incorporation of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication treatment alternative, which requires some patients to insert a percutaneous nephrostostoid can save catheters or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis), intradiscal administration of chymopapain is the method with the longest period of clinical use and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
If the indication and the few contraindications - in particular allergic diathesis - are carefully considered, chemonucleolysis provides an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
In a prospective study, the value of diuresesonography compared to the diuresis ephrogram (“gold standard”) in children with urinary transport disorders should be investigated.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.
The method has been further developed and modified over the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three processes have the same goal:
radical tumour removal while sparing the unaffected tissue in the surrounding area.
However, they have significant differences with regard to the technique of tumour excision, the strengthening of histological sections and histological preparation evaluation.
A methodological inventory is carried out and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is approximately 30 years.
The “Marjolin Ulcer” is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In one case of a 65-year-old patient with a lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on combined radiotherapy and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after a correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograde stalked radial flap.
Opioids close to the spinal cord produce good analgesia for a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with epidural administration of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in post-operative pain management, including patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA), are presented.
The intrathecal mode of administration is considered to have various advantages over the epidural mode.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids is dependent on different forms of administration.
There is no clinical advantage of a thoracic injection over a lumbar injection with regard to the quality of analgesia, the serious side effects, the amount of opioid administered or the postoperative lung function.
There is probably evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with high preoperative risk and is cost-effective at the same time.
Through the cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests are recorded centrally at the participating centers in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Peru balm and thiomersal showed reactions most frequently;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also created for defined patient groups (by sex, age, eczema localization, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and specific questions.
In percentage terms, there were significantly fewer positive reactions for nickel, fragrance mix and Peru balm among men than among women.
Younger patients responded more frequently to thiomersal and older patients to external medical treatment.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg eczema, while more occupational allergens were found in hand eczematics.
In nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers, there were higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve quality in the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all people infected (come into contact) with M. leprae, the disease does not come into overt onset.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T-cell-mediated immune response.
In this review article, current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy are considered.
Recently, a variety of studies have been presented to quantitatively investigate the Tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (KW) using laser tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison with the Tyndall intensity in kW in uveitids of different localizations, it should be investigated, by way of example, to what extent the Tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disorder.
The present experimental study investigates the effect of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on the neurological deficit following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances results in the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for neurite regeneration.
Positive animal test results do not stand up to clinical testing, as inferior regeneration services can occur in animal experiments despite a hindered regeneration path.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term consequences is the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, and one third developed cervical dysplasia.
A quarter experienced chronic symptoms and long-term consequences of ascending genital infections over the course of the course.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer (up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but it usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed more frequently.
Premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth are particularly noteworthy complications of pregnancy.
No progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy was observed.
Risks for peripartum infection transmission to fetuses include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenaemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as preterm delivery, premature labor, amniotic infection, duration of rupture and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of an increased maternofetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low-contamination caesarean delivery (4-6%) and most successfully by primary sectio and concurrent prepartum, intrapartum and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2%).
Dendritic cells play a central role in initializing the immune response, as they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
First clinical studies on patients with treatment-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized with tumor antigen in vitro can be used successfully in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumour tissue and their function are known for laryngeal cancer, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis, was examined immunohistologically in the present study.
The results show that, in contrast to T lymphocytes, dendritic cells are primarily detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
When compared with clinical parameters, it is shown that patients whose number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest post-operative survival time (1 year).
This indicates that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal cancer is a favorable prognostic factor for the disease.
Increased homocysteine is considered a major factor in the increased incidence of arteriosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure.
In the present study, the metabolites of its two metabolic pathways, transulfuration (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate), were determined in patients with renal insufficiency in addition to homocysteine.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on a history of cat scratches and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the incidence and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in 1984-94 at a university clinic or dermatological practice was carried out on the basis of patient records and, in some cases, also through follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was 0.05% thereafter.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean duration of illness 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of the patients had atopy and 23.2% had other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and wame-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were only positive in individual cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with usually only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During antibiotic treatment (penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracyclines 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), 13 patients achieved complete remission and 8 achieved improvement.
20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) experienced spontaneous remission over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment results with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented primarily with lumbar pain is reported.
Both in laboratory chemistry, radiology and histopathology, the findings primarily indicated the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Dorsoventral stabilization was performed due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excisions, the histological picture of an unspecific inflammation was found.
It was only during the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal that a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma was histologically detected.
There was chemotherapy according to the CHOP scheme and radiotherapy treatment.
Spinal lymphoma should be considered a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, particularly in progressive cases.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with midface and/or frontobase fractures in over 90% of cases.
In up to 70% of cases, accompanying skull base fractures run through the roof of the ethmoid cells or the lamina cribrosa.
There are various concepts for treating isolated NEO fractures as well as combined NEO and skull base fractures for midface fractures.
In the period from 1990 to 1997, 50 patients were treated with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital.
The remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without involvement of the base of the skull were repositioned and treated via a subcranial access route.
47 patients could be followed up to 4 years and their data could be evaluated.
The Lucerne therapeutic concept for the extra and transcranial treatment of ethmoid fractures involving the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
However, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intra- and post-operatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V.A. phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be treated surgically.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in the end-tidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in PaCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures including chest compressions and intravenous administration of epinephrine and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was ended with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In V. a. fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis was performed with 100 mg rt-PA with continued chest compressions.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics were achieved with continuous, high-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
As a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy, a massive transfusion was required.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of “pulmonary embolism” was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation involving continuous resuscitation, no further diagnostic procedures were used.
When anesthetized with the new inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total administered dose is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting peak serum levels of inorganic fluoride is determined in particular by the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficient.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated the question of whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, no increased renal risk potential for fluoride exposure to sevoflurane was detected neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use, nor with prolonged duration of anesthesia, nor when used in renal failure patients.
The only recently proven low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol/l, which has been used so far in the literature, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those found following anaesthesia with sevoflurane, can therefore be classified as clinically safe.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence of direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease.
The best results are obtained by basal parallel lamination of the heart ventricles to be carried out after fixation and the transversal lamination of the coronary arteries that may have been additionally decalcified, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can precede.
With this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference and transmural expansion of infarcts, their age and sequelae can be better recorded and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than with the conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood stream.
On the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed without damage, as can the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in cases of acute cardiac death and territorial ischemia that only survived for a short time.
By systematically collecting transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be recorded in correlation with coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
However, recent prospective randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection provides no additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, oesophagogastric junction and stomach are not yet conclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumours, several phase III studies did not show any convincing prognosis gains due to preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined radio/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach can only be expected if the patient responds to pretreatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio/chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Neoadjuvant treatment concepts should therefore only be carried out in the context of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual for childhood, is usually only associated with certain metabolic diseases.
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or “hysterical” symptoms are increasingly understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Memories of trauma that cannot be assimilated have a retraumatizing effect and must be averted, for example through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harm or social “action.”
On this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner space and contact with inner helpers are created in the imagination in a resource-oriented manner.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stably confronting, but as little retraumatizing as possible introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and leaving yourself behind.
The final phase is once again about the resource-oriented focus on creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years with regard to diagnoses and the proportion of people with multiple disabilities.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women (“pseudotumor cerebri”), a venous outflow obstruction is a possible cause.
It was investigated to what extent visual acuity remains stable over the long term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy, and which causes and risk factors for worsening visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easy to inactivate with the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the point of entry.
After inoculation, HIV multiplication can start after 24 hours and the HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can be used to detect the impending HIV infection within four to twelve weeks; during therapy, the antibody response is attenuated;
With nuleic acid tests, detection is possible from around the eleventh day.
In almost 100 years of development, countless endogenous, exogenous and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently preferred autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadrupled tendon graft of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some restrictions, the use of corpse transplants is also justified.
The individual transplants have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, the clear superiority of one of the above grafts could not be verified.
When selecting a transplant, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account.
The treatment of complex ligament injuries and revision cases requires careful, preoperative planning with, if necessary, modified transplant selection.
The rare course of myoepithelial carcinoma development in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
In the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumour developed twice in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
Histological processing showed myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands; parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnosis, treatment and histological characteristics are discussed taking into account the literature.
Coronary calcification is indicative of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very precisely with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance differs depending on whether lime screening is performed for primary prevention in patients with known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically important aspect of coronary heart disease.
In this work, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects with regard to ergometry are presented and tips for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice are given.
We report on 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred as part of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
On the other hand, we did not observe any case of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
In patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, other diseases should therefore be excluded from the category of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
Securing the airways after upper airway surgery can be problematic for certain patients.
Safe reintubation should therefore be ensured when necessary.
Two patients are reported who had significant intubation difficulties due to recurrent papillary thyroid cancer or inoperable hypopharyngeal cancer and therefore high risk factors for intubation and possibly reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiberoptically placed endotracheal guidewire was used as a post- or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of laryngeal tumors.
A very precise knowledge of the submucous tumor spread pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for staging and therapy is essential for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive tests for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, the paraglottic space, the subglottis and the cartilage.
However, the specificity with both methods is less high than initially expected, which results in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two cross-sectional imaging methods is important from a clinical perspective, as it makes it possible to rule out neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucous tumours, both CT and MRI provide valuable information about a possible etiology, the extent of submucosal growth and the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators (ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with end-stage renal failure have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only small numbers of cases of myocardial revascularization using PTCA in patients requiring chronic dialysis, which suggest a high peri-interventional complication rate and a high rate of restenosis.
We examined the rate of restenosis in 23 patients with end-stage renal failure (17 men, 6 women, middle age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primarily successful PTCA, record angiography was performed on all patients within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic monitoring, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginous symptoms.
In laboratory chemistry, patients had hypertriglyceridaemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old female patient is described, who experienced complete pelvic instability within one year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings.
A minor pelvic trauma was retrospectively assumed as the triggering event.
Because of the X-ray morphology of multiple pseudoarthroses, the primary focus of differential diagnosis was initially on the suspicion of a malignant event.
Hip pain in childhood is caused by a wide range of different symptoms.
The main focus is on non-traumatic causes in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid superfluous examinations on the one hand and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other.
Exemplary examples demonstrate some common but also rarer symptoms.
The iatrogenic abortion of the major trochanter in prosthetic treatment of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of frequently elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called “back access” could be predisposing factors.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for isolated traumatic trochanteric ablation, which is used here for comparison, even in the case of significant fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care remains controversial.
The present work presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of various methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
On the basis of ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patients' further use behavior, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
This shows that the relationship between treatment results and satisfaction is not particularly great.
In terms of further use behavior, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The connection between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is sometimes clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are very large in relative terms, but in absolute terms, these effects are rather small.
This is primarily due to the fact that only very few patients express dissatisfaction following their treatment.
Changes in men's aging process are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels fall on average with age, correlations between symptoms in middle and older age and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men and various influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
Following nuclear medical evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism, a 68-year-old patient with dyspnoea for five days was ultrasonography prior to planned lysis therapy.
A right atrial floating thrombus was found.
If there was an acute vital risk, an ultra-high-dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely disappeared and the thrombosis of the leg had largely disappeared.
The patients treated were mostly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in road accidents.
A single fracture was found in 50% of the patients; the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or multiple traumas.
The average length of hospitalization was 17 days and the average use of crutches was 21 weeks, which indicates a relatively rapid healing process.
For the majority (85%), treatment was without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in 9 cases (1.8%) in patients with an open fracture and in only 2 cases (0.4%) in patients with closed fractures, which is within normal standards.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of femoral diaphysis fractures with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics for head and neck cancer is still controversial.
In the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were used to examine which factors influence the frequency and localization of remote metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumour diagnosis.
The distant metastasis rate was positively correlated with the initial tumour stage (p<0.00001) and with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a secondary tumour outside the ENT range (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'primary tumor location' and 'histopathological tumour grading', on the other hand, had no independent predictive value, but reflected essentially different frequencies of tumour stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases for tumours of the categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to a thoracic X-ray examination.
Further diagnosis, consisting of abdominal ultrasonography, skeletal scintigraphy and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumours, recurrence and secondary tumours outside the ENT area.
However, you should always ask yourself the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article provides a brief overview of the history of spine surgery from the end of the 19th century to our time.
Ernst Simmel was one of a small group of early psychoanalysts who endeavoured with great enthusiasm and in “productive orthodoxy” to apply psychoanalytic principles in medicine to the clinical use of psychoanalytic principles.
As a result, he is the founder of the first psychoanalytical polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and of the first psychoanalytical hospital (“Sanatorium Schloss Tegel”) in 1927 in Germany.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions between professional societies.
He is a credible figure of professional policy identification across generations, particularly for the new specialist in “psychotherapeutic medicine.”
However, Simmel's emphasis should not mean that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany due to their Jewish ancestry, are no longer duly considered.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be affected by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is of central importance here.
With the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was the meta-analytical review of all available randomized, controlled trials in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetic agents to prevent nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur as part of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and visual-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term through systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints result in unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated intervertebral disc occurs on the side of compression in more than 80% of cases, a causal link can be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the case of a herniated intervertebral disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for malignant changes in the area of the pancreatic head, is very extensive and is fraught with a high perioperative morbidity and mortality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign pancreatic head tumours.
The patients were able to perform this operation without blood and with almost no complications.
With a median follow-up period of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free; one patient who underwent surgery due to a gastrinoma had elevated gastrin levels late after surgery.
Compared to preoperative functional testing, it was shown that endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly affected by surgery.
If the indication is strict, benign tumours in the area of the pancreatic head can therefore be treated adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications and without permanent restriction of exo- and endocrine functions by means of a duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method for the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardial heart rhythm disorders.
Approximately one in six patients dies of sudden cardiac death following pacemaker implantation, which is largely attributable to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrostimulation of the heart can pose the risk of triggering and/or aggravation of life-threatening ventricular heart rhythm disorders.
Particularly in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, “short-long” sequences and perceptual defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transitory myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and appropriate awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but, above all, safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. determining the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative objectives, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are administered to alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computer tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), ultrasonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for the staging of bronchial cancer.
For specific questions, e.g. after chest wall infiltration, and for patients with a contrast agent allergy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to CT.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F] 2-flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) to assess lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111 octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, and thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical significance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also becoming increasingly common for staging lunges tumors used.
Methods that are currently still being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumour rezoptor, could play an important role in the staging of bronchial cancer in the future.
Tumour surgery in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and small pelvis may result in damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, particular importance is attached to the prevention of such side effects in tumour therapy.
An impairment of erection or ejaculation disorders may occur after surgical, radiotherapeutic or medicinal therapy for various tumours.
Thanks to an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, a high percentage of these disorders are now preventable.
If damage to the corresponding nerve pathways cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical procedure required to treat the tumour disease curatively, sexual dysfunction is a significant impairment of the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated in almost all cases through a range of treatment modalities.
The subclavian artery is increasingly being used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
So far, little is known about the perfusion characteristics of neck vessels at different cannulation sites.
It is reported about a truck driver who developed an atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after crushing trauma to both legs with medicinal thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
In addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with positive antibody detection against heparin:
During our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was surgically split, also on the left lower leg.
After excluding possible other causes of these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after rinsing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed a full picture of an anaphylactic reaction, which could be immediately interrupted by administration of cortisone.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, otherwise known as characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of the thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the various forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Types I and II correspond to previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without drop in platelets and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s “Histological Typing of Salivary Gland Tumors” in 1991.
The first description dates back to Ellis & Wiskovitch (1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
The parotid gland is the site of this tumour in 90% of cases.
Enormous manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumour extirpation with a sufficient safety distance and histologically controlled tumour clearance of all resection edges.
According to current knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma has a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenous metastasis rate of 10% that occurs up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal model of kidney xenotransplantation was developed, in which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs to wistar rats as recipient animals, using end-to-end vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or V. cava and ureteral drainage by splinting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on kidney xenotransplants.
A total of 24 xenotransplants were performed and randomly treated with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group) or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3 ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in extending transplant survival time (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was observed in the sCR1 group, which is attributable to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, the control group showed a mass of platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates.
The kidney transplants treated with sCR1, on the other hand, showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombosis and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the treatment group.
So far, 52 laparoscopic procedures on the gallbladder, stomach, large intestine and inguinal hernia have been performed in our house using the robotic arm controlled by the surgeon's voice for optical guidance.
In this case, the field of view is determined directly by commands from the surgeon.
During all procedures, the control of the robotic arm was precise, and the voice recognition was accurate and without any technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by one surgeon alone as “solo surgery.”
In a further 20 procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
The clarification of vascular complications caused by DSA in kidney and pancreas transplants requires invasive intervention in vessels that are usually diabetically damaged, and the use of iodine-containing contrast media may show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated using a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in collaboration between trauma surgery and the medical clinic of Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic approach using imaging and microbiological methods allows targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the treatment outcome and discussion of the literature, the presented approach is successful, both in terms of local remediation of the infection and functional outcome.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization, which favor an interruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion therefore appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
The observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus as a result of a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported casuistically.
Diabetes mellitus type I is an autoimmune disease and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of coeliac disease and type I diabetes in the medical records of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the children's clinic at TU Dresden.
There is a report of a granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of resorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon transplant in anterior cruciate ligament replacement plasty, which resulted in a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was a sterile infection with evidence of giant foreign body cells.
Primary kidney plasmacytomas are a major rarity.
To date, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented in whom an operated kidney tumour histologically proved to be a plasmacytoma.
On the basis of this case, the treatment of this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma involving kidneys, nephrectomy is only indicated for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary kidney involvement due to plasmacytoma is unclear.
As part of a multi-center, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults selected a treatment indication or treatment method corresponding to the type of fracture.
The success of primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
To date, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known, which follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired stripy, atrophic, and pigmented skin condition, which he identified as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without a preliminary inflammatory stage and without subsequent sclerosing or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We suggest the name “Atrophodermia linearis Moulin” for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and a special exercise program to improve the muscular situation, which can also be carried out safely as home training.
In group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge of anatomy, the development of osteoarthritis and knee-friendly and relieving behavior is imparted.
The efficiency of the “knee school” as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was proven in a prospective randomized study.
The correct alignment and size of the implants is of paramount importance for successful and permanent knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are shown.
As part of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP proved to be suitable for separating safely ill patients from secure controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, out-of-hospital primary care for 274 acutely injured (58%) or ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 with regard to the time required for assignments, compliance with the period of assistance, age and gender distribution, degrees of severity, causes of trauma and injury patterns, type of acute pediatric illness, emergency pre-hospital diagnosis and therapy, and examined the means of transport and the destination clinic on the basis of emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the Orthopaedic University Hospital Mainz has been investigating which symptoms low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be used effectively for.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with increasing age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for interpreting patient examinations for diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in test subjects as part of the present study.
Treatment control is currently not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and condition following cardioversion due to atrial fibrillation.
For this reason, patients without an actual tendency to relapse are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic treatment regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
An exact validation of the method is a mandatory requirement for P-wave analysis under sine rhythm.
P-wave triggering must take place, the P-wave filtering must be carried out bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is urgently desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in the duration of P waves from patients without this rhythm disorder.
As a class III antiarrhythmic agent, sotalol does not influence the P wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P wave is significantly different.
In summary, the signal averaging of the P wave, after optimization of the method, makes it possible to identify patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
Knowledge of the genesis of pain is a prerequisite for effective pain management.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afferents are conducted via an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by nervous system injuries.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to a chronification of such pain.
The treatment of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics are of particular importance for chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain management standards must be observed.
Blockades with local anesthetics as a monotherapy of chronic pain are now obsolete.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages are of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The significance of pelvic lymphatic drainage tract irradiation in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, additional irradiation of the paraaortic lymphatic drainage pathways does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival compared to irradiation of pelvic lymph nodes alone and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies using outdated radiation technology.
Radiation therapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymphoid node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard treatment but an individual decision and should be carried out as part of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
However, due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
The pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented below and, in particular, the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be treated definitively by thin-caliber drainage.
On the other hand, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated in the case of complicated pneumothorax.
Tension pneumothorax, which is often acute and life-threatening, with its typical clinic, e.g. in ventilators, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
A haematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with a bulau drainage due to the risk of severe blood loss and, if necessary, surgically treated.
Spontaneous haematothorax also requires drainage and internal examination.
The doctor in an internal intensive care unit must be able to diagnose and treat pneumo- and haematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether the routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory tests, microbiology and radiology.
The mortality rate, the overall severity of injury, the probability of bleeding complications and the proportion of accompanying pelvic injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. pelvic injuries with accompanying peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip), represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions are at the forefront of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabular fractures represent a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome worsens.
The primary accident-related cartilage damage appears to have a significant impact on the long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
Isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete aortic lumen filling caused symptoms typical of aortic isthmus stenosis in a 56-year-old female patient.
What is remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta and the extent of the calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested differentially diagnoses of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection, or expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalyzing outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since cholesterol and phospholipids are absorbed via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of these types of receptors were investigated in RPE.
With reference to the changes in educational and social structures, medical habilitation has recently also been called into question as proof of academic qualification.
In the discourse on the use and development of reproductive techniques, the aspects of experience of those affected recede into the background.
Many people only ask for help outside of medical treatment at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastases in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic treatment methods depends on histology, the evidence of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
Hormone therapy is the first choice for receptor-positive breast cancer and prostate cancer.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or when liver metastases are detected.
In the case of small cell lung cancer, chemotherapy should always be performed.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, the indication for systemic therapy is rather cautious and is limited in particular to younger patients and patients in a sufficiently good general condition.
There are difficulties in imaging the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for the determination of bone breakdown products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and treatment of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve expansion pain should be investigated.
Subjectively, the risk of contracting HIV at work is often regarded as high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical sector.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccinations; for example, there is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination for hospital workers.
In the case of injuries involving HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-exposure.
There is no medicinal post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early treatment with interferon when HCV RNA is detected appears to have a high success rate.
A 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis using a videothoracoscopic lung biopsy.
Pulmonary changes had resulted in recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strongly positive reactions both in the muscularly differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal brain of up to 5 cm in diameter.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidneys, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion on questions of euthanasia, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to prefer medical assistance to suicide over active homicide - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on assisted suicide by a psychiatrist in 1994 gives reason to examine this issue from a psychiatric perspective.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (BNOS and eCNOS) in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate products were investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically.
By means of the NADPH diaphorase (d) reaction as well as immunohistochemically, a differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, the stroma and the vessels could be detected.
In the case of preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there appears to be a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out due to the small number of preparations.
In the endothelium region, differentiated expression of NOS, depending on the vessel section, was also detected by means of the NADPH-D reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-D reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests that nitric oxide is highly important in smooth muscle regulation, regional blood flow and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Because of heterogeneous patient groups and diverse causes of ileus, it is difficult to standardize the surgical indication and the choice of surgical procedure for small intestine ileus.
A uniform procedure for intraoperative handling of the intestine (stripping, inserting an intestinal splint) and abdominal wall closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques for small bowel licature are still being used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble surgery largely being replaced by the Child-Phillips plicature and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no reliable indications or contraindications for plicatures, long probes and other surgical measures.
In view of the frequency and socio-economic significance of the small intestine ileus, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine appears to be more than justified.
Only reliable evaluation of the results achieved through reproductive medicine and their public discussion can make it possible to increase social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, and at the same time prevent misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis is a valuable tool for providing reliable advice to affected couples.
Gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength of depressed people have often been described in clinical literature, but have hardly been investigated empirically so far.
We recorded various gait and force parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework, which is based primarily on classic clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressed people were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which record stride length, average walking pace, maximum walking pace and 3-minute walking distance, and compared with 20 healthy test subjects.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were demonstrated, in particular, in knee and elbow extensions and also in all examined gait parameters.
The methods used for psychiatric issues in the present pilot study for the first time are suitable for the reliable and less stressful investigation of relationships between depression and motor function and can therefore be used in broad-based studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can result in an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We report results after cataract surgery for subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenic training (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
Apart from selective deviations, the VIP plasma concentrations did not show any significant differences from the standard values (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Up to 3.2 and 4 years of age, both showed progressive neurological decline, severe mental retardation, signs of multiple dysostosis and storage phenomena in lymphocytes.
The -L-fukosidase activity in leucocytes and fibroblasts was significantly reduced (< 3% of normal value).
To date, the mutation G401X has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6 year old girl who came to hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased CSF protein were detected in CSF.
The thrombus had to be removed cardiosurgically.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
This routinely performed test gave highly positive results for ketones in the autopsy of three people who died clearly as a result of frostbite or hypothermia, without the glucose in the urine being increased at the same time.
Using headspace gas chromatography, excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L were detected in all three urine samples.
A highly positive Keto Diabur Test 5000 with normal glucose levels in urine can therefore serve as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study involving 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the underlying source of bleeding and can thus provide information for the therapeutic procedure.
The infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, papules and papulovesicles appeared eruptively symmetrically on the extremities.
The virus serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, whereas the serology for hepatitis B virus was negative.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are primarily based on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces, such as dislocation, subluxation and discus dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
Temporomandibular joint dislocations have been described as a complication in a number of neurological disorders.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Fire marks can lead to considerable psychosocial stress.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, quality of life and physical experience of patients with fire marks and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A psychological test was carried out on 70 patients with fire marks as part of the therapy with the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser on the areas of disease management, quality of life and physical experience.
The clinical goal criterion was the degree of whitening of the fire mark over the course of therapy.
In terms of social anxiety, patients with fire marks had comparably high levels of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the firemark.
In terms of helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, patients were significantly less exposed to fire marks.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and physical experience.
Physical experience is differentially influenced by coping with illness.
Since whitening during the course of laser therapy is significantly correlated with reduced psychosocial stress, flashlamp-pulsed dye laser therapy for fire marks can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) is an independent clinical picture, as the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from nodal lymphoma.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of the PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological manifestations and a wide range of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had a sebaceus nevus in the area of the right temple since birth.
Histopathological examination revealed 2 adnexal neoplasms associated with the lesion:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q waves, new left thigh block) and elevated levels of the “classic heart enzymes” creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementias.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years of age.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the therapeutic course of the disease that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with concomitant hypothyroidism and secondary dementia caused by hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, an aneurysm of the left subclavian artery was successfully eliminated by implanting a balloon-expandable Jostent© peripheral stent graft.
Follow-up monitoring over a year showed very good long-term results with freely perfused stent lumen and completely switched off aneurysm.
A control computed tomography revealed a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stent.
The pyoderma gangrenosum was described as a separate entity for the first time in 1930 by Brunsting, Göckermann and O'Leary.
However, as early as the first half of the 19th century, there are illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost necessarily suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum.
In addition to cases of various forms of syphilitic skin infections, Devergie's “Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique” also contains individual images of gangrenous ulcers, which occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy commonly used at the time.
The rapidly increasing ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this excessive treatment with mercury, as they healed spontaneously after they were discontinued.
As a result, clinical descriptions and illustrations of pyoderma gangrenosum can be found over 100 years before it was first named.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not yet been sufficiently clarified.
This is how the theory of the primary bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangrenosum persisted in several publications until well into the 1960s.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the main selection criteria for anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study deals with the question of whether recovery of cognitive functions is faster after TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/R) than after balanced anesthesia with sevofluran/fentanyl (S/F).
Estradiol concentrations are uniform as in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly fluctuating drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high doses of estrogen when administered orally are necessary because there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism during the passage through the liver.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia and psychomotor retardation, who has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The objectives of the present study were to measure the physical resilience of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-related changes in oxygen saturation.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions and tumors of the urinary bladder was to better reflect the biology of the various lesions and to make a clearer distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The significance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically examined.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
The present study attempts to represent relationships between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation in patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated through sympathetic nervous system intervention.
It is then referred to as pleasantly maintained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and acute herpes zoster.
For people with chronic sleep and back problems, there is a significant relationship between sleep quality and mattress quality.
The routine diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multi-phase abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
If spiral CT findings are unclear in the question of intravenous tumour expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindication to nonionic X-ray contrast media, patients in the stage of compensated renal failure (not yet requiring dialysis), and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of (multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common eye injuries in childhood are burn, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign body, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is around 12 per 100,000 inhabitants per year.
They therefore represent the most common cause of one-sided blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for an eye injury in childhood include age (<5 Jahre), das Geschlecht (männlich > female) and parental care.
In addition to rapid and adequate treatment, the prognosis for visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is also influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance when using vision aids or masking the eyes for amblyopia prevention).
Deficits and imbalances in the spine-stabilizing muscles are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back pain.
Maintaining and restoring the full performance of the muscles that stabilize the spine must therefore be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation, in addition to training coordination skills and learning to behave in a manner appropriate to the spine.
In addition to the various pain management measures, physiotherapy treatment techniques including neurophysiologic-based procedures, physical-balneological measures and supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important method in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In their phase structure, various therapeutic goals are presented, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the course of rehabilitation.
The identification and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
Depending on the underlying disorder and the course of treatment, treatment goals and treatment concepts are adjusted in collaboration with physiotherapists and treating doctors.
The surgical indication for vertebral gliding is pain, progressive gliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and, in the case of spondyloptosis, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass may occur with further progression of sliding.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now also possible to reposition heavy sliding processes and restore normal spine and trunk shape with justifiable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed which, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at the anatomical repositioning of the gliding vertebra in any case.
Depending on the extent of gliding, reposition and stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
A sole dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
Combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended for grade II and above.
The aim of the evaluation study, whose selected results are reported in this article, is to examine the effects of a gerontopsychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient services, day hospital and geriatric counseling) based on the transformation process from “intramural” (inpatient) to “extramural” (day hospital and clinical-outpatient, i.e. home-based) regional care structures required by the Federal Government's expert commission and explained in detail.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional care sub-structures of gerontopsychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and care for the elderly (subsystem C) are analysed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld (excluding GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ).
With regard to subsystem A, the study shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selegating its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
One effect of the GZ on the elderly care system (subsystem C) may be reflected in the fact that the home admission rate in the Gütersloh care region after clinical-inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on her right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and severe movement restriction in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to edema of skin and adipose tissue, ultrasound and computer tomography also revealed extensive fluid accumulations around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitia and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint.
Systemic corticoid therapy resulted in rapid healing of the skin lesions and later on in the recovery of mobility in the shoulder joint.
In the described case, an involvement of structures close to the joint in eosinophilic cellulitis was detected for the first time using modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide enables breast-conserving treatment for larger tumours that are primarily not suitable for breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumour can be monitored with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The good reproducibility and availability speak in favour of mammography.
Tumors that cannot be identified by mammography can usually be visualized ultrasonographically.
In MRI, tumour expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It also allows functional parameters to be recorded. - The determination of the extent of tumour residuals after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopically small invasive and in particular non-invasive tumour remains can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even when the invasive tumour recedes and typically indicate intraductal, non-invasive tumour residuals.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and marked vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to intensive care.
The present report discusses the treatment of severe GBS in intensive care using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be able to immediately induce and thus prevent an incipient dissection.
Neurosurgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PK) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, based on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-track functional model clarifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
Its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus (Nst).
Test lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in MPTP damaged patients. - Both lesional, restorative and stimulative procedures are currently being used in the clinic.
The pallidotomy and thalamotomy techniques that have already been used earlier have become more precise thanks to improved neuroradiological and physiological target positioning.
The former technique is used to treat rigor, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia; the latter method has proven effective for treating tremor.
Only in fetal cell transplantation are new shoots of dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine release documented;
However, the process raises ethical and immunological problems.
High-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is stimulation of thalamic nuclei to treat tremor;
Animal experiments include xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual procedures are required in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic AL coholism (SESA syndrome) is, in addition to more common conditions such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal cramps, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, central Pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome, a rare alcohol sequelae.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic side-stressed steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal attacks on the right side of the body under a suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed elevated levels for gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-fold anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and a worsening of general condition were still observed.
Several EEG studies revealed periodic steep left parietooccipital waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described meets the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinoma in children and adolescents without association with basal cell nevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus or following radiotherapy is very rare (86 cases in world literature to date).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage have not yet been available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma in the right infraorbital region.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical examination gave evidence of a genetic predisposition to the development of basal cell carcinoma.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using iliac crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
On the basis of morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursor cells, with fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already observed in around 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
In a similar way, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of RET40F+ nucleated erythropoietic precursor cells, which can be associated with the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, H‰moglobin synthesis and the breakdown of the emitted normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl rest-expressing) pseudo-gaucher cells could be detected in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fiber with clinical parameters such as hemoglobin levels, the proportion of myelo and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood, and the size of the spleen could be calculated.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification was carried out into three different histological subgroups:
Corresponding dermatological data could be attributed to this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies on 173 patients who received monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU) or busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN in contrast to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment could best be illustrated by calculating indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences between the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the associated time differences.
For example, in patients with complete hematologic remission after IFN administration, erythropoiesis regeneration was observed together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages, including their activated subpopulation.
During ongoing investigations, the histological subgroups revealed a transition from both an (uncomposed) granulocyte and megakaryocyte subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of patients.
This phenomenon contrasted with a number of reductions in myelofibrotic type, particularly in patients receiving HU therapy, in 17 cases (36%).
Taken together, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 patients admitted one after the other to a medical geriatric unit should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination and the values in the mini-mental state examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as not examinable.
The remaining 74 patients were treated clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Demential developments may have been detected or ruled out by neuropsychological tests.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of clinical value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, and in over half of them the disorder was relevant for overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains unclear how the treatment of the mental disorder required for every 5th to 6th patient according to this result can be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, particularly in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnosis of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional x-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method include dependence on investigators, the lack of standardization so far, and the relatively high costs.
For this reason, the “Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology Working Group of the Berlin Regional Rheumatism Center,” which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also explained and radiation exposure and cost effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Job syndrome, Buckley syndrome) is a rare immune system disorder that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically, strongly elevated IgE concentrations in serum are indicative of the simultaneous absence of evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerated and highly effective.
More than a year after a single treatment, symptoms have improved steadily.
The current state of knowledge and available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In the case of hyper-IgE syndrome, a treatment trial with IVIG should be an option of first choice.
The present work presents the results after laparoscopic “floppy Nissen” fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual subdimensions of GLQI have corresponding points scores.
More than 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would, if necessary, undergo another antireflux operation.
Persistent side effects of surgery, which did not impair quality of life, were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required new antireflux drug therapy.
Laparoscopic refundoplication was required in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease using laparoscopic “floppy nits” fundoplication can be documented and proven in the longer term not only through objective findings, but also on the basis of the patient's subjective assessment and by measuring quality of life data.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are groundbreaking, demonstrating the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is enucleation of the tumour or, depending on size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumours and islet cell hyperplasia, which have a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appears to be superior to selective tumour removal.
In malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under Section 216 StGB;
Even from a medical point of view, it is ethically unjustifiable.
The various tendencies to exempt “killing on demand” from punishment in Germany under certain conditions, as in the Netherlands, do not change this.
Nutrient levels as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally differentiated from immunologically active cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in seriously ill patients.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are particularly important as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially fermented in the lower parts of the intestine to form mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These exert a trophic effect on the colon mucosa, among other things, by improving blood flow.
Among the substances independent of food, it is primarily the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to maintaining an eutrophic mucosa.
The following article investigates the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological well-being.
By using a diary as a measurement tool, it was possible to identify, on the one hand, individual assessments of situational influencing factors of care and, on the other hand, stress-promoting impact factors in the care process.
The results show both large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their effects on physical and psychological well-being.
Appendix fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis of acute and chronic ankle pain.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences long-term results.
Computer tomography (CT) is essential to make a definitive diagnosis and to determine the treatment to be taken.
Displaced fractures treated conservatively, as far as described in the literature and according to personal experience, lead to pain and restricted movement and therefore to arthrotic remodeling of the subtalar joint in the long term.
When it comes to indications for an operative procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to enable healing without consequences.
Debris fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unknown, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
For example, proliferation of dermal mast cells and upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can be detected even in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in serum, which indicates systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in adult indolent mastocytosis, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to general assumption, acute urticaria is only rarely caused by IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudo-allergies to foods (73%) and less frequently chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-lasting remissions when avoided (dieting) or elimination of the triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are primarily to be regarded as secondary and not as disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a vitally threatening injury pattern in the context of multiple traumas.
The 3 case reports should present the variability of possible injuries together with scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which can usually only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are presented over the course of multiple trauma management and the differentiated treatment options are pointed out.
Reports from previous working groups in the context of multi-center studies with only a small patient population show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define them as standards; the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to management together with the mostly polytraumatized and therefore vitally endangered patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course over 2 months to 35.2 years is known (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found in higher T stages; there was an increase in synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/> 20%), synchronous remote metastasis (m0/PM1, cM1) and the radicality of the intervention (R0/R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant.
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a risk for adults due to the postponement of the age peak.
MMR combination vaccination is an effective method for preventing this disease and its sequelae.
With 2 consistent MMR vaccination, measles and mumps can be eliminated and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied ageing both in middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.
A regional comparison revealed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region were found for openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement and medical judgment.
Over 80% of intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and are mostly caused after abdominal surgery.
In terms of anatomy, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal abscesses.
With defined indications, sonographically or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is now a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approximately 80%.
Liver abscesses are mainly treated interventionally; pancreatic, spleen and Crohn abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late due to their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
From the middle to the end of the 1980s, various research groups have tried to improve the prognosis of premature birth in premature delivery through immunological diagnostics - in particular through cytokine detection.
However, it has proved to be disadvantageous that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been convincing from amniocentesis, i.e. from amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as shown in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high fluctuation range of the individual biomediators.
Attempts were therefore made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Cytokine detection from the cervix of pregnant women using PCR technology may be a viable option for the future.
The load on the internal fixator on the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found when walking and when doing lateral flexion while standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured when sitting than when standing.
There is therefore little to be said against allowing patients whose spinal column has been mono- or bisegmentally stabilized to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
The additional ventral stabilization with bone chips has often significantly changed the load on the bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often significantly higher after ventral stabilization than before.
A corset or bodice did not reduce the implant load.
It is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a brace after mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumours in adults.
The so-called atypical meningioma was also included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to describe meningiomas with an increased tendency to relapse compared to common meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be subject to certain uncertainties.
We looked for other predictively relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined nuclear-area-related Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 degrees (N=160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the “relapse-free” intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a poorly structured, “syncytial” growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Facultative nuclear pleomorphy, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, had a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of the cases.
Histochemically, we were able to show that the tissue-unspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is 1p, can be used as a progression- and relapse-associated marker enzyme in meningiomas (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term “atypical,” which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and may give rise to misinterpretation in connection with tumour grading, we suggest the term intermediate-type meningiomas for this group of tumours, which is located between the usual and anaplastic meningiomas, which are relatively prone to recurrence.
Because of their particular anatomical situation, joint appendage fractures take on a special position within mandibular fractures.
Computer tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnosis.
The indication for surgical treatment is severely dislocated or dislocated fractures.
The pre-auricular, sub- and perimandibular, retromandibular and oral approaches are established as surgical approaches.
Only functionally stable methods, such as the mini plate or pull screw, should be used to fix the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with primarily focal liver lesions before possible liver surgery.
We report the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas, and palmoplantar keratoses following treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing CSF Fowleri (Fowler's);
Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as a side finding.
Background and question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely insufficiently represented in the basic health services established there.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care System on the prevalence of skin diseases should be investigated.
The rate of growth and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single primary care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL enables a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasias, nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumour in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, to identify risk factors with regard to the occurrence and to assess the benefits of early treatment of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumour manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute episodes.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic courses are often barely manageable.
In addition, the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants, results in numerous treatment-induced side effects.
We report 2 cases of acute exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, which were barely controllable even with high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
In addition to immunosuppression, both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins.
In both cases, the immunosuppressants originally used in high doses (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) could be suppressed up to minimal maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained symptom-free under minimal immunosuppressive maintenance treatment with prednisolone over the follow-up period of 1 year.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is therefore one of the most common symptoms in childhood.
However, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is used primarily in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood light has been used by adding fluorescent markers in the administration control of topicals.
When hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced as part of programmed ventricular stimulation, endocardial mapping is possible.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the cycle through stimulation maneuvers (“entrainment mapping”) and analysis of the “post-pacing” interval.
In the case of clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in approximately 60-70% of cases due to high-frequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is significantly lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, a relapse must be expected.
In the case of continuous (“incessant”) ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia following the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator, early catheter ablation is indicated.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapeutic method to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future through new mapping and ablation techniques.
From January 1, 1985 to December 31, 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumour staging and local recurrence rate was examined retrospectively in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma after conventional surgical procedures and R0 resection of the tumour.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant relationship between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, and therefore a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and the PTXPN2 category (p = 0,000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be detected for UICC stages I and II.
In the overall medical records and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no effect on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a shift in stages as part of more precise tumour staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically modifiable factors, in particular total mesorectal excision, on the development of locoregional recurrence.
Echocardiography has so far lacked uniform standards for reporting findings.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings so that quality assurance requirements in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidence rates of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
However, tuberculosis remains the most common infectious disease worldwide.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, particularly as a result of the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir of tuberculosis.
Scarring pemphigoid (cicatricial pemphigoid, CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring, which manifests itself on the skin and mucous membranes.
Eye involvement is present in around 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have been known in the literature for a long time as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The discovery of these abscesses using echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
As with other diseases, asymptomatic courses of endocarditis are known (18, 19, 20, 21), but clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its initial description is also increasingly affecting areas of dermatology.
Due to its particular effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear to be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumour cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to be able to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells and lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
This overview will outline molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as prospects for applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
It was investigated whether high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, omniscan) is suitable for contrast-assisted magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After an introductory discussion of reasons for increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, the first part outlines six research trends relevant to everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those by Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative concept of everyday competence is presented, which combines aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two models of everyday competence.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumour control with increasing overall treatment time for fractional radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of clonogenic cell proliferation during radiation treatment could therefore potentially achieve significant advances in radiation oncology.
In a brief overview, the options for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways, or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness for minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not yet been proven.
The only currently reliable method is to carry out radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. by accelerating fractionation and by preventing or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour of admission and at intervals of 4-24h for TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge for the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Results:
The cumulative event rate for patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge was 62.5% compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
Logistic regression with regard to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24h), age, sex and diagnosis revealed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1 µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis AMI was 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP over the 4-24h course. Conclusions:
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are of little use for acute infarction diagnosis.
However, the assessment of patients' prognosis with TnT is significantly independently supplemented and thus significantly improved using CRP 4-24h after admission.
A 51/2 year old girl with optic glioma and resulting internal hydrocephalus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was found in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disturbance of the blood-CSF barrier was found to be the cause of the increased CSF protein using CSF protein electrophoresis.
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, liver damage with portal hypertension increases the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion-requiring conduit bleeding.
While diagnosis is simple, there are various treatment options available.
The source of bleeding is usually in varice-like dilated vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerotherapy with 3% ethoxysclerol or stopping the bleeding vessel is appropriate.
Resection of the varicentral conduit portion is an option in the case of life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumour cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes — proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes — whose detection can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterized solid tumors:
Species-specific, a number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known, which are associated with clinical parameters such as the tendency of meningiomas to relapse or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression, which is particularly typical of gliomas, which results in intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also determined iatrogenically through radiation or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnoea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) 6 years earlier due to mitral stenosis III.
3 years later, valve thrombosis occurred, which required valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumour progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial structure through loss of cell-cell adhesion, the invasion of the extracellular matrix through proteolysis, and through entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumour cells is promoted by angiogenetic factors, which can lead to degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and the induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastatic process.
In addition, a tumour cell will only survive when it enters the circulation if it escapes immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumour antigens has opened up new opportunities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is assumed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes, whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumours in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 is most common between the ages of 20 and 35, primarily due to hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies focused on reducing endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different methods of preserving donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, as very variable follow-up intervals were summarized despite dynamic cell loss, which had been known for a long time.
The aim of this study was to carry out a long-term endothelial diagnosis at the same dates, taking into account 2 different conservation techniques.
Patients taking long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a varying risk of perioperative thromboembolism, which requires continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective procedures, coumarin administration is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively; emergency procedures require vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution.
Surgery for patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic, as the heparin effect subsides within a few hours when discontinued.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
When the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies are transferred to the total population of Germany, estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients are estimated.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems with patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded through a representative survey of physician groups that are relevant for the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of opportunity to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent combination of the results of the survey of the individual doctor groups resulted in a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of that of Poser et al.
127 excluding the diagnostic category “questionable MS” and 170 including this diagnostic category.
Here, it was examined how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce increased growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be regarded as a promising new technique of in situ tissue engineering, which can be expected to be used clinically in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the general practitioner.
The quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of decisive importance for diagnosis and treatment.
While in the 1970s, the doctor's conversation style was regarded as a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversation suggest that the doctor's conversation behavior should be understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners (physician-patient) coordinate their conversation behavior.
Training programs to improve basic psychosomatic competence in primary care often show little success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of the Düsseldorf training and training program for primary psychosomatic care.
The training concept and experiences with it are finally presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological investigations as well as clinical intervention studies.
All of these sources can only be transferred to everyday clinical practice to a limited extent.
Programming the speech processor of a “cochlear implant” (CI) in young children, especially determining the stimulation strength that corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation should be avoided at all costs, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds, which were triggered via the CI, and the MAL and hearing threshold values determined during postoperative speech processor adjustment in 27 wearers of three different types of implants.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold is an applicable, objective instrument for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants irritated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as the percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed, in some cases, large deviations from the thresholds determined effectively by behavioral audiometric means.
As a result, no reliable and simple calculation of MAL and hearing threshold based on the intraoperative SR threshold was possible.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative functional control, can contribute to a computational restriction of the area to be examined.
However, the exact MAL will have to be determined by other means, for the time being, by behavioral audiometric means.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swellings in the red parts of a multi-colored decorative tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was impressive, which could be differentiated from real lymphoma by electron microscopy, immunohistochemical and molecular biological investigations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be the result of dermal-allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic options in the kidney area using rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
For 8 years, a 34-year-old patient had developed a chicken-egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland, bulging the skin, without buds or areola-free supernumerary glands in the left anterior axillary line.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are welcome.
In connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complications as well as the treatment used are described.
The vascular status of the extremities should be assessed before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively alienating convictions with a tendency to subjective certainty, which, as an object of psychiatric experience, lose their disconcerting character with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusion emerges are dynamically charged according to their position in a structural context.
The pressure to update, which burdens the imagination and increases in psychotic constitutions, is a precondition for delusion.
In addition, there must be the failure of disactualization caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by casuistry, which start from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor that was described in the lung for the first time.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing obstruction due to thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumour was found in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed on the basis of an overview of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice consists of complete surgical resection of the tumour.
In the presented study, we therefore present options for examining finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers using color-coded duplex ultrasonography.
The question was whether a standardized display of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that visualization was possible in all test subjects (n=10).
By way of example, it is also shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this size can be detected using the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technology.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for a new implantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery exhaustion and no episode of clinical arrhythmia during the period of operation of the initial implanted system.
The use of new extracorporeal circulation technologies, new specialized instruments, and the use of intrathoracic visualization systems make it possible to perform operations on the mitral valve via a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculo-aponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but not metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role as a cause.
Preferred locations are the trunk and the parts of the extremities close to the trunk.
By combining different imaging methods, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumour, the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few.
While surgical resection had a monopoly position in previous years, adjuvant therapeutic measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are being given more and more importance.
Mutilating procedures and procedures with subsequent loss of function are only justified when repeated, uncontrollable relapses occur.
The treatment concept for atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbed atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in the case of treatment-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
An exacerbation can often be successfully countered phototherapeutically, in particular through UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents such as glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporin or azathioprine can generally be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or represent a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present case report describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented himself with watery nasal secretions, recurrent epistaxis and slowly progressive, left-handed nasal breathing obstruction to the ENT department of BWk Ulm for clarification.
The clinical examination and CT of the sinuses revealed a tumour that filled the entire left nasal cavity and apparently started from the middle nasal passage.
The tumour was resected in toto via a midfacial degloving.
Histological processing resulted in the diagnosis of neurinoma.
On the basis of this case report and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and treatment of this rare nasal tumour are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical treatment procedures for lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse, but they sometimes lead to considerable adverse effects.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding, and lateral myelitis.
This must be taken into account when prescribing chemonucleolysis and when educating patients.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully cryosurgically treated.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low-impact treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a treatment alternative to systemic treatment with dapsone.
Based on the questions of need, utilization and effectiveness of psychosomatic consulting/liaison services, the effectiveness of psychosomatic-dermatological consulting services was examined in more detail for the first time in the present study.
The extent of compliance after treatment recommendation was recorded and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as frequency of interview contacts, preference and satisfaction with the consultation, as well as clinical and demographic characteristics, was examined.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
A sample of a total of n=69 patients with recommended action resulted in a compliance rate of 78.3%, based on the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation, a rate of 69%.
There was no significant relationship with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of interview contacts have any influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was conducted.
A positive approach to consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had a positive effect on compliance.
Overall, a high level of effectiveness could therefore be achieved with relatively little expenditure of time and effort.
It is reported about a 29-year-old patient with an unusual pigment mark on her face.
In clinical terms, the pigment lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus; in histological diagnosis, the existence of multiple blue nevi could be confirmed, and there was also a slight lentiginous component as well as dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus proves to be an unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than would be expected through preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid losses and ventilation.
Changes in Starling forces — particularly in vascular permeability — may play a role here, without these being investigated in more detail so far.
The discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, in particular about surgery-related complications, such as the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to less invasive methods being sought and used in the past, particularly for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on various intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal intervertebral disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed for clinical use since the 1970s.
The results in patient treatment vary from around 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results, depending on the author and study.
It is remarkable that the prospective randomized trials that have comparison groups — whether conservatively or surgically treated patient groups — are very rare.
Here, the results of intradiscal treatment procedures are rated more critically and with lower success figures than the presentations of individual techniques, some of which have been examined retrospectively, and which, although often have very large numbers of cases, are unable to meet the tough scientific criteria of study design well.
Overall, it can be stated that percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a partial area of lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At present, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their value when used after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU is 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% each.
The hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8 h, 4-7 h and 2-6 h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems was able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all have documented a significant decrease in haemostasis time.
The improved well-being of patients is mainly due to lock removal immediately after coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by reducing the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy to relieve the macula of the presumed intravitréal tensile forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also removed the internal limitan membrane (MLI) near the foramen from the retina for some time now.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and primary dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with a left thigh block, a non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, a hospital time of >= 12 h, or an unknown PR hospital time.
To describe these patient groups and to compare the effects of lysis and prim‰r dilation, we examined the data from the “Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction” (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died of fulminant viral hepatitis in a hepatic coma 5 days after the onset of the first symptoms.
Serological diagnosis revealed healed hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection with the delta virus (delta hepatitis only detected post-mortem).
This has led to protracted fat embolism (over days) into the pulmonary circulation with consecutive extravasation and deposition of fat in alveolar macrophages.
The tau protein was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid in 40 Alzheimer patients, 5 patients with dementias of other causes and 36 cognitively inconspicuous control persons.
Of the Alzheimer patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total score 25 to 28 points in the mini mental state test).
In these, too, a significant increase in tau was measured compared to the control subjects.
There was a less pronounced increase in tau in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer's patients, there was no quantitative relationship between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or the cerebral perfusion deficit, as determined by SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau may also be elevated in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and are suitable as a biological indicator for early diagnosis.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis was described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis, especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or usually systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically impressive subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustulations.
The present work describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem after reconstructive vascular surgery.
Proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Reduced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by extending the survival time of intimate cells, resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples from 25 primary and 14 restenosis lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were tested using TUNEL test (TDT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As a key finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Interestingly, ultrastructural investigations showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, in particular smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological characteristics for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In contrast, there was no difference between the two types of plaque in the incidence of necrosis (0.13 vs. 0.12 necroses/cell;
Our data therefore point to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying form of cell death, with differences between both lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The available findings suggest that reduced apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimate hyperplasia, as is usually shown in human restenoses after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
Cytotoxic lymphocytes are followed by a detailed description of the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is estimated at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been rising steadily for years.
The prognosis depends largely on rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the usually diagnostically groundbreaking clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy that has been started unintentionally and the blood culture techniques used be reviewed or the use of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative agent.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, particularly when substances with a potentiating toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so that they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially when the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg/ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical symptoms of endocarditis, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolisms are not a contraindication to surgery with a heart-lung machine if a primary cerebral haemorrhage has been ruled out using a cranial computer tomogram and the operation is performed early before a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder develops (< 72 hours).
A considerable improvement in the prognosis due to early surgical intervention is also proven for diseases complicated by myocardial insufficiency (particularly as a result of acute valve insufficiency), by the occurrence of acute kidney failure, an infection of primary aortic valve vegetations on the anterior mitral membrane, or sepsis that persists for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, as the large, “cystic” ventricles of the brain can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain, in which there is either an increased or a reduced amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act puts the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new basis.
Both certain symptoms of suspicion, illness or death must be reported (mainly by doctors) and laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by reporting persons with the notification.
It also determines which information of this information may be passed on by the health department.
In particular, in the case of suspicious reports or when reporting pathogen evidence, not all information required to be transmitted is already available as a result of the report, so the health department must carry out investigations itself in these cases in order to be able to provide the appropriate information.
Health authorities also have the task of merging incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and transmitting them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information required to submit.
The transmission to the RKI is then made via the competent state authority appointed by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of tumour diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
People with cancer usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological functional disorders, which lead to a significant loss of quality of life if treatment is inadequate or absent.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his relatives.
Although there are treatment concepts for sufficient pain management from various organizations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain management as a crucial cornerstone in palliative care.
Because of the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases result in reduced levels of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors in laboratory analysis and signs of an increased turnover of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic treatment of the hemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxiae, clinically bleeding usually occurs with more or less consumption coagulpathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like findings and thromboembolism only exceptionally.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after seamless corneal cataract surgery
As part of fall prevention, a routine review of medication is required, among other things.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age, it was examined how frequently medicines are prescribed that may increase the risk of falling by possibly triggering dizziness.
Between the individual heart centers, the amount of bleeding differs by up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive rebleeding results in an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
Preventing preoperative anaemia, tolerating low haemoglobin, using autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol reduces the use of allogeneic transfusions.
Perioperative maintenance and rapid recovery of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical guidelines of the European Union.
With persistent efforts and great efforts, oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the member states and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to its work, maxillofacial surgery is now, at the end of the 20th century, recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with around 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not rare.
However, the spread of fungi into the middle ear can result in serious complications.
It is therefore absolutely necessary to renovate the external auditory canal, particularly preoperatively.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparative solutions, “E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for i.v. infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for eye surgery, were examined with regard to their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.
The mean age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As an underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and survived resuscitation in ventricular fibrillation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients, and an AV sequential or two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
A subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted in 25 patients and an epicardial patch system was implanted in 2 patients, 92 patients had an abdominal site of implantation and 248 pectoral.
33 patients (9.7%) experienced a total of 34 probe-related complications over the course.
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications with dual-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 12% was three times as high as with single-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 4% (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate treatment delivery, pain) and one fifth (21%) based on electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
In contrast to conventional computer tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not rotate mechanically around the patient, but an electron beam is directed onto targets arranged semicircularly around the patient, where the actual X-ray radiation is then generated.
With this ultrafast technology, it has become possible to generate axial cross-section images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution of <0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cross-sections (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in brief respiratory arrest allows a complete, three-dimensional image of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcification with EBT must be regarded as currently the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis, including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for evaluating the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
Assuming a stable sinus rhythm, the main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen in respiratory and movement artefacts as well as superposition of the coronary arteries by veins and due to pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, EBT has already enabled clinically evaluable, non-invasive images of coronary arteries, which may be further optimized through further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become the vessel of choice over the last 25 years.
In addition to the established method of angiography, duplex ultrasonography has increasingly been used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method to examine this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, compared to angiography, the examination results were consistent in a high proportion of patients.
While in the preoperative phase, the current pulse curve profile corresponding to the arterial supply to a skeletal muscle is dominated by a high systolic portion, there is a postoperative adjustment to the coronary artery flow bed in the form of an increased diastolic flow rate.
These non-invasive transthoracic duplex sonography findings were confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex ultrasonography when evaluating the results of revascularization after surgery.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male, hypertonic patients over 60 years of age, who typically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are extremely rare.
Here, young patients with or without a previous history of immediate trauma predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the middle cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, taking into account the cases described in the literature, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed.
The article shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old people's and nursing homes.
The adjustment is intended to strengthen the customer focus of homes, profile their core competencies and accelerate the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models; it is the task of the governing bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
A phenotypically female newborn born born in the 37th week of pregnancy is reported, who died on the 14th day of life under the image of renal failure.
The child had a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the end of the 1960s, accidents have been among the most common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in western industrial nations.
While accidents involving older children and adolescents usually occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded and documented, there is no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents involving infants and young children, which occur primarily during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations among 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
Two cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts are reported, which had caused a lumbar giform symptom for many years.
In both cases, there was a urination disorder in the sense of pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Imaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed, on the one hand, by the difficulty of image evaluation and, on the other hand, by the fact that only one layer per heartbeat can be imaged using conventional techniques.
New developments in both magnetic resonance imaging and strategies for accelerated image acquisition make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echoplanar sequence with a previous saturation pulse is discussed and results are presented in an infarct patient.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based perfusion determination for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is reinforced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining heart function parameters.
Since the circulation conditions in ligament ruptures represent an important parameter, particularly with regard to the chances of success of surgical treatment, the vascularization of the inner knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The specific circulation situation was examined using microangiography on 21 cadaveric specimens.
This showed a supply of 1 or 2 main vascular trunks to the proximal part of the ligament, which preferably ran in the ventral ligament parts.
Vascular density declined from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal ligament parts, we would recommend ligament reconstruction using fibrin adhesive, which allows atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture induced vascular strangulation.
Every year, around 75,000 patients with coronary heart disease (approx. 75% of all heart operations) are surgically treated in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, primarily the great saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, yet today saphenectomy is performed largely by continuous incision of the skin from ankle to groin for open dissection of the great saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders following open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every post-coronary surgery treatment and a reason for upgrading new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified “bridge” technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high level of patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only minor limitation caused by the saphenectomy wound (s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal part of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, mamille and mammary.
To the best of our knowledge, a total of seven cases of co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
This study should examine whether SiCAM-1 and SE selectin levels can predict impending sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis at an early stage.
The range of ophthalmic journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the various journals and publishers are very different in terms of quality and quantity.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including low production costs and rapid availability of information regardless of location and time.
It can be assumed that online publications will not replace print versions, but they will be a useful addition to the existing range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation following a “police attack”.
The present case report describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aortoenteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after the implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The pre-operative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of pre-operative diagnosis and the 2 alternative surgical treatment methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of the PGD, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics in Germany.
Proponents are of the opinion that, under certain legal perspectives, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude PGD.
Against the background of this situation, a PGD has not yet been carried out in Germany.
The heated discussion that has been going on in Germany for a long time is difficult to communicate in scientific circles abroad.
Based on case reports, it could be assumed that the muscle relaxant potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic purulent site.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective clinical investigation.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unknown origin (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C for at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient treatment.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly by hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
The present work presents profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure.
With the help of a rapidly hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measurement area, impressions of the skin are produced that correspond to their negative image.
In the subsequent metrological process, the “roughness” of the skin print is measured with the “profilometer” and the result is recorded as a graph.
Using a statistics program, the metrological data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to prove possible improvements in skin surface condition following the use of estrogen-containing creams on the face.
Summary The distribution ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol.
In an extensive multi-center study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in which blood samples are ordered in connection with offences under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of the cases, the ratio was between 1.13 and 1.19. Based on the mean value, the variance in the quotient is less than 3% in 96% of the cases.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but are quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunt via an open foramen oval or an atrial septal defect is typically the basis.
Polymorphic symptoms of children, which change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery, are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different types of therapy is only possible through the use of generally accepted assessment standards.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital delivery by palpation of wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and derivation of the Doppler signal via the wrist arteries.
In the first step, the emergency operations for all 10 children included fragment reposition and fixation with crossed K-wires via extensor access.
The subsequent assessment of blood flow resulted in a pulse recovery (transient, dislocation-related vascular occlusion) in 2 of the 10 children.
8 of the 10 children had no pulse, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we saw vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In adventitial strangulations (2 of these 5 children), the pulse transfer to the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective tissue, strangulating tissues.
In the case of intimal damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with venous patch plasty.
We saw a combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
During the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses in 9 children could be palpated; 9 children had a physiological signal using color duplex ultrasound, 1 child had a pathological monophasic signal over the brachial artery, radial artery and ulnar artery.
Ischemic damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann's contracture) was not found in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility resulted in a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees) and normal supination and supination on the same side.
The supporting joint axis was normal in all children compared to the sides.
The cultural evidence of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to pediatricians, as pathogen growth is only successful in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the results are only available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumours.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400 mg RRR--tocopherol acetate/d) against diclofenac sodium (3x50 mg/d) was tested in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, both with vitamin E therapy (n=42) and with treatment with diclofenac (n=43), a significant improvement in all clinical parameters examined was observed.
The duration of morning stiffness was reduced from 90 minutes to 68 minutes under vitamin E therapy, and from 68 minutes to 30 minutes when taking diclofenac.
The Ritchie joint index declined from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac).
Grip strength increased both in the vitamin E group and in the diclofenac group.
There was also a significant reduction in the severity of pain in both groups, as assessed on the basis of a 10 cm visual analog scale.
The overall assessment of treatment success by doctor and patient was similarly positive for the two medicines.
Particularly against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, taking high-dose vitamin E is a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be filled with air or even overinflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in newborns is shown.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary foregut abnormality.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal closure and by Doppler ultrasonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic patient repeatedly fell into severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l, respectively) within a few weeks as part of intoxication with synthetic drugs (“Ecstasy” and “Speed”).
In decompensated diabetic metabolism (HbA1c initially 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, when the first ketoacidosis manifested, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate hydration.
In addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia, the clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and delusions of persecution are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte, and insulin substitution.
The processes were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variance of a smeloff cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation is reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellowish discoloration, creasing and cracking due to swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthetic dysfunction with complete valve thrombosis.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus roller were treated arthroscopically on an outpatient basis and monitored after 4 and 12 months in accordance with a standardized protocol.
It was shown that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement to be made about the stage of osteochondrosis and its location.
Although over half of the foci were located in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, they could be reached without ankle osteotomy, puncturing of the tibia or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes on the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical results make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle joint.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while pulmonary edema is already greater.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used therapeutically.
However, the mortality rate of cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is > 85%.
In a double-blind study involving 31 volunteers, cognitive performance disorders were quantitatively measured after a single oral dose of 15 mg midazolam using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT).
Some of the disorders corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transition syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, all test subjects experienced complete anterograde amnesia with no tendency to lighten.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident in the evidence of gross spinning nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 test subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam use.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and findings distribution and for video conferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a very good quality visualization of the extracranial carotid current path in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in routine clinical practice.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be displayed without contrast medium.
With intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium, the use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables first-pass visualization of the carotids from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s measurement time.
In the present work, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-assisted MRA (CE-MRA), the correct time of the amount and flow rate of contrast medium (KM) injection and the adjustment of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid return of blood from the venous sinuses into the vv. jugular must be taken into account.
First, the optimal time for data acquisition with regard to the presence of KM in the arteries was determined using a model and in a computer simulation.
It was found that 90% of the contrast is defined in the average 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By gradually varying local resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on test subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid current path.
The best qualitative results were achieved with a double-dose technique at an injection rate of 2 ml/s.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further investigations into the optimal KM application are still pending, while the state of the art is still very early on.
Various pre-, intra- and post-operative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase following the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels, including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of transplant surgery.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Postoperative measures include immediate passive knee extension, early start of an exercise program, and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided if the measures mentioned above are taken into account.
As part of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliating gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical treatment options play an important role.
The focus is on restoring the passage, ensuring the outflow of secretions and reducing pain.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative treatment options.
In many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present work describes and discusses current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliating patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition among sick elderly people is one of the most common and least noticed illnesses in hospitals, nursing homes or in home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the examined patient population, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% is reported.
Especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, this leads to a lack of energy and, in combination, to general malnutrition.
To accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutrition parameters.
These enable tailored nutritional therapy.
The most important deficiencies in elderly patients concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition extends hospital stays, causes enormous healthcare costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in elderly people, the problem of malnutrition will worsen.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as an independent disease and integrating it into the curriculum for the training of doctors and nurses.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows ELND as an independent prognostic factor in addition to tumour thickness (Breslow) (alternatively PT category), tumour location and sex of the tumour carrier.
In stratification according to the forecast parameters mentioned above, the “observed survival curves” according to Kaplan Meier “with” and “without ELND” differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, chest and acras;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same location and with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on arms, legs and abdomen (excluding acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the risk area with a forecast benefit can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations taking into account additional parameters for the preparation of indications.
Drivers license applicants are required not only to have adequate eyesight, but also to use it in legal terms.
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, adopting a forced head-looking posture or using other compensatory mechanisms.
However, he is not allowed to do these in particular in accordance with the applicable investigation guidelines (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retained vellus hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retained keratin and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent separate clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that mainly occurs in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be histologically represented using Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, partly ulcerated nodules.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules and bony changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in a reduction of all symptoms of the disease.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, ventral column stabilization and spondylodesis was performed using thoracoscopic techniques.
As a result of an increase in experience, surgery times were significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients converted to the open procedure.
Our own experience demonstrates the fundamental feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Significant advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and a shorter inpatient stay.
Objective of surgery Exercise-stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid, intramedullary locking medullary nail using an undrilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to a narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for assessment of acromion shape in three-dimensionally reconstructed computer tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased sides.
The acromion form was compared with the Bigliani classification in a conventional X-ray image.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis summarizes various diseases, which should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be differentiated from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often caused by bacteria, no pathogen can be detected in the second group.
In particular, multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to relapse, have a long course and may also show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumors and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There is no histological differentiation between these forms of chronic osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically ageing society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional guidance and has triggered the search for a consensus and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG lambda L chains, an early component of complement C1q and discrete C3 deposits along the resulting elastic fibers in the dermis, particularly in the stratum papillary, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in literature.
The hand is extremely exposed during daily use and is therefore also highly exposed to injuries.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most serious injuries, only residual or replacement functions can very often be gained.
Complex trauma to the hand results in combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with an acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, comprehensive primary care is sought.
Because of the multiple damage, the focus is on extensive débridement.
As far as possible, the destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced by a stalked or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of a long period of ischemia, this concept is abandoned to the extent that blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
When it comes to the healing result of a complex hand injury, every regained or created function of the hand counts.
It is therefore not responsible to provide care for such a serious injury to a special department without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local conditions.
According to the results of 5 large, randomized trials, treatment of symptomatic coronary multivascular disease with balloon dilation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, after PTCA, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
According to the BARI study, the mortality rate was lower in diabetic patients in the operated group over the long term.
The individual treatment recommendation by the treating physician has also proven to be an important factor for the patient's prognosis.
The impact of newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in other large-scale randomized trials.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata, which occurred after a period of 4 years after pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, is reported.
In order to investigate the possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases from the group of parapsoriatic changes and with regard to their relationship to low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T-cell type, we carried out histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases had characteristic histological changes and a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor could not be ensured within both changes.
We therefore interpret both diseases as separate entities and, in this case, unrelated to low-malignant T-cell type non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
A histological statement on the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resectate margin (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and unequivocal as possible.
We report on 2 technical tools that, in our experience, are particularly useful for breast excisates:
1) Radiopaque threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy.
When sevoflurane comes into contact with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthetic circuit parts, compound A is produced, which could have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted on volunteers aimed at analyzing the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
A total of three studies on test subjects investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% by volume, using fresh gas flows of approx. 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from renal tubule cells in the urine of test subjects after sevoflurane.
The subsequent investigations then found either no relevant changes or even no changes at all in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3% by volume of sevoflurane in test subjects, which had been administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
When translating these results into clinical practice, account must always be taken of the experimental nature of the anaesthesia used in these studies.
Although the topic of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies among volunteers, as well as the results of new clinical trials, suggest that kidney function after surgical procedures under low-flow conditions is similar to that after isoflurane.
So far, there has been no published experience in the treatment of paraphilias (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse acts with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in German-speaking countries.
In this study, we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate over a period of 12 months.
There were no further sexually aggressive acts during the treatment period and, according to the patients, there was a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
A patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its potential carcinogenic effects.
We therefore examined the effectiveness of five different intraoperative heating measures.
Baker and colleagues used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty for the first time in 1984.
With the UltraPulse CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty both by phlebography and by duplex ultrasonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigator.
Both methods are available nationwide in Germany.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnosis, but duplex ultrasonography has become of paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography is essential.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and duplex findings are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the use of the two methods is practised as a “golden partnership” when comprehensive documentation is required.
The chronic rejection reaction is the most important unsolved problem of kidney transplantation today.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or re-epithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in transplant vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor even several years after transplantation.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which consist primarily of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the Doppler sonographic assessment of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized as one of the methods to shorten the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the Federal Medical Association.
A survey was intended to clarify the extent to which Doppler ultrasonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler ultrasonography is also used as a decision-making tool to determine brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, “yes” was ticked 5 times.
The discussion revealed that the investigators deliberately reported borderline situations in which, in some cases, the conditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases was ultrasound examination used to determine brain death.
Doppler ultrasonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for diagnosing brain death, essentially to further confirm the diagnosis, less frequently as the sole method that shortens the waiting time.
Only microsomal haemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32), is responsible for the endogenous formation of CO.
In the present work, therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was investigated.
Glycerol leads to a conversion of crystalline lipid structures in the corneal layer lipids into liquid-crystalline states.
Especially when used in O/W emulsion, it improves horny layer hydration to a considerable extent and significantly exceeds the urea effect.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus corneal layer exfoliation.
The deformation of the skin in the suction test can be increased by glycerol, especially in long-term use.
The roughness of the skin surface is also affected by glycerol-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerol also has a protective effect against the action of surfactants and against lipophilic pollutants.
This may be due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol results in a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerol, similar to urea, can lead to an improvement in drug penetration.
Objective of surgery Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents through a posterior bone block and capsular plasty.
Long-term complications resulting from venous graft degeneration can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to extended operating times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have only been used in exceptional cases so far.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Material and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multivascular disease were completely arterially revascularized in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral thoracic arteries, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracic artery and radial artery in 299 patients (73.8%) and 1 radial artery in 1 patient (0.3%).
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in the T-configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
The hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternal wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Apart from temporary paresthesia, there were no complications after removal of the radial artery.
In angiographic monitoring 1 week postoperative, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses > 50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe method for treating coronary multivascular disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow them to be used routinely.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic femoral fracture following endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method for treating such periprostetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has taken on a key role in neuromonitoring, although intracranial pressure does not allow the actual metabolic processes on the central neuron to be registered directly or even with a time delay.
Reliable intracranial pressure measurement requires specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which will be examined below.
These will be analysed and categorised from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functions and measurement properties.
We perform partial sphincterectomy as part of cataract surgery with very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is primarily caused by a fibrosing ring of the pupillary sphincter muscle.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly being researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present work, works published in literature on the topic of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to focal points and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work is scarce so far, and the existing measurement instruments for the quality of life of children are described.
Increased research activities are needed to be able to use recording the quality of life of children in prevention, health sciences, treatment evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasion in 1957 due to skin changes, which must be regarded as incipient rhinophyma based on the available biographical material.
Throughout his artistic career, the artist's involvement with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the nose area, can be proven.
As a founder of pop art, Warhol has had a significant impact on modern society with his entire work and has also influenced our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the HEPAvision program (MEVIS, Bremen), specially developed for 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and liver donations.
Experience with the program is available so far for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
Since active non-specific immunotherapy has had an adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the option of active specific immunotherapy.
It includes gene transfer, which can take place virally or non-virally, in vivo or ex vivo.
The following are suitable for melanoma:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or “naked DNA,” vaccination with melanoma cells that have been transfused with a cytokine gene or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transplanted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transsexuection of tumour cells in vivo with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies (“defense”) of some patients on the evaluation of treatment results has not yet been precisely estimated.
The extent to which raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales are influenced by patients' defensive attitudes measured with validity scales for the MMPI-K, FPI-R and Giessen test personality tests is shown in 309 patients treated with inpatient attitudes and followed up one year later:
the tendency to present oneself in a favourable light (“social desirability”) and the tendency to appear unobtrusive and normal.
Their relative improvements (effect sizes rating scales) are lower as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient conversational psychotherapy strengthened the immune system in aggravating patients and reduced it in dissimulating patients.
Despite conservative and subsequent timely surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, approximately 25% of recurrence and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause appears to be the lack of concentric repositioning and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
Based on the experience of 94 operated relapse/residual clubfeet (patients < 10 years), the age-related surgical procedure is presented.
After 8 to 10 years of age, metatarsal osteotomies, Ilizarov correction with an external fixator and, as a last resort, triplearthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show marked variability in their clinical morphs.
We report on a 77-year-old patient with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
We suggest the term “Nevus corymbiformis” for this grape-shaped appearance.
For ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in transfusion services, individual patient fate), the development and consistent use of foreign blood saving measures in medicine is a challenge for anesthetists, surgeons and transfusion doctors.
The combination of various methods, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthetic method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative administration of antifibrinolytics and automatic autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, makes it possible to spare allogeneic blood transfusion even patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Childbirth Center and Midwifery School, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He focused research and teaching on what was empirically comprehensible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of pelvic dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis rhombus named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis of the risks associated with the birth process.
His research was characterized by honesty and conscientiousness:
He published medical failures self-critically and critically examined new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis' teaching on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
Out of despair over the death of many female patients in childbirth, which he was partly responsible for, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumour may be responsible for a long-known conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can trigger temporary stimulation effects in areas of the cortex described in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for safety of use are made.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors, which usually occur along the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow extratemporally and are then noticed extracranially as a space requirement.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, a progressive sensory disorder on the left, and mild peripheral facial palsy without a deficit of lacrimal secretion.
The neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Using an extradural “middle fossa approach”, the tumour was removed without injuring the motor facial nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the major petrosus nerve without affecting the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) is when there is a continuous seizure or multiple seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients; if unsuccessful, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used.
Therapeutic refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the option of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternative active substances.
To treat an outdated rupture of the tendon of the anterior tibial muscle, either a tendon transplant or a tendon transplant is recommended.
Using a case study, surgical care with augmented reversive plasty is described;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with good functional results.
Reversible plastic has the advantage that there is no functional loss compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies for many diseases.
This parameter is measured in intensive care patients primarily by analyzing heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies.
Ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities, on the other hand, as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these symptoms.
Sepsis and MODS, as diseases particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction (“uncoupling of biological oscillators”).
This idea seems to be becoming increasingly attractive in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report on 3 patients with acquired green discoloration of head hair.
The medical history showed that all 3 patients bathed regularly in the private swimming pool.
The examination of the hair using atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
Based on our observations, we would like to draw attention to the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by swimming water in our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint sheet, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measurement values were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
This parameter improved just 6 weeks postoperatively, and 74% of the transplants found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
The patients were also very dissatisfied with physical performance (87%) and health status (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after the transplant, these areas improved significantly, 76% of the patients showed a high level of satisfaction with their health and 51% with their physical capacity.
Although patients rated their mental health as good even before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and achieved significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R) =3.78 vs. 12 months post-stop.
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities improved after HTx in only about 28% of patients.
90% suffered from one or more symptoms after the transplant, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with end-stage heart failure, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental health are significantly improved just 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite too high expectations and post-operative complaints, heart transplants are significantly more satisfied with their post-operative living situation.
After falling on a bicycle, a 36-year-old man suffered an isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and contusion bleeding [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-consuming hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP levels required a barbiturate coma for 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic respiratory failure on the 8th day after trauma.
The patient had a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
In the following period, the patient developed a massive limitation of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction/adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
The pelvic survey and computer tomography showed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV).
Two years after the accident, the HO were removed twice in each case via a Smith-Petersen access.
HO recurrence prevention was achieved by means of a single preoperative radiotherapy (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/day) over 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints is as follows 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can carry out light activities as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed.
The primers “TR1" and “TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that codes for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
PCR was used to amplify the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, as well as that of some yeast and molds.
By hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides, dermatophytes and Candida albicans were identified.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed dermatophytes to be differentiated from yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined using PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected in 35 of the 38 positively rated patient samples using PCR and in 28 of the 38 positively rated patient samples using culture.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The results of this investigation show that PCR has advantages over culture when it comes to detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of wrist anatomy and pathology.
A particular diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and scapholunary ligamentous apparatus are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Over the last decade, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA has been increasingly used in forensic medicine practice, in archeology, and in evolutionary and population genetic studies.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with particular reference to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological investigations is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work with the aim of extracting mitochondrial DNA from ground-stored teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which were clarified using mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as personal observations.
Microperimetric studies following surgical extraction of chorioidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting loss of pigment epithelial tissue.
The surgical costs must be weighed against the possible functional results of both types of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its high soft tissue contrast, is the imaging method of choice for visualizing the intra-articular structures and surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows the direct visualization of labrum lesions by distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences enable assessment in the decisive cranioventral sections.
With MRA, labrum lesions can be divided into different, clinically relevant stages.
In addition, it is also possible to visualize accompanying lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress oedema).
In a study conducted by us with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
There have been no complications so far with the more than 100 arthrographies performed so far.
Based on these experiences, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
In this review, we present the technology and results of the MRA method we used.
It was found that the varicose wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the venous wall below a venous valve that was still intact.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was due to the venous wall and here in particular to the components of the extracellular matrix.
When looking at the mechanical tests and immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose reshaping of the vein cannot be confirmed; it is much more likely that there is a change in the venous wall and thus also valve insufficiency.
Artery injuries as a direct result of trauma usually result in bleeding or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be absent in the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries.
Hypothenar hammer syndrome represents occlusion of the distal ulnar artery as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually insidious and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven treatment recommendations.
Diagnosing ulnar artery occlusion as a result of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
This study will examine medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthetic induction and anesthetic maintenance with propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anesthetic medications or techniques.
This article shows how to best utilize the advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined oral surgery-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw through a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and the placement of endosseous implants is only rarely included in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept for 23 patients was defined on the basis of the production of a rapid prototyping medical model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with particular attention to anterior tooth aesthetics.
For 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results achieved.
Profile forecasting with video imaging is a useful decision-making tool when planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, direction of insertion of endosseous implants and type of supraconstruction.
Large-nodular multicenter juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, whose unusual clinical and histological aspects did not initially permit diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change from the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells and the lack of evidence of specific cell organelles were able to confirm the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations, among others, are available on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with deficient and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as investigations that, due to the short duration of the study and the low number of patients, do not allow any scientifically justified statement.
A medically justifiable treatment recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with a sufficient benefit-risk assessment, according to the current state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the dextra hepatic artery in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic epigastric symptoms, there had been repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to determine when the patient was in condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising treatment option.
Investigations on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insult have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are recognized quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 hours after the onset of the initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
This number can be increased through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The current standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of heart rhythm disorders, blood pressure management, and treatment of hyperglycaemia and hyperthermia.
As part of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the effectiveness of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with oral methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate (= percentage of patients who remained in the examination program over the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and length of stay were defined as target parameters.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a tendency in the retention rate (p=0.06) in favour of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine treated group (n=20) tended to be higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
With regard to the additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, there was no significant difference between the two during the course of treatment.
Methadone proved to be the more successful substance in terms of length of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and how significant are clinical parameters and locoregional treatment failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of hematogenous metastases?
Between 1.8.1990 and 1.10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined with regard to clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumour growth, T category, lymph node involvement and eating habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In accordance with the treatment concept, 25/139 patients underwent a radical neck dissection after radiotherapy was completed.
10/139 patients were later treated with an “opération de rattrappage”.
The median follow-up was 24 months (range 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%), the condition could be controlled locoregionarily.
The tumour was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumour, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, sex, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly influenced by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival of patients with locoregional treatment failure was 17 months.
At this point, 81% of locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/62) of locoregionally uncontrolled patients, compared with only 4/77 (5%) of locoregionally healed patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau after 24 months.
Locoregional tumour control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a decisive indicator of the probability of the development of distant metastases.
Failure of therapy has its cause in the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension is achieved in volume recording and spatial and time resolution in CT.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current treatment of viper bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of edema, sometimes threatening;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive procedures on the distal extensor of the knee joint.
The MPT fixator was fitted in mounting form A for 44 patients and in mounting form B for 23 patients.
4 patients had a deep infection, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the patellar ligament for caudal debris fractures and 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the patellar ligament for lacerations and tears at the lower patellar pole or suture adaptation of the patellar ligament in the case of intraligamentary rupture, for whom no other restorations apart from extensor surgery were followed took place on the knee joint.
In 2 patients, the result was considered normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients had a strength deficit of 10-20% in the extensor muscles on the operated leg compared to the opposite side.
In summary, the EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven effective in continuity-restoring procedures on the distal extensor of the knee joint and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial bruising with wire or synthetic ligament material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic options and the development of diagnostic algorithms now make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies whose benefits have been investigated in clinical trials.
Based on the case report of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous haemorrhagic vesicles recur acutely at the beginning of the light-rich season until adulthood, which heal scarcely.
As part of a field test, we gained experience using the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central imaging method in X-ray diagnostics in oral and maxillofacial surgery is panoramic imaging.
The reduction of dose requirements has also become possible due to further developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or imaging plates.
Diagnostic deficiencies in conventional imaging methods make imaging by means of computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging unavoidable for numerous clinical issues in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows changes in the cortex to be imaged due to the shortening of measurement times.
For certain issues, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures enable image-assisted functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is used today on an inpatient and outpatient basis, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are particularly important for patients whose physical awareness is reduced, their emotionality is limited or, due to character resistance, are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with brief examples, and reference is made to other methods.
The active factors mentioned include the connection of affects to the vegetative and voluntary nervous systems and the close connection of psychological and physical processes, which exists especially at the beginning of life, which is associated with the particular form of interaction experienced and has psychobiological effects.
In further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire symbolic significance that is important for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy, in particular to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in an area of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and previous experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic work leaves individuals plenty of leeway to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to implement a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects are described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic work on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
In their education and training, psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships as to therapeutic relationships with patients.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced heart failure is becoming increasingly important within the patient population with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6 to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice for drug-refractory heart failure.
However, the growing disparity between supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients that can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical treatment approaches have developed.
Conventional drug therapy was improved through the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive beta blockers.
The surgical treatment of advanced heart failure has been expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assistance hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricle reduction plasty, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These treatment options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplants.
The success of treatment depends decisively on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores on the basis of national and international patient registers.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Bochum Orthopaedic University Hospital, the number of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapy procedures over the period of one year.
In contrast, there were 122 manual therapy procedures performed on the cervical spine, thoracic spine and lumbar spine by the respective ward doctors with completed further training.
While TLA focused on the main predisposition site of the respective disease (pseudoradicular cervical spine and lumbar spine syndromes), manual therapy focused primarily on side findings on other levels of the spine in patients with the above diagnoses or with post-discotomy syndrome.
The migration of a preserved mandibular tooth from the site of its attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of migration of a retained lower premolar into the muscular process, documented over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending lower jaw branch into the muscular appendage took place after root growth had ended, after the patient was 20 years of age.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there any concrete causes for such extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer and cases treatable by radical prostatovesiculectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis and the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no standardized method for processing the preparations internationally, it is difficult to compare different scientific studies.
The precisely defined, rational serving of the preparations proposed by us is intended to solve these problems and improve the interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood of demands on documentation, performance recording, efficiency and quality control requires the use of IT tools in clinics.
The Orthopaedic Clinic of Justus Liebig University, Gießen has been using a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (medXS) since 1992, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific requirements of the clinically active physician have been taken into account in particular.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, OR planning (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), OR documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
By simultaneously integrating the web server into medXS, content and functions can be accessed simultaneously from the intranet or Internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet-ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by unspecific neurological symptoms and, in particular, facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukodermia (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered relatively typical and usually trend-setting.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
Therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prevention of sudden cardiac death.
Individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM have manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication in accordance with standard treatment guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to test a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that records alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patellar replacement as part of total knee prosthetics is generally still very controversial.
In this context, we need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of an unreplaced patella in a prosthetic environment than just in comparison with a prosthetic patella.
The fact that we have only been performing patellar replacements in special cases for almost 5 years has provided us with a set of patients that can be used to study this issue.
On the basis of 30 knees with total prosthetic treatment, documented with a 2-year follow-up, we carried out a targeted survey of patellar shift and tilt, initially focused on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar plain bearing, and compared the results with the range of motion achieved after 2 years and persistent pain symptoms.
An adaptation of the bony patellar silhouette to the prosthetic slippage was observed regularly, with compaction of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous placeholder layer;
On the basis of their clinical follow-up, 7 patients were assigned to a “residual problem group” because they had residual symptoms (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were there cases with postoperative shift over 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt over 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, also significantly different from the problem-free group, complaints were also correlated with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility correlated with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap course (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After an axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient too became symptom-free and easily mobile again, without any surgical intervention having been performed on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
It is therefore reasonable to conclude that recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm seems justified:
In addition to common surgical steps, which have a beneficial effect on the course of the kneecap, implantation may require, for example, a high quadriceps displacement or a medially displaced refixation of the detached tuberosity.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, as the patella that has not been prosthetically treated has an astonishing adaptability to the prosthetic slide due to remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, we had to accept more late problems in the included cases with severe preoperative misalignment, for which we had not replaced due to good peroperative bone quality, even with normalized patellar progression.
Whether there is an extended indication for patellar replacement in such cases remains an open question.
The VDR quality assurance program and the DGrH quality assurance publications provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
By introducing comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinic structures.
So far, the focus has been on measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes.
Rehabilitation-specific training series were conducted to increase employee satisfaction and qualification.
New future-oriented perspectives were developed together with other partners.
The aim of the operation is to prevent or eliminate compression on the nerve structures.
The present work provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasms.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that there are increased respiratory chain defects in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as in the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unknown.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasias are pathogenetically different from oncocytic neoplasms.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas occur primarily in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
Which molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for this is still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like skin lesions in a patient with long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin lesions of this patient are also due to a lack of zinc in the body.
The substitution of zinc results in an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic dermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people are compared with regard to their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The skin patients examined differ significantly from healthy skin patients in the sense of impaired sex life.
The exchange of tenderness is highly significantly reduced in both sexes, and the ability to orgasm is highly significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatics feel more affected compared to patients with atopic dermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with atopic dermatitis have never been asked about their sex life by their treating physician so far.
Despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor for skin and venereal diseases should, however, be a competent interlocutor for questions relating to the skin disease and its consequences for sex life.
Even today, the conventional X-ray image must be regarded as a basic examination when it comes to clinical questions about inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential not only includes bony inflammatory destructions, but also allows their current activity to be assessed.
Furthermore, the X-ray image can indicate a clinical relapse via the collateral phenomena and directly and indirectly represent the inflammatory increase in volume of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computer tomography, in particular through the detailed presentation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR - offers highly specific information on some specific issues, particularly on the stem skeleton and individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis and partly also for surgical planning.
This applies, among others, to the sacal iliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
The treatment of open lower leg fractures II degree and III degree with concomitant soft tissue damage today includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the undrilled medullary nail to primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this takes place under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
It was only through the associated successes that it was possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the hitherto high rate of invalizing amputations and infections.
While initially only individual case observations, there were increasing signs that these patients had frequent soft tissue problems in the lower leg, ranging from recurrent tendency to swell up to leg ulcers.
On the basis of a clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy volunteers, it was shown that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
There are degrees of severity of this damage ranging from a simple tendency to swelling up to leg ulcers, which become more important in their clinical relevance as the time distance from the accident event increases.
Strict compliance with surgical guidelines in primary care is required to prevent further damage, including iatrogenic damage; postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Objective of surgery Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and stepwise distraction.
Restoring the shape and function of the limb.
Mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins which have a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in the antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent results also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumour biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present work provides an overview of gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including own findings.
Through the establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany, it has been possible in recent years to establish a network of outpatient and inpatient services with established general practitioners, internal and orthopedic specialist rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists as well as acute and rehabilitation clinics working there.
In the long term, rheumatological control centers can contribute to further improving cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatism patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatism patients quantitatively and qualitatively in the sense of a comprehensive rheumatological quality management.
Despite the increasing incidence of medicolegal problems, knowledge about the nature and frequency of treatment errors following thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg medical associations revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints rose exponentially over the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert commissions found medical malpractice.
The complaint concerned the surgeon in 95%, the anesthetist in 2%, both disciplines in 3% and an ENT doctor once.
Of the symptoms, 90% related to complications following routine thyroid surgery.
Complications typical of surgery, such as recurrent palesis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postoperative bleeding (3%) and late recurrence (1%), together accounted for 63% of allegations of treatment errors, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left lumps (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of allegations but 70% of treatment errors.
There were deficiencies in information in only 11% of the medical malpractice found.
The diagnosis of treatment error was particularly common when another operation was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001) or when a complication was followed by an error in post-treatment (p < 0.001).
The “Environment and Health” area is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and the resulting high need for communication.
This is compounded by the fact that considerable problems sometimes arise when it comes to obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this area has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications include bilateral kidney tumours, kidney tumours in patients with functional and anatomical individual kidneys and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis after tumour nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Through surgical strategy improvements — such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery, patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumours can also be saved by over 95% from nephrectomy followed by dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving kidney tumour surgery in imperative indications, more and more centres recommend extending parenchym-sparing kidney tumour surgery to selected patients with contralaterally healthy kidneys (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral kidney cancer of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears low.
The prognosis following the manifestation of local recurrence is poor in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been described most frequently in small cell lung cancer.
We report on 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or a carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regimen is not only effective but, in particular, has few secondary effects.
The following is a report about a patient who observed pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the healed areas of psoriasis as part of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard treatment for urolithiasis.
Various lithotriptors have been developed using largely the same technical principles.
The current discussion includes the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence, which further make appropriate metaphylaxis useful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in addition to other forms of therapy are still pending.
Following treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), acute corneal calcifications were observed in isolated cases.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted us to carry out the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy following in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and an active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case report, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with exacerbed tuberculosis following IVF pregnancy.
various options are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, which were described for the first time in 1901 by Karl Landsteiner, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, displayed on a polyacrylamide gel using silver staining.
The following allele frequencies were determined in a southwestern German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 of 280 persons examined (3.57%), the test method chosen here, which only takes nucleotide positions 261 and 703 into account, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae generally does not require arthroscopic clarification.
The following case report should prove that exceptions must apply.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a soccer game.
Arthroscopically, it was a firm, nodule-shaped hematoma converted into connective tissue, which was easily removed with one fetch:
During the soccer game, there was obviously bleeding in due to a contusion or patellar subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after arthroscopy, and muscle atrophy quickly receded.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions over the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented which suggest a longer-term effect (longer than one year).
Recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By differentiating the short-term effects of inflammation inhibition from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop independently of each other to a certain extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms presented elsewhere at this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and -chains of the 1, 3 and 4 integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show marked intra- and inter-individual variation on the sperm surface as well as different localizations.
The “nested” polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether AM is functionally relevant for interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or whether they represent only “biological redundancy” or only the very last binding protection (final insurance).
Sperm AM labeling was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of -adrenergic receptors and has a diverse spectrum of activity.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, uniform levels during the day and an increase and nightly peak between 2.00 and 4.00 in the evening.
In addition, independent of a receptor system, melatonin, due to its strong lipophilic properties, has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and act as a radical scavenger in the extracellular and intracellular space.
The affinity for the severely damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin for some skin diseases, such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There are some findings on the penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further investigations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics for chronic inflammation lies, on the one hand, in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which, when the focus is unclear, allow a focus of inflammation to be located, since the option of full-body scintigraphy and SPECT technology is available, and on the other hand, in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which, for example, make it possible to detect leukocytic infiltration.
Both procedural approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which result in inflammation scintigraphy if the findings are unclear.
Background and question.
Cryosurgery has been established as a method for treating capillary infant hemangioma for a long time.
Surprisingly, however, there has been a lack of detailed studies to date that prove their effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The patient's prognosis depends both on primary, mechanical brain damage and on the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to intracranial space requirements due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated TBI and after multiple trauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory “system reaction” (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multiple organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but can be fatal when combined and cumulated.
Hypermetabolic states following TBI are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the entire organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of TBI on the rest of the organism should be compared with the influence of multiple injuries sustained by a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, with shock-related perfusion disorders causing prognosis-imitating hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized “whole body inflammation response” influences blood coagulation, metabolism, and fracture healing.
The knowledge of trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the entire organism, as well as the influence of currently used therapeutic measures, is still insufficient and requires further clarification.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary procedures that do not directly serve to support life and result in additional stress on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This work attempts to summarize important aspects in this area.
For a better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and, more recently, human Kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making tools.
Children with facial cleft formation have an increased risk of another malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects fluctuates significantly.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 accomplices and examined for conspicuous personality traits.
They were also asked via questionnaire about their personal reasons for the abortion.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin was described as erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin, a dominantly hereditary dermatosis with partial circinary erythema, particularly in families from the Oudtshoorn district of South Africa.
The seasonal binding to the winter half of the year and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and initial immunohistological findings from a 4-year-old female patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
No ancestors from the endemic area could be identified.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed with regard to their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the works reviewed reveal significant deficiencies.
This study should examine whether visual acuity decreases as a function of presentation time and whether normal people and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged in driving angle assessment by these regulations.
Sudeck syndrome affects a limb following microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory reaction to an injury or operation of a limb.
His theory found no support, as most doctors believe that Sudeck syndrome is caused by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We carried out various clinical and experimental investigations and also recorded the effects of antiphlogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this work, methods for using rapid multislice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
In addition to the radiological examination methods commonly used in dentistry, computed tomography enables superimposition-free visualization of the upper and lower jaw.
In addition to the already established use of CT for malignancies, its use has proven effective for other issues.
If the examination is performed with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retained teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the saved teeth can be assessed so that early treatment is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the retained tooth can be delimited, orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, horizontal and vertical bone loss must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space requirements can be measured with CT.
Prior to an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the location of the nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
The symptoms of SE are described using case studies.
The main symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to a coma.
Cranial computed tomography is also usually normal; generalized cerebral edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change whose extent correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated immune reactions of the organism to bacterial products and bacteremia itself are major etiological factors.
Due to a disorder in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors, such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycaemia, shock and ischemia, as well as liver and kidney failure, may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since adequate treatment of sepsis at an early stage is of decisive prognostic importance, SE is of particular diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy, endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis.
Movies tell stories.
Scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts are particularly exciting.
Medical ethics conflicts arise not only in medical series or depictions of illnesses, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance films, gangsters and crime films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and are at the same time seismographs of the social relevance of medical ethics topics.
In the film, however, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the action.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical ethics case discussion and is a helpful addition to teaching analytical and communication skills.
The reduction in the rate of restenosis compared to conventional PTCA has resulted in stent implantation becoming the most common initial intervention.
For this reason, in-stent restenosis—especially its long-lasting form—represents an important clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on emergency services.
In addition to providing initial care for the injured person, the initial treatment of the amputate in the event of amputation injuries is often decisive for the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of laryngeal imaging is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
As a result, the general rule is to carry out imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnosis.
The topographical-anatomical conditions of the skeleton, internal structures and the surrounding area of the larynx will be presented synoptically.
Transpedicular stabilization using a screw-ring band system eliminated the instability while maintaining segmental functionality.
In recent years, new insights have been gained about post-traumatic changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological-intensive care management, this has led to the development of drugs that are intended to reduce the incidence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
In the context of this work, the recent findings of pathophysiological changes following TBI and the basic pharmacological intervention options are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in different stages of experimental and clinical testing.
Background and question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease progression represent a significant problem for oncological dermatologists.
The aim of the present work was to examine the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the disease progression of exhausted melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had taken minocycline prophylactically for lung silicosis for over 3 years before symptomless blackish spots appeared on the face.
The other patient had grey-black patches on both lower legs after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis.
A trial treatment with a ruby laser resulted in a reduction of the pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed using the case studies.
Objective of surgery Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological facial reconstructions in recent years.
A key factor is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
As part of this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve after partial tumour surgery and reconstruction with the vasculated thoracic longus nerve was investigated.
Pressure and pain could be felt after just 3 months, touch and vibration for at least 5 months and thermal stimuli at least 7 months postoperatively.
The vascular-pedunculated thoracic nerve is therefore a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in tumour patients.
The use of acetaminophen (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) is the most proven cause of intentional overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, but only a relatively small number of serious complications occur in a large number of overdoses.
Severe liver toxicity should be expected in any patient who exceeds standard doses and has a minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets for a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
In addition, any patient for whom the severity or timing of the overdose is unknown should receive a full course of N-acetylcysteine, regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function worsens.
If signs of severe hepatotoxicity begin, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal treatment or immediate referral in case of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has significantly improved the fate of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be achieved through closer cooperation between referring hospitals and specialist facilities for liver diseases.
Background and question.
Itching is a side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases that are difficult to treat.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
When applied topically, after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers and thus selectively suppresses itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological clinical picture that is both diagnostically and therapeutically problematic.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for treatment-refractory testalgia.
After adequate environmental diagnosis, 12 patients were treated surgically by spermatic cord neurolysis:
The cremastericus muscle is severed using bipolar diathermy, and the adventitia of the testicular artery is removed over a distance of 2-3 cm under microsurgical conditions.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations for patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is exact, so that precise environmental diagnosis is essential to rule out a specific cause of the testalgia.
In neurosurgery, too, there is a trend towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid major trepanations, to minimize preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves, and thus to keep the risk of neurological and mental disorders as low as possible.
The hospital stay and incapacity for work can thus often be reduced.
Neuroendoscopy is an essential “minimally invasive” procedure.
With its preformed cavities, brain chambers and subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of endoscopes.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is occlusive hydrocephalus.
However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumours and smaller intraventricular space requirements can also be effectively treated endoscopically using a small borehole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, such as cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome and adjuvantly for microsurgical operations.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral body metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes (i.e. diffusion barriers), a low ADC is expected, and in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is expected.
A 53-year-old man had a melanotic lung tumor that had completely blocked the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
Laser therapy was followed by a cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung.
On the basis of histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumour was classified as malignant melanoma.
There was no evidence in the anamnesis that a skin, mucous membrane or eye lesion had been removed earlier.
Even the targeted examinations of the skin and eye revealed no evidence of a primary tumour located there.
The neoplasm is therefore to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed so far.
After a relatively short observation period of approximately 10 months, the patient is tumor-free.
So far, there is no experience with twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore examined twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnosis.
With ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacological stress protocols, as currently used in echocardiography, can be performed.
Corneal HLA-DR antigens are lost during organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this is a downregulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has developed into a routine diagnostic technique that is used primarily in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry because it is less informative.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically correct technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, primarily the S phase and the proliferation index, and in the second line also ploidy, represent prognostic and important factors for treatment planning.
A precise knowledge of the method and the possibilities of error is essential for interpreting the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be regarded as unclear at the present time.
Other developments include the introduction of multi-parametric investigations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of measurement values.
Injection therapy plays an important role in cervical syndromes.
This article deals with general requirements on the one hand and the various practical injection procedures on the other.
Summary The coverage of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear, although the question of reimbursement by private health insurance should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical prevention (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as legal bases for reimbursement.
PEP is health care within the meaning of Section 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as there are no corresponding recommendations from the federal committees.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon in order to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to assume costs may be considered in accordance with the principles of the legal status of the so-called new examination and treatment methods.
In themselves, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be specified in terms of indication and method of application and exempted from ambiguities.
If a doctor does not use PEP when indicated in accordance with the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a medical error, as there are still too many uncertainties from a scientific point of view.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplant immunology.
Organ culture storage results in loss of HLA-DR positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The previous work investigates the importance of an extended corneal storage period for the success of perforating keratoplasty.
Based on personal experience with 3-dimensional echocardiography, attempts were made to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanal studies in 3D and to examine their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis was described as a dose-related side effect in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after an intensive treatment of 105 days with 72 days of ventilation, experienced heterotopic ossifications of 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant for severe pulmonary hypertension.
By resecting the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints, it was possible to restore mobility.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur in particular post-traumatic, after spinal cord injuries, after TBI, during intoxication and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is not yet known, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause new bone formation.
The diagnosis is made using imaging techniques.
Prophylactically, drug treatment using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiotherapy, or a combination of both procedures can be carried out.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), for whom we used the argon laser for local treatment for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that could not be affected or only slightly affected by established treatment strategies.
After using the argon laser, there was complete and permanent healing in the area of the treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
In the context of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of treatment-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Overall, complications of viral hepatitis are the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
The prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analog lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Reinfection for hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
An effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
In the case of hepatitis C, the prognosis for the transplant is less favorable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable with other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study and existing literature.
The treatment of these tumours consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception is rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative requirements.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific myocardium or the working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentry tachycardia of varying incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the tachycardia mechanism and the role of the accessory path in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the conduction system and the detection of other parasspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coinciding heart diseases should be examined by echocardiography before the intervention and, if necessary, at the beginning of the procedure with contrast imaging.
In 300 patients with variants of pre-excitation syndrome, their own catheter ablation results are presented.
In order to achieve a better quality recording of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over the years, it is necessary to standardize the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses.
Since 1.1.1997, the Heidelberg Orthopaedic University Hospital Foundation has maintained a complete consensus register of all early complications of all inpatients.
The complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program in accordance with a standardized nomenclature and the information is checked, corrected, supplemented and classified by the clinic's quality management department.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard for recording and evaluating complications in orthopedics with the aim of building consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the area of the acras at an advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, this is likely to be due to an obligatory impairment of dermoepidermal coherence in the course of treatment, which becomes clinically manifest as a result of mechanical stress in the form of bulging blisters.
Acrobullous photodermatosis should be differentiated from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of too much UVA irradiation or too high psoral concentrations.
The clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture are presented on the basis of two cases.
In addition to autoptically confirmed findings of fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no reliable clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the ISFC working groups and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological characteristics, which have been divided into main and secondary criteria.
On the basis of the subsequent examination of a group of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the criteria developed will be verified.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in terms of main criteria were detected in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricle.
The typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium was histologically discovered in all patients.
T inversions in precordial derivations as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS broadening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found as the main criteria in 8 patients (33%) and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%).
A late potential analysis using signaling ECG was available in only 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of secondary criteria.
Left thigh block-like ventricular tachycardia, which were classified as secondary criteria, could be detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died of progressive right ventricular failure without proven arrhythmias.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion was collected in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a reliable histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without the addition of histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favourable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more likely to be possible.
Clear data show that severe hypoglycaemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the impact of acute hyperglycaemia in cerebral ischemia is viewed controversial.
The conflicting results of the clinical and experimental studies can be explained in part if different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood sugar levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycaemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia when there is inadequate collateral care.
Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, an acute increase in blood sugar can protect nerve tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation exists in the area of the penumbra and with good collateral care.
We therefore hypothesize that both the negative and positive effects of acute hyperglycaemia depend on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgery diagnosis, according to which 50 of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies underwent resective epilepsy surgery.
The localization of findings from non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computer tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or had seizures only very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal, in particular temporal, epilepsies, non-invasive EEG results are sufficient in pre-surgical diagnosis and the risk of invasive EEG tests can thus be avoided.
Case history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented himself in an external clinic with a new onset of tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiography initially raised the suspicion of an intracardiac space requirement, which should be further clarified using transesophageal echocardiography.
The ECG showed absolute tachyarrhythmia with frequencies of up to 146/min; intermittently, a sinus rhythm was also documented.
In the X-ray examination of the thorax, this was also confirmed as a large space requirement in projection onto the posterior mediastinum, projecting laterally beyond the right mediastinal margin.
The cyst was surgically removed using an anterolateral thoracotomy due to the expelling growth of the cyst, which caused atrial rhythm disorders and to safely rule out malignant degeneration.
Since then, the patient has been in a sinus rhythm and complains only of isolated “dropouts”, most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primarily seemingly harmless atrial rhythm disorders may also be due to rare causes such as thoracic, extra or even intracardiac space requirements, which require specific treatment.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cranial nerve paresis can have a variety of causes.
A dissection of the internal carotid artery is a rare cause of paresis of one or multiple cranial nerves.
Early detection of a carotid dissection, even in the case of atypical symptoms, is important, as anticoagulatory therapy started in good time can prevent a stroke as a result of a dissection-related embolism.
We report on 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder syndrome) and the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden cranial nerve failure must also be reminiscent of a carotid dissection.
The misalignment of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary abnormalities, often remains asymptomatic until old age, but can also become clinically manifest even in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical treatment of a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as on the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis was made by chance as part of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis was made by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of transplanting the coronary artery misalignment without using extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was without complications.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods to treat fractures close to the joints offers, among other things, the opportunity to achieve good functional results through minor, surgically caused soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least exercise stability, even in comparison with standard procedures.
In addition to minor surgical soft tissue trauma, arthroscopy provides a particular advantage over conventional methods for the exact intraoperative assessment of joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of accompanying intra-articular injuries.
Of a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures, 34 patients were able to perform arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis in our clinic between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up examination of a total of 17 patients showed good results overall according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In the case of selected patients, we consider arthroscopically supported minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable even for AO classification 41 C1-3 fractures.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who, after moderate traumatic brain injury, developed bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy without other neurological deficits, which completely resolved clinically within 3 months.
Since computer tomography did not detect a cranial base fracture in the area of the posterior cranial fossa, we discuss a bilateral strain of the hypoglossal nerve as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency describes a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of everyday life.
The backlog spreads from the major leading veins via the smallest venules to the microcirculation area and finally has an effect on tissue metabolism.
Typical clinical characteristics, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement method, are the best basis for classification principles.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the bottom of arteriovenous short circuits.
In the area of the lower extremities, skin changes usually occur unilaterally, which are reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and rarely hypertrophy of the affected limb.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerating nodules with a tendency to bleeding and infection.
The causal therapy consists in the removal of arteriovenous shunts.
Surgical intervention is rarely possible due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
It reports on the successful embolization treatment, which has been performed a total of 8 times so far, in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.
Until now, the exact diagnosis of very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin has relied on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on a frozen section (CD1a) in addition to clinic and histology on an H&E incision.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-based markers now enable these diseases to be processed (even retrospectively) and precisely classified on formalin-fixed material.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and with the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classic cells of Langerhanszell histiocytosis (LZH) can be separated from other histiocytic cell systems.
In the case of so-called non-Langerhanszell histiocytoses (non-LZH), there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their responses with the corresponding paraffin-bound immunohistological markers can vary significantly within the various clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown using Xanthoma disseminatum as an example) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown on juvenile xanthogranuloma) appear to have diagnostic significance with regard to the differentiation from Langerhans cell histiocytoses.
Both markers show a positive response pattern with the epithelioid cells typical of the disease process.
In the following, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after administration of allopurinol for several weeks and after re-exposure to this drug.
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4n0m0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had suffered from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner ulcers for 10 years.
To date, 7 case reports of non-schistosomia-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in world literature.
Although the development of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of an IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma appears to lie in chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting conservative treatment options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urination were performed.
“NoTox Histological Fixative” is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde to fix tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autoptically obtained organ samples were used to test NoTox.
Conventional histological stains and accepted immunohistological stains, in particular for tumour diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these tests carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoTox do not differ from formalin-fixed tissue samples in terms of reproducibility of conventional stains or visualization of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoTox has proven to be a useful substitute for formalin.
Dose variables such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the “multiple scan average dose” (MSAD) and the free-in-air axis dose are usually used to describe the patient's radiation exposure in computed tomography.
The CTDI and MSAD, which can be derived from this, are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses that are relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient, according to the radiosensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose, which allows an assessment of the risk.
The specification of an upper guideline value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirements of the examination region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities can be used to characterize and differentiate different examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
Following a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been included in this definition.
As a result, a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpes viruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of an inflammatory heart muscle disease and a dilatation of the ventricles.
It seems useful to assign an independent place to shame as a general human emotion in contrast to guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the “self-maintaining” function of shame should also be considered.
The occurrence of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of worth, even if it should not currently be noticeable in the patient.
The signaling character of shame is discussed and the question of whether symptoms of shame have a medical value are considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, which is very inhomogeneous both in terms of crisis understanding and treatment methods and in terms of professional responsibility.
In detail, general treatment models for psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder and event-specific concepts, and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without an inflammatory response and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune systems in its pathogenesis have been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show an increase in inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
Increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy.
The aims of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.
In an in vivo study and on specially fixed corpses - in accordance with the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992 - it was investigated in which position relative to the balloon the fascia transversalis is located and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In TEP, the fascia can only be used laterally to the artery to reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment to fix foreign material (net).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scaly crusts resulted in the diagnosis of scabies norvegica;
An underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
It is assumed that treatment of eczema, which lasted for months in the sense of immunosuppression, has led to an exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are being evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions with regard to O2 transport and in particular effective O2 delivery to tissue has been proven in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approx. 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
A certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions being evaluated today.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated by humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions group, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and acute care for injured people.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is based strictly on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, for which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapeutic component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive care.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotraumas of the lungs, particular attention should be paid to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
The clinical use of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication, and the skills and abilities to safely manage complications that arise with intensive care or emergency medical measures.
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygenation, with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive care character, should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthetist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this work, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for acoustically accessible tumors due to its good depth focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for “online” monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The option of non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging temperature measurement can be an important instrument for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy for human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
The long-term effects of preterm delivery on ocular and ENT medical status should be demonstrated in a group of extremely small premature babies.
Since 1993, the Orthopaedic University Hospital Homburg/Saar has been using an IT system for operating and outpatient documentation and to support general clinic organization.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures in accordance with GSG requirements.
Since its introduction, the system has recorded data from 31,500 patients and documented 8,500 operations.
If the software is sufficiently flexible, both the requirements of the medical sector and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through further, clinic-wide networking, Homburg University Hospital also offers the opportunity to exchange data across departments and to use scientific networks and the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and post-operative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to test whether dorzolamide influences accommodation or pupil response.
Reference is also made to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with current compensation practices.
In this study in sheep, it should be clarified whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and unsulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation with the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether there is a temporal allocation and whether the results suggest the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or marker of arthrosis.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals:
The knee joints on the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects are used as controls (n = 54).
The radiological scores between the groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significant (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, HA was significantly higher in the ME and MV groups.
CS results in a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) both when measured 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial separation.
Clinical consequences:
The HA level makes it possible — at least experimentally — to a certain extent to describe the degree of osteoarthritis.
The concentration increases with a longer postoperative interval and with an increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome may present with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures in childhood.
Therapy with blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In the event of treatment failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockage may be considered as an option.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
Additions and use of an epidiascope are described, which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ discs in general and special pathology courses and saves expensive video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older people and are of far-reaching importance.
These problems are here related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego ideal in old age.
Pathological escalations of the aging process, which are often present in older patients, are shown in three aspects.
Narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are then described and options and goals in the treatment of older patients are discussed.
The results of the Mitchel Muscle Energy Technique treatment for spinal problems are presented.
Joint mobility disorders in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed using the Muscle Energy Technique.
The therapy is highly successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to impulse chirotherapeutic techniques.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhoea and symptoms of sicca.
The clinical picture, serological findings and histologies of the duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy reveal the diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different symptoms has not yet been described.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet results in a rapid improvement of clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological symptoms.
In industrialized countries, it is medical conditions rather than lack of food that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common among the elderly population and occurs in 5-12% of those living independently, in 30-61% of hospitalized and in 40-85% of elderly people living in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A doctor's increased awareness of nutritional problems and a prompt risk assessment are essential prerequisites to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The reflected-light microscopy comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
digitiform radial extensions, blue-gray reticular patterns, opaque alabaster-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/gray background, pseudopodia-like edge zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
However, specific reflected-light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
A diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumour is therefore based on a number of individual characteristics suspected of malignancy that occur in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy methods in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Commonly used vectorial transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer from anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Initial clinical usability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) was transferred are a significant step forward on the road to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experiences with uni- and bidirectional distractors both in intra- and extraoral administration in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic disorders.
These included 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 baby with Nager syndrome and 1 rare case of a midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm being achieved.
Older people interested in continuing education are increasingly recognizing the wide range of opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and institutions for the elderly are called upon to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media literacy and to design interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
On the basis of experiences from the “Senior Information Mobile” information campaign, opportunities are described to provide people over 50 with access to the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European “Learning in Later Life” (LiLL) network and other projects, it will also be shown how spatially and temporally decoupled “research-based learning” of older adults could become the engine of a “new learning culture” in the sense of virtual working groups and networks, which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or continuing education institution or cannot participate in local offers for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods in recent years.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of the simultaneous recording of morphological and functional parameters through a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Because of its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the advancement of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that offers an insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of MR heart diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic method that offers the complete clarification of heart diseases in one examination, both as an initial examination and as a follow-up.
As a result of the rapidly advancing development, existing restrictions, especially in the field of MR coronary angiography, will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development in documentation and IT at Heidelberg Orthopaedic University Hospital is given.
Since its foundation in 1967, there are 4 development phases:
initial medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, implementation of information systems with the option of medical controlling and thus management of performance.
Planning and implementation were carried out taking into account the framework plans and concepts of the university hospitals of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of an extracorporeal chest compressions.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteritis following PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyema and formation of an infected spurium aneurysm.
The cause must be assumed to be contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with type II unilateral cleft foot with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current status of the controversy surrounding the indication for patella replacement.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical fields is described, as well as the design features of the various types of implants and special features of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar back surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for back surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for replacing the patellar back surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and relaxation of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear so far.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is commonly observed after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensiogenic drugs cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (FK 506), or prednisolone.
To date, hardly any studies have been available on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term “occult fracture” describes the absence of visible fracture signs in conventional radiography performed for initial diagnosis when the fracture is nonetheless present.
The diagnosis can only be made during the course of the diagnosis or through further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations performed for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method that allows both the early diagnosis of the “occult fracture” and the diagnosis of any accompanying chondral and ligamentous injuries.
In the present study, we report on 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, who could be diagnosed with MRI if the X-ray findings were negative.
Athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon described early on.
The histological evidence of cholesterol crystals in small transcurrent arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical picture and the diagnosis, which could only be confirmed invasively or post-mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe aortic atherosclerosis.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical procedures or catheterization of the aorta.
Anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of aortic atherosclerosis with pedunculated and mobile thrombus originating from circumscribed plaques.
Embolic episodes were prevented and a regression of the thrombus was observed.
A 62-year-old patient with pronounced valgus deformity and extensor inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar femoral fracture is reported, which was osteosynthetically treated with a dynamic condylar screw 2 years ago.
Here, the indication was made for a varying and extensive corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis using a retrograde femoral nail.
Within the first postoperative week, the patient was able to fully load her right lower limb with axle adjustment.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method for achieving good and stress-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective surgery.
Lacrimal duct surgery on 296 children from 1987 to 1992 at the University Eye Hospital Münster was examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspect, but they themselves are not evidence of carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (nuclear size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison with pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must always be critically assessed and can, at best, confirm a cancer diagnosis or (if basal cells are positive) safely exclude it.
The present review summarizes the various diagnostic criteria and evaluates their value for routine diagnostics.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 14-day 20 mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. was compared with a monthly dose of 50 mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100 mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55 IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters just one day after the first dose.
Despite continued administration of the test substance, there was an increase in inflammation parameters.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55 IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient is reported who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
Healthy newborns are also entitled to optimal care so that any postnatal adaptation disorder is detected in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods, such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has significantly simplified the situation for all responsible people.
Background and question.
In view of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aqua jogging is a technique that has been used for years in sports and rehabilitation, which involves jogging - similar movements in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sport, aqua jogging is used as regeneration training and as “low-impact alternative training” in strength endurance and endurance.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and post-operative period for musculoskeletal disorders, and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular surgery or prosthetic.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery is the only causal treatment that has its place in selected patients.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
Contrary to initial short-term successes, the long-term results had to be adjusted from over 80% to around 53-55%.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success (less than 40% on average).
Penile prosthetic surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term implant survival rates and patient satisfaction of 89%.
However, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this treatment option to the last part of the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications can occur, such as cylinder defects and perforations, with 5-year implant survival rates of between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbus transplants, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our 3-year experience with the homologous central limbokeratoplasty method developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly reduces nocturia frequency, while urination frequency remained unchanged during the day in a controlled study.
Heparin also reduced nocturia frequency in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, and this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of websites with radiological information have been created and are now available online, creating competition with commercial offers.
Based on initial experiences, the task today is to critically assess the opportunities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
In the following, from a psychiatric and forensic perspective, we report on 2 cases in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID and accused themselves of killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations for caring for affected parents are shared.
The review of 110 children admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu within a period of 7 years with Burkitt lymphoma showed that male patients were overweight compared to female patients (1.9:
1) and a maximum age of 5 years.
The areas affected first by the tumour were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that an interrelationship between malaria and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition could play a role in the etiology of the tumour.
The most important drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this medication with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in initiating disease regression, but is better than the individual agent in preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has been a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Zwickau Surgery provided important impetus for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization, and for surgical teaching in words and pictures.
After a brief review of the literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and treatment of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the background of early fears of abandonment, there is a renewed threat of abandonment as part of the development tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which has so far served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, can trigger pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis following use of a dithranol preparation of the magistral formula, which is mistakenly 50 times too highly concentrated, in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance, as it can be successfully treated and in some cases also cured as a secondary form of hypertension through interventional radiological or vascular surgery measures.
The incidence and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications following LASIK should be investigated.
An andrological patient is reported whose initial examination revealed high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicle size, which was significantly below the normal range, indicated marked testicular parenchyma damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline and subsequent 3-month recovery period with combination treatment with vitamins C and E as well as the trace element zinc, there was a significant improvement in spermogram.
After a further 2 months, intrauterine insemination enabled a pregnancy to be achieved with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At this point, the patient only had mild teratozoospermia.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of central serous chorioretinopathy during systemic therapy with corticosteroids will be described.
In addition to ultrasonography, an X-ray of the pelvic overview is still used today for the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in young children.
The toddler's legs should be kept in a central position.
Side rotations and increased pelvic inclination should be avoided.
A look back at 150 years, including 50 years of personal experience in the development of septorhinoplasty, which most recently reversed to the 19th century in the “open approach” with opening the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practised again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
A sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest x-ray is the first priority.
Profound knowledge of the normal chest image and the possible physiological peripartum changes is a prerequisite for interpreting the neonatal chest image.
Infantile pathologies:
A wide variety of congenital and acquired changes faced by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in radiodiagnosis of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or may affect the quality of life in the rest of his life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the most important pathologies that radiologists may face in their daily routine.
The primary tumors were breast carcinomas (n=34), leiomyosarcomas (n=20), pancreatic carcinomas (n=16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n=13), melanomas (n=9), gastric carcinomas (n=9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (n=6 each), and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumours (including synchronous primary tumours) were present in 69 out of 140 (49%) cases, with an extrahepatic tumour present in 51% (n = 61) of the 120 initial resections.
Of the 120 initial resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
The overall median survival was 20 months after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After a second resection (n=14), there was a median survival of 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumours at the time of initial liver resection, the median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The available results show that resection of even non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases certainly promises prognostic benefits.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrence may even benefit from second or third resections of the liver.
In some cases, impressive long-term developments were observed, even when the initial situation was assessed rather unfavorably.
The indication for surgical therapy should therefore be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained baffled as to the unpersonal act, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communican artery.
For the assessment of guilt, this course in connection with the reported behavioral problems shortly before the crime therefore makes it possible to consider the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven effective, among other things, for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) displaced into the vitreous body.
Because of the high specific weight of PFCL, the IOL is suspended and can be transferred to the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be refixed, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
What type of contact PFCL enters into with the IOL is unclear.
Since PFCL is likely to be biotoxic if left intraocular for a longer period of time, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
A rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma has been reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year symptom-free postoperative interval.
In the course of further investigations, no clinically detectable metastases were found.
Taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is still very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas annulare) of the two systems.
In the end, pancreas divisum and pancreas annulare can only be secured by showing the pancreatic duct.
Congenital diseases include genetic defects that usually also affect other organ systems and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually at the forefront of the symptoms.
Both the developmental abnormalities of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes of the organ, which can be detected using modern imaging methods.
Books often contain more than just the material written by the author.
On the basis of the panel work by Bärensprung and Hebra, it is shown that, at second glance, they also reveal some other facts relevant to medical history.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-onset congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel breast and a lethal outcome in acute gastric volvulus.
The validity of ultrasonography for bacterial coxitis was tested.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes' disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were examined sonographically.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the hip head surface and the periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard sectional planes of DEGUM.
An intra-articular space requirement (synovitis, effusion) can be recorded sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule removal was detected sonographically in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and in the early stages of Perthes' disease.
Since joint capsule distension does not differ significantly between the individual diseases, it is not possible to differentiate these diseases on the basis of the sonogram when capsule distension is present without bony changes.
Bacterial coxitis can therefore not be reliably differentiated from coxitides of other etiologies by sonography;
Capsular distension is considered an unspecific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, an immediate diagnostic puncture may be required under ultrasound control.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to capsular distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes' disease in the condensation and fragmentation stages can be differentiated both from bacterial coxitis and from coxitides of other etiologies.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in combination with clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since tumour cells were unusually highly dedifferentiated for gliomatosis cerebri in both cases, the diagnosis was hampered by atypical findings such as contrast medium uptake on MRI and clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure.
The clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various test designs, such as cohort study, case-control study and randomized clinical trial, are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and shown that they are the only way to make statements about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by using complex statistical methods, but that, in this sense, good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
The possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has been assessed differently so far.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost ignored in investigations.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerotic symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenoses were treated with transluminal angioplasty and primary Palmaz stent implantation.
In one case, a thrombendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with profound aplasty was performed simultaneously, and in another case an angioplasty with stent implanting of the common iliac artery.
Technical and clinical success was achieved in all cases.
There was no occlusion or clinical restenosis over a median observation period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a less invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
In short, it is reported about a patient who underwent several years of sterility treatment and became pregnant even though she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus occur ubiquitously as pathogens.
In the past, Aspergillus flavus was considered to be rather apathetic for humans.
The case of a 72-year-old patient is described in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in tracheal secretions after aortocoronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit.
The serological test procedures performed, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
Is “monoclonal antibody” correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) Latex particles covered with monoclonal antibodies were multiple times negative.
A postmortem aspergillus test using a newer method, antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of a systemic infection in clinical and radiographic findings.
The patient died before using antimycotic therapy; the autopsy showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs due to Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection using enzyme immunoassay can make it easier to diagnose systemic aspergillosis.
By correctly assessing the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, an intravenous antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even if Aspergillus flavus is once culturally detected in the trachea.
Epidemiological data show a decline in appendicitis and appendectomy incidences in industrialized countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforations is highest in extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - particularly among young women - and the high perforation rate among young children and elderly people show the low diagnostic reliability.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow any clear conclusions to be drawn about the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After refractive procedures on the cornea and after cataract surgery, ocular image defects (aberrations) may occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why maximum retinal vision is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
Capturing these image errors under clinical conditions would be a first important step towards documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
To date, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been carried out experimentally for both methods.
Ecke and Hofmann came to the conclusion that comparable stability could be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that this was to be preferred as a prophylaxis of ankylosing because mobility in the symphysis is maintained.
Symphyseal stabilizations using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire pull straps and PDS bandings were comparatively tested by simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions.
The symphyseal preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55,500 load changes (steps taken during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire strapping nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, and these methods allowed symphyseal mobility that extended beyond physiological limits even immediately after the start of the test.
In the further course of the test, the instability increased due to incision of the cerclages and bandings into the bone or fracture of the wire cerclages in general to the point of complete failure.
In the case of DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
When the screws had a primary tendency to over-rotate, plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic load.
With primarily stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable over 55,500 load changes with a load corresponding to an average of half the body weight.
For clinical use, it can be deduced from these results that neither bridging pull straps with wire cerclages nor PDS banding stabilize the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If the DC plate or the reconstruction plate can primarily achieve reliable stabilization of the ruptured symphysis by firmly anchoring the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person can be mobilized with an “open-book injury” with partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted successfully for years.
Due to the distribution of light to several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or stray light effects caused by capsular fibrosis may result in vision impairment at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumour was initially misjudged as primary anaplastic thyroid cancer.
It was only as part of an anemia assessment carried out 17 months later that a 7-cm diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected by duodenopancreatectomy.
The reassessment of primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died a further 6 months later from an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumour as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastases.
Drug therapy for erectile dysfunction includes oral and local administration of drugs.
At present, the only approved oral substance with proven effectiveness is yohimbine, a centrally effective alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral medications with a central point of attack include trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine being significantly better effective than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous administration are available for local administration.
As a substance used, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely replaced other drugs at the present time.
Several promising substances with a wide variety of effects and different dosage forms are currently being developed as therapeutic agents for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, working with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient's state of consciousness and contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached through words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies grouped under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are generally between 20 and 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients stabilize the disease for a limited period of time, in some cases lasting even years.
Most of these are the results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are generally not to be expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient groups.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotreated patients compared to untreated or chemotherapy patients.
A survival advantage is guaranteed for patients with objective remissions.
It is currently not possible to define a standard treatment.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of current treatment protocols and their high costs must be taken into account.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates and the survival benefit for immunotreated patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential part of the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
It should generally be used as part of clinical trials.
In 501 test subjects of both sexes, i.e. 262 men (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old each) and 239 women (half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old each), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
The calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the epiploic appendix of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as a random finding during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy due to endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old patient.
It had the same histology as similar ovarian tumours and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the epiploic appendices and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal irrigation fluid.
These findings are likely due to occult peritoneal endosalpingioses.
The histogenesis, histology and localizations of Müller-type primary peritoneal neoplasms are discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon transplant, it was initially hoped that this procedure would provide benefits in terms of stability, post-operative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of endoscopic technology has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopically and 14 open-operated patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems, ligamentary stability (KT-1000), duration of surgery and proprioception were measured using the angle reproduction test.
The energy dose of spiral computed tomography and the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube capacity recommended by the manufacturer of the computer tomograph for a dental CT was gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the optical path) with 187.5 mAs and 1 mm slices (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement accuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approximately 76% had no effect on length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of an enteroviral myocardial infection in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnosis.
The introduction of histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with the suspected clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, allows a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) in accordance with the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response, which can be detected using histological and especially immunohistological techniques.
It was only by combining histological, immunohistological and molecular biological techniques that it was possible to carry out a subgroup analysis with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative), bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis can be distinguished, which, in contrast to the others, preferentially manifest on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis that we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case reports.
In terms of differential diagnosis, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered despite its rare occurrence, since - after bioptic diagnosis - it is a domain of conservative, medicamental therapy.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication following cataract surgery.
Despite modern medical and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumours is based on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Based on a literature analysis, the role of total treatment duration and dose intensity in optimizing chemotherapy protocols is examined using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses as well as, above all, well-designed clinical trials can enable progress in the chemotherapy treatment of tumour diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules and thus alters cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
In this work, the in vitro and in vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was preferred for in-vivo use.
The paclitaxel effect in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall was demonstrated by staining the cytoskeleton and electron-optically.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel resulted in significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and expansion of vessel diameter compared to balloon-dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contraction force was shown after paclitaxel administration.
In addition to age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplamsaal and basement membranes of RPE cells (“basal laminar deposits”), various forms of manifestation of early and late AMD such as druze, chorioidal neovascularizations and pigmentary epithelial elevations show a splitting of the Bruch membrane between the basement membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesive apparatus could be detected.
Recent studies have shown that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis occur as a result of impaired spinal column growth.
Determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the lesion site and the type of visual affection in order to enable early surgical treatment with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
Suitable animal models that occur in nature are also missing for the majority of common dermatoses.
The transgenic technology, which was founded in the 1980s, closes this gap.
It was initially an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented specific dermatological basic research.
It made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses on a murine model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
As a result of targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities with psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
Transgenic technology also makes it possible to induce cutaneous tumours.
The existence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for artificial heart valve wearers are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues, such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses and complaints inside the knee, can be examined better with MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect artificial heart valve wearers in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias through electrical currents, and indirectly through distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in artificial heart valve wearers appears to be insufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on invisible examinations, or transferred responsibility to the doctor who performs the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prosthesis.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and requirements for MRI safety standards for artificial heart valve wearers is provided.
In an experimental study, 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg underwent intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml gas.
In the argon group (n=5), two animals died after administration of 20 and 30 ml of bolus, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), neither did any of the animals die nor was resuscitation required.
Low-soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granuloma annulare with known diabetic metabolism.
In addition, there was renal failure, which allowed us to refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoral full-body baths using the film method, which, after 30 treatments, led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin condition on the extremities.
There were no side effects.
Balneophotochemotherapy can therapeutically influence not only epidermal but also dermal-localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (KKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
It was only a few years ago that the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, was isolated.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Other organ manifestations occur less frequently.
We report on a 47-year-old patient who developed a reactive spondyarthritis with synovitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the medium and large joints and inflammatory lumbar pain after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were temporary and responded well to NSAIDs.
So far, only a few cases of joint involvement have been described in the context of a KKK.
However, since the infection of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, it could be a more common cause of joint problems than previously assumed.
The diagnosis of KKK has been made easier in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
As a result of continuous treatment optimization in recent years, the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved significantly.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a variety of possible long-term complications, of which the attending physician must be aware.
Often long-lasting symptoms of fatigue, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the quality of life of the mostly young patients is permanently impaired.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful treatment is a significant problem.
Based on attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thought, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in situations relevant to commitment (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the aim was to operationalize these patterns appropriately in the sense of their original definition, i.e. as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles “secure,” “avoidant,” and “ambivalent” were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the start of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on factor analysis results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the start of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as attachment styles:
“safe,” two variants of “insecury-ambivalent” (“closed” and “clinging”) and two variants of “unsafety-avoidant” (“locked” and “ready to cooperate”).
The discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions similar to those of Collins and Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, fluctuating dizziness and the simultaneous radiological evidence of a contrast-absorbing space requirement of the internal auditory canal confirm the existence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case report shows a case of major lymphoma in the area of the cerebellar bridge angle, which resulted in peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial palsy that occurs within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgias radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings, as in the case described by us, must challenge, despite the presence of leading symptoms, to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification.
The manifestation of solitary lymphoma in the cerebellar bridge angle is considered a rarity.
Balneotherapy and physiotherapy are other treatment options available to gynecologists in practice, clinic and rehabilitation as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a naturopathic procedure.
Depending on the indications, balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures are primarily used as supplementary measures.
Only in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they particularly suitable as primary measures to reduce pain and positively influence tissue.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture is present and a subsequent sensitivity test is carried out.
It takes seven to eight weeks before a negative crop result is reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps using new methods, such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The alarming epidemiological situation of tuberculosis infection risk worldwide leaves no doubt that it is necessary to develop methods that allow mycobacteria to be detected, differentiated and tested for their sensitivity to antibiotics in the shortest possible time with high sensitivity and specificity.
As part of a prospective randomized study, a non-joint bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for treatment of the distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with treatment by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
There is a long tradition of collecting donated milk for women in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who themselves have children born prematurely is preferred for very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years, Germany has created a large number of day care centers (TsN) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBsN) as complementary day care centers.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the extensive lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on how they work.
In the present work, 100 visitors from TsN and kbSN in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptoms and visitors' perspectives were collected.
Almost all visitors had already received inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied significantly, with an average of moderate severity.
Two thirds of the visitors were berentated, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
Visitors cited contact with other people and the organization of the day as positive aspects of the facilities.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
Visitors to TSn were younger on average and had higher scores on the BPRS subscale anergy.
In addition, visitors to the two institutions hardly differed in the characteristics examined.
The results suggest that both institutions actually care for chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration, for whose care they are also designed.
For these patients, they partly compensate for deficits in the social network.
The limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional brain examinations were only possible using nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast medium applications and special post-processing methods made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
With T1 and T2*-weighted contrast-assisted imaging sequences, information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and blood-brain barrier permeability can be collected using special models, some of which are derived from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, the macrovasculature, with temporal resolution, using MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic investigations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be recorded multidimensionally and metabolic processes can be observed as they progress.
The advantages of MRI are its low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional presentation of the data and the ability to repeat the examination at will in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumour diagnostics, functional MR techniques provide important additional information for treatment identification, treatment planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial investigations have shown that the methods are able to sensitively record pathophysiological changes in dementias and psychoses.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to make health protection as high a priority as possible in the countries of the European region, also in the face of constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors that impair health should be combated internationally through concrete measures or, better yet, prevented as a preventive measure.
An indispensable prerequisite is agreement on international standards in the area of environment and health as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It must be ensured that governments and the respective population develop a common awareness of the important environmental health problem areas.
In order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a “WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health” (WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health) in the summer of 1997 with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn at the Robert Koch Institute.
A 30-year-old patient is reported who had a right-sided amaurosis fugax with a concomitant frontobasal fracture following a fall event.
CT and MR angiography proved to be the cause of occlusion of the ophthalmic artery as a result of dissection of the internal carotid artery with increasing thrombosis.
There were no further neurological deficits, as adequate blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured via the circulus arteriosus cerebri.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
The suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification using appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, an asymptomatic patient was echocardiographically suspected of an aortic dissection.
Because of the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used, in addition to other cross-sectional imaging methods, to diagnose evidence of an aneurysmal enlargement of the thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was admitted to hospital due to acute thoracic pain, increasing dyspnoea and with a picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
In further evaluation using echocardiography, the cause was a ruptured sinus valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary sail with a left-right shunt into the right atrium by non-invasive means.
The cardiac surgery was performed without complications while maintaining the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the sections of the right heart were normal; no shunt was detectable in the color Doppler anymore.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be the result of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
Echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography made it possible to make a precise diagnosis in a non-invasive way.
The hallmarks of Nager syndrome are mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
Lower jaw hypoplasia can lead to airway obstructions due to the tongue resting against the back wall of the throat, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with Nager syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnoea.
After the soft tissues had been pre-stretched by an extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of just 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic results are good.
Airway obstruction and dyspnoea were no longer observed after treatment was discontinued.
Successful thrombendarterectomies (TEA) of the internal carotid artery result in improved perfusion in the current area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is advice between two or more doctors on the diagnostic-therapeutic approach in the treatment of a specific case of illness using modern telematics.
Practical use will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice has largely been defined; it is currently unclear whether this independent medical service will be adequately rewarded.
The aim of the study is to examine the influence of these lenses on vision.
Nowadays, there is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris can lead to a reversible effluvium in loco.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct result of psoriasis is disputed.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old patient who has suffered from progressive effluvium in psoriatic foci on capillitium for years.
Histologically impressive strand-like fibrosis instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and hallmarks of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic connection between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important insofar as consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormones (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treating these fibromyalgia patients with recombined growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms, including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely to be caused by an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
It is hypothesized that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent periods of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in -adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin, resulting in reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research points to the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-harming behavior (SVV).
However, the efficiency of classic neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, the serotonin 2A dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone effectively reduced SVV even in the longer term.
The aim of the present study was to create an osteoporosis model using ovariectomy.
Osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed before and after the ovariectomy using DXA.
There was a significant decrease in bone density after ovariectomy in both the upper and lower jaw.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic haemarthrosis of the knee joint were examined and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of bleeding were manifold:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from arrogated subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy yielded good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are caused almost exclusively by vipers (Vipera berus).
Viper injects venom from various enzymes and hemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Viper bites in children can have few symptoms, but can also cause severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their environment can be displayed over a large area.
This significantly improves the transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapist who is not present at the examination and the monitoring of a finding, e.g. of a tumour, under treatment.
For their part, viruses have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies means that more and more messages about epidemics and diseases are being received from all over the world in ever shorter periods of time.
This work uses four case studies to examine the factors that can influence an early or late diagnosis of dementia.
In all our cases, we have given the indication for surgery.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily sewn over and thoroughly rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the suture was additionally secured by fibrin adhesive or with omentum plasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Based on these own results and after evaluation of current literature, we believe that the following conclusions are justified:
If perforation is secured in the early stages, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Seam closure of the perforation site should also be attempted if diagnosis is delayed with advanced mediastinitis.
Additional security is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without concomitant reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidneys, Wilms' tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more often.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed-tissue tumors that only rarely contain larger amounts of adipose tissue.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumour in a horseshoe kidney, which could also have been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous proportion of internal calcifications according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in various cross-sectional imaging methods.
Both differential diagnostic considerations were correlated in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms' tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high mortality rate of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
A 58-year-old patient with a 6-month medical history, blood-purulent expectoration and significant body weight loss, who was assigned to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma, is reported.
It was only possible to diagnose thoracic actinomycosis through a diagnostic detour.
This was caused by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms receded rapidly and ultimately led to the patient's recovery.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of diagnosis for the differential diagnosis of thoracic space requirements, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumours as well as germ cell tumours.
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old female patient whose percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, adjustable “banding” of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The described technique therefore represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or is unsuccessful.
In 20 years, the diagnosis of mastitis was made in 3% of biopsies of benign diseases on the patient's own examination material.
While puerperal mastitis is now present in about 1% in relation to the birth rate, the various forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently being diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small proportion is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-shaped fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and if pathogen-related mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological tests should always be carried out on fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs primarily in patients with weakened immune systems or treated with antibiotics.
We report on 2 5 or 14-year-old boys with clostridium difficile-related colitis, without the above preconditions or a specific underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, increases the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of an appropriate protocol leads to an earlier start of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily screening of respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable tools that should be included in a weaning protocol.
As soon as the condition and ability of spontaneous respiration are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be promoted, as sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be extubated successfully after a spontaneous breathing attempt.
A gradual cessation of mechanical ventilation may be initiated in patients for whom spontaneous breathing attempts were unsuccessful.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation influences the rate and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate should improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and the surgical outcome in 30 patients with unilateral LKG columns.
Open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal grid photos and a lateral remote X-ray image.
Deviations of nose symmetry, nose width and nose wing attachment line from the ideal shape were determined.
The nose profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal and the angle between columella and Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate airflow.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined and the flow of the slit and non-slit sides were compared.
The tests were performed immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, there is a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nose wing inclination.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofacial angle and the low wing of the nose was not achieved.
As a result of the intervention, it was possible to increase the overall flow and to correct the quotient of the flows on the split side and the non-split side.
The examination methods used make it possible to objectify the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings and thus serve for quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents following manual spinal therapy from 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications associated with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Because of its excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice for the assessment of ankle disorders.
Conventional MRI can reliably represent normal and acutely injured ligaments.
In the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, however, there is often a lack of joint fluid, which is necessary for an exact delimitation of the injured ligaments.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases, as intra-articular KM application distends the joint space with improved differentiability of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the assessment of the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions, km flushing of the dissecate can be more easily visualized.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free joint bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
Although invasive, MR arthrography provides significant additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint and various ankle diseases.
After acute treatment, the therapeutic goal of resuscitation must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the condition before the onset of the emergency.
The present study examined the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated in a rural area due to an out-of-hospital cardiovascular arrest of cardiac origin.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of stem varicose veins of the V. saphena magna and/or parva type.
Ascension may result in migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the mouths of the trunk veins in the groin and popliteal fossa or via insufficiently perforated veins, which threatens the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I comprises varicophlebitis of the trunk veins without involvement of the mouths of the great saphenous and/or parva veins and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially into the deep veins via insufficiently perforated veins.
In these cases, varicosis is only surgically treated after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes crosectomy, extirpation of the trunk vein via separate incisions, exhairese of all varicose branches, and ligation of inadequate perforated vv.
In type III, thrombectomy via the V. saphena-magna and/or -parva orifice takes precedence over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral areas of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
Formalpathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on personal observations and a review of the literature, exogenous factors in the form of compulsive acts appear to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with central nervous system involvement.
Typical symptoms include irritability, restlessness, states of confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological abnormalities.
We report on a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute brain organ psychosyndrome with progressive loss of consciousness up to coma.
Initial cranial computed tomography showed discrete, general brain swelling, which receded regardless of clinical worsening.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography showed generalized increases in flow velocity (middle, anterior and posterior arteries on both sides and basilar artery).
The causal relationship between increases in flow rate and impaired consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was similar to the regression of the increases in flow rate.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous monitoring of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although replacement plastic is the gold standard for treating cruciate ligament injuries, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent option for adolescents.
We report a rare case of post-traumatic brachiocephalic trunk aneurysm.
This was preceded by blunt thoracic trauma as part of a traffic accident.
Computer tomography (CT) did not diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs following blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be required whenever possible to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia issued by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are therefore categorized in terms of their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes differ significantly from them.
This brief presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide clinicians with sound decision-making support for their own practical work with regard to many everyday, but by no means secondary problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma received prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgkgxmin over a creeping phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in inflammation parameters, lung function, in particular diffusion capacity and pronounced acral circulation disorder.
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is regarded as the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view.
Bone and ligamentary injuries in the proximal forearm area present the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions of the elbow joint, which are associated with chronic pain symptoms and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
There is little doubt today that, in the majority of cases, primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with precise reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for satisfactory results as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With an increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the proximal forearm, there has been a significant change in therapeutic principles in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work, taking into account the relevant literature.
Electrode complications can have fatal consequences for ICD patients.
Manipulations by the patient on subcutaneously located electrode sections that can be felt through the skin can result in damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode courses and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This medication is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was used successfully in patients with psoriasis back in the 1970s.
The present review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology now offers the opportunity to precisely analyze structures tomographically in individual steps.
Image planes that cannot be displayed using conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes also allow a vivid representation of stored structures.
With these different display options and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D ultrasonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paresthesias, the accidental infusion resulted in burning pain in the legs, combined with a loss of motor and sensory innervation up to the TH 11 segment. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as those described are generally based on errors, the occurrence of which, although not impossible, can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include the color coding of lines, filters and infusion solutions and the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The examination of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transversal dimension has been neglected in dental implantology so far.
With a view to a basic evaluation of the influence of ridge height and width, 95 toothless bony upper jaws from collections that were sawn, measured and classified in a standardized manner was first analyzed.
For 4 types of implants (minimum length of 10 mm), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and differentiated according to implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
In the clinical part of the study, a similar procedure was used for 24 consecutive implant patients with an edentulous upper jaw.
Implant placement on the cadaver jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but was actually expected in a further 4.5% if the maxillary height was sufficient.
Implant length reductions were also required in 6%.
There were dependencies, in particular, on the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered much more favourable conditions than posteriors.
In contrast, none of the 24 patients had implantability.
Primarily insufficient height was present in 22 cases; if the height was sufficient, an alveolar ridge that was too transversely too narrow appeared twice only during surgery.
The results allow the importance of vertical and transversal maxillo-alveolar ridge dimensions to be quantified.
This importance is primarily due to bone height, although reductions in implant length are often necessary even if the height is sufficient.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain both on the cadaver jaw (12% of incisions with expected implantability) and on the patient (8%), for which the sole measurement of height simulates incorrect conditions and a precisely planned surgical procedure may have to be aborted.
The complexity and cost of implantological rehabilitation and the consequences of incorrect preoperative planning therefore justify or even require fundamentally extended cross-section diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging method that can be used to study metabolic processes and not morphological changes.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, they can be detected using radioactively labelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven effective for various tumor entities.
In this study, PET was examined during lymph node staging of bladder cancer.
In 64 patients, pelvic PET was performed preoperatively after i.v. injection of fluoro-deoxy glucose (FDG), so that the PET findings could be compared with the histological findings of the surgical product after classic surgical lymph node staging.
During lymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
The PET results are therefore encouraging and appear to be better than the classic staging procedures, such as CT and MRI.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses of 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis were determined to reveal an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had total subnormal immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immunosubclass deficiencies.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic sinus infections persist despite conservative treatment, sinus surgery is indicated, which is gentle on the mucous membranes, but this alone cannot bring the desired results in this clinical picture.
An immune subclass deficiency is an indicator of an impaired immune system.
Transitions into severe immunodeficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk and on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
There was a significant decrease in lesions when treated with acitretin.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses — in particular the “blashkitis in adults” described for the first time in 1990 — are discussed.
The retention of potency and urinary continence after rectal resections has increased after nerve-sparing preparation and complete excision of the mesorectum have become widespread.
However, postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinary incontinence are between 25 and 67% in the literature.
Material and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were shown on 10 corpses and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic preparations.
Their position and possible sites of damage were presented and photodocumented during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with only slight inter-individual variability.
The inferior mesenteric P. forms a dense network of fibers around the trunk of the inferior mesenteric artery (AMI) over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectal wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The front surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillian fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated using the standard surgical approach.
1. The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly clarified in the literature.
2. High discontinuation of AMI inevitably results in damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close positional relationship between rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes sharp preparation under direct vision unavoidable.
4. Fascia and nerves can be used as lead structures during preparation.
5. Selective protection of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not possible using the standard surgical approach.
The early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is important for the prognosis and groundbreaking for treatment planning.
In a prospective study, 83 patients from 1993-1998 with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx and lip were panendoscoped as part of staging to test whether this method allows early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx.
The conclusion was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous secondary carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precancerous conditions could also be diagnosed using panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary cancers in a primary care system in the “head and neck area.”
Based on the good experience so far and the course without complications, this examination obviously poses no additional risk to patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging tumors in the head and neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's disease can cause significant problems, especially at the beginning of the disease, due to the high variability of the clinical picture.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's disease, whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of illness compared to other ill family members were unusual and therefore significantly responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of bringing the onset of the disease forward is well documented in the literature in the case of transmission of the mutant gene from the father.
The attention to the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed collection of the family history were groundbreaking in differential diagnosis.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focuses:
as climate therapy, as (balneo) phototherapy or in a psychosomtic setting.
Since certain patient groups benefit from this in different ways, indications for psychosomatic treatment are worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological origin or involving psychological involvement, when depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation are present.
In the event of problems in disease processing, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for in-patient psychosomatic treatment.
The importance of orthopedic devices such as bandages and orthotics for functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle joint will be shown below.
The mechanisms of action of orthotics described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influence on athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities are then explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes in Müller-type cemented polyethylene pans.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of shape changes in the polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion can be determined by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first few years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it settles down to values of around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Head displacement values that exceed 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to loosening the prosthesis.
In this study, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the socket marking wire for a total of 369 hip prostheses and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average life of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n=109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
With the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was only achieved in 71% (n=260) (running time 61.5 months).
The polyethylene — ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene — metal pairing.
For younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferred.
If patients who are unable to give consent are indicated to carry out electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), approval from the caregiver is required to carry out the treatment.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had assumed the justified risk of prolonged health damage and had affirmed the approval requirement.
However, subject to contraindications, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychoses.
The use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
Retrograde amnesia in particular occurs only very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the risks posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, a guardianship court approval requirement under the Care Act must be denied.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is caused, among other things, by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the European MH Group protocol represents the “gold standard” of phenotypic diagnosis for MH predisposition due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a strong link between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene was detected in an individual from a large family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the agreement with IVCT were of interest.
The ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system disorders in children are relatively uniform sonographically:
Initially, lymph node and organ enlargement, as well as disturbance of normal echo texture, are usually found in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
Essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed ultrasonographically on the parenchymatous organs:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the “bulcky type.”
On ultrasound, therapeutic success can be seen in the normalization of lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organ echogenicity and the regression of tumor-related or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic information is derived from the topographical distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, to some extent, on the basis of echogenicity and the circulatory conditions that can be analysed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
Background and question.
In transient acantholytic dermatosis described for the first time by Grover in 1970, clinically there are usually itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles primarily on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically, acantholysis is typical.
Although the etiology is still unclear today, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provoking factors.
