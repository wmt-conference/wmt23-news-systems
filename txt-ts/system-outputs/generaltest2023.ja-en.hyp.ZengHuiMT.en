FUJI Develops a system to prevent accidents left behind Experiments with in-house vehicles | Chubu Keizai Shimbun Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Shizuoka's economic information.
Fuji ( headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars, such as "left behind" systems to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat room.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with shuttle vehicles at our own facilities.
Protecting the safety of children in the midst of tragic accidents caused by abandonment.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with two pick-up and drop-off vehicles of "teracoyaTHANK, " an English conversation after-school for children operated by the company in Chiryu City.
A motion sensor that detects the movement of people based on the temperature difference between people and their surroundings is installed in three places on the ceiling of the vehicle.
With the vehicle engine turned off and the door closed, if a person's movement is detected after a certain period of time has passed, a warning notification will be sent automatically if the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed.
By linking information with engine and door status, false positives are prevented as much as possible by preventing false positives.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, it is displayed in the chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as missing them.
Demonstration experiments will continue until around the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, manager of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out that "during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system became apparent." i
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions, " he said.
The development of the system to prevent leaving behind buses has been triggered by a series of accidents involving shuttle buses left behind across the country.
An employee with a young child suggested something that could be done to protect the safety of the child, and suggested that there could be anything to do with it to protect the safety of the child.
Through the FA ( factory automation) related business, we have decided to develop it to make use of the know-how such as IoT ( Internet of Things) and information management using sensors.
FUJI's anti-left-behind system sells for its ease.
The sensor can be installed by simply pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to pick-up vehicles, it aims to lower the hurdles to introduction and popularize it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens, but also consider commercialization.
[Editorial] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, originally scheduled for FY2023, has been postponed, and it is beginning to affect town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station is still not indicated, and urban planning, including surrounding development, is at a standstill, including surrounding development.
It is expected that the formulation of the plan will take a long time, and publication is required as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned in Obama City is the only new station west of Tsuruga, which is the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency indicated that the rough location of the station would be a radius of about 2.5 kilometers, mainly from JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the route were scheduled for the winter of 2010 for the purpose of finalizing the station and route.
In Obama City, projects related to the Shinkansen, which opened in Tsuruga and is expected to open in Obama after that, will be in full swing in FY2021, with a view to the Shinkansen opening in the future.
In the initial budget for FY22, the number of projects will be further increased, and the town development will be promoted in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not been shown even now.
The city is considering land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station, and has set a budget of 3 million yen for this year as a project to formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
Urban planning centered on the new station "takes time to build consensus among citizens" ( city official) .
There are indications of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station in Echizen City, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together the overall concept.
There are concerns that the longer the announcement continues to be delayed, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, which will affect the development of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there was uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, citizens' groups in Kyoto City along the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the extension plan to be withdrawn.
In Ishikawa Prefectural political circles, due to postponement of the start of construction, there have been a number of moves to return to the drawing board of the settled route, such as calls for reconsideration of the Yonehara route, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is monolithic.
Obama citizens are relatively calm about the postponement of the start of construction, but there are concerns that the location of the new station and the timing of its opening remain unclear will affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his activities to request the country to open the entire line as soon as possible, but the voices of the areas along the line calling for construction to start as soon as possible will be indispensable.
The indifference that "the Shinkansen will eventually pass ( west of Tsuruga) " does not move the country and neighboring prefectural governments.
I want enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.

A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at the "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch" at the "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch".
The adorable facial expressions are popular with family customers = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture.
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a widespread movement to introduce food serving robots that carry food to customers.
In addition to being useful for manpower saving in store operations and "contactless" customer service to prevent COVID-19 infection, the adorable facial expressions of the robot are popular with family customers.
Restaurant managers and others concerned say that it is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and that catering robots will become more popular.
"Gin, Gin, Genghis Khan♪"
A robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen smoothly drives around the restaurant with food on it while playing light music.
When I arrived at the table in the auditorium, I told the customer, "I brought you the food you ordered." i
In August 2022, "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
A robot waiting near the kitchen places food ordered by a customer and presses the table number on the screen, then autonomously drives to that table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI ( artificial intelligence) voice function, reacts when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat face on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which manages this store, has introduced catering robots at two stores, including this store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said, "The biggest reason for the introduction is labor shortage, " emphasizing that it is part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation ( DX) .
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21~22%, according to the company.
The robot also plays the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which has led to more efficient cleanup.
Rokuma Hoshiyama Fukui Branch, a grilled meat and hormone hot pot located in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August 2010, with a serving robot introduced in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Seongsan Shoten, which runs the company, said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, they don't come often, " he said, "I don't recruit employees and part-time workers. thought it was absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage.
The Fukui store operates by separating the zone where employees serve meals from the robot delivery range, etc.
The cost of leasing the robot is said to be about the same as the wage of one part-time worker.
In order to save manpower, stores are considering adopting an ordering system using robots and tablet terminals, and are also considering self-checkout in addition to robots.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, in December 2010, the effective ratio of job offers by job type was 6 "customer service" at restaurants and other establishments, including "customer service", according to the Fukui Labor Bureau. At 94 times, it is a job category with a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge of Net System ( Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for distributing robots, says, "Due in part to the Corona disaster, the labor shortage in restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, and there are many inquiries about introducing robots." i
President Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees in rural suburban stores in the future, and I think that catering robots will become popular."
Echizen Town makes an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who want it.
The facility published the "Ocean Handbook" last year, which covers the procedures necessary when a relative dies, a list of legacies, and family tree, etc., and it was said that it was triggered by many people who came to receive it for themselves.
Courses on how to write ending notes and organize your life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that "end-of-life" has become firmly established among the people of the prefecture.
Echizen-cho's ending note is 35 pages long.
Beginning with a review of his personal history in five chapters, he writes about his current health and financial situation, nursing care in the future, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section for what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
35 pages seems like a pain to write, but you don't have to fill in all the pages.
What do you most want to leave behind for your family, including those around you, to write about?
The key is to have a clear purpose.
Bookstores sell a wide variety of notebooks for different purposes, and it is said that you can easily start writing from where you can write.
Compared to job hunting, the word "end of life" was born in 2009, when it was born in 2009, when the word "end of life" was born.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
Many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", and it is said that more and more people are preparing for their own end times and end times.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world has not stopped yet.
Prices have risen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, funeral, nursing care, and grave management costs that could once be shared between siblings and relatives are not uncommon nowadays.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the dilemma is that the risk of dementia and the need for nursing care increases with age.
It should be borne in mind that the background to the establishment of the end of life rather than being a temporary one is the growing social unrest.
In any case, everyone wants to not put an undue burden on their partners and children.
It seems that "being yourself at the end" is also a popular keyword in ending notes, but you should not be too complacent, even if you are too complacent.
Instead of secretly writing down hopes and requests, I would like to consult with my family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.

On the other hand, one elementary school principal said, "If the government decides to do this, it will not be worn.sn't it possible to respond realistically if you exclude the chorus? " i
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease measures, such as allowing current students to participate in the ceremony, which they had refrained from doing, and resuming chorus singing by graduates.
In the prefecture, the ceremony is scheduled for early March for prefectural high schools and mid-March for public elementary and junior high schools.
Prefectural boards of education and municipal boards of education will wait for official notification from the Ministry of Education to determine how to respond.
In addition, there were cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's policy of not requiring students to wear masks in all school education activities since the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if they suddenly do not have a mask one day. After first deciding that "wearing is free", it is a natural flow for more and more children to gradually remove it." i

Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and high schools and universities will be held during FY22, and after implementing measures such as ventilation, graduates, faculty and staff, and participating students will not wear masks.

Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo, "The Breakwater of Life", a book self-published by the Nonprofit Corporation's "Inspirational Collection and Editorial Bureau" is "Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo."
Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo, The Breakwater of Life, I have self-published my 10th book under this title.
Newspapers across the country have picked up the story, and many readers have sent in their impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from suicide attempters about "social and structural" environmental problems regarding the causes of suicide in Japan, hoping that you will create a "comfortable society to live in" by sharing what we have heard directly from those who have attempted suicide.
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky shores of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a suicide spot, to prevent suicide.
This document summarizes the problems we have heard from 784 people ( as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister on the following seven items regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
( 1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
( 2) "Human rights violations" are piling up behind the suicides.
( 3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
( 4) Administrative agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly, treating citizens who live outside their jurisdiction.
( 5) Even if a person with mental disabilities such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
( 6) The "duty of care for safety" in high-risk areas for suicide has been forgotten and commercialism has taken over.
( 7) The part of the doctrine of a new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of telling the other party about future curses and threatening them with money and goods is extortion.
Religious groups that are committing criminal acts of "fraud and extortion" should be publicized and eliminated.
Therefore, in the comments received from those who have subscribed to this book, we have received comments such as "I was moved by the strong mentality of those who are engaged in this activity, " "This former police officer is a model among police officers, " and "He is a living bodhisattva who supports other people like his own relatives." Here is a part of the impression. Here is a part of the impression.
I looked at the photo in the newspaper article and said "What are you thinking about? " i i tears welled up in my eyes.
I have heard that suicides among people who have been cornered by the COVID-19 pandemic are increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I would like to see a society where people can live happily with the life they have been given.
I felt respect and gratitude for all the staff who devoted their hearts to those who were in such pain that they wanted to die and felt gratitude for them.
I think this activity is an overuse of both mind and body, but please take care of yourself and continue to call me in the future.
thanks pals :(
Kashiko.
I hope that you, the readers, will become gatekeepers of life in your community.

Kenji Shimada, who shoots capybaras almost every week and posts photos on social media, = February 1, "Hapijan", an indoor facility at Fukui City's Ashibayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture.
A man in the city takes pictures of capybaras at the indoor facility "Hapijan" at the Ashibayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, every week, and sends them out on Instagram.
The postings include a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment when you look at your teeth with your teeth peeking out of your big mouth, or the figure of you lying down and basking in your room.
With more than 10, 000 followers both in Japan and abroad, Happijan and capybara are helping to make many people aware of the charm of capybara.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posts traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram.
The man is Kenji Shimada, 38, a company employee living in the city.
In March 2021, we started disseminating information on social networking sites ( SNS) .
Capybaras are one of the world's largest rodents, and they swim well with webbed fish between their fingers.
Since its opening 18 years ago, Hapijan has raised three animals, one male and two females, and you can observe them up close and feed them.
Shimada-san learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
He said he was shocked to see a video of him relaxing in a hot spring and asked, "What is this animal? "
I was drawn to their charming expressions and gestures as if they were human.
After hearing that it will be bred in Happijan, we were looking forward to seeing it up close.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago when I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybaras, and the sight of the body shaking and cutting water like a drill does not miss a photo opportunity, such as the sight of the body shaking and cutting water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has reached about 830, so much so that he recalls, "I often took this many pictures."
It seems that the male Yamato-kun, who seems to have learned Mr. Shimada as he walks by, approaches him and makes a loud sound, "Yekyo-y-yyy."
Shimada's love for capybaras continues to deepen, saying, "I'm cute and I'm happy."
Through SNS, they enjoy monthly exchanges with capybara lovers from all over the country, such as showing each other their best shots and other people.
Shimada, who also visits zoos in neighboring prefectures to see capybaras, smiled and said, "I would like to continue shooting and disseminating information mainly at my home, Mt. Asuwa."

The building collapsed in an instant.
Together with neighboring Syria, more than 20, 000 people have been killed so far, and many are still left behind in the rubble of the country, known as a pro-Japanese country.

Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
I would like to pay attention to the situation until the situation settles down and reconstruction/restoration is completed.

Hayachine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held until the 12th at the Municipal Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City.
We have collected 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by our predecessors, and introduce the footprints of our ancestors who were involved in plant research on Mt. Hayachine.
Botanical research at Mt. Hayachine began with Karl Johann Maximovich ( 1827-91), a Russian botanical researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Naganosuke Sugawa ( 1842-1925), a native of Shiwa Town who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in Japan because of foreigners, asked Sugawa to collect them and continued research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa supported research even after Maximovich's return to Japan, leading to the publication of Himekozakura, Nanbutou Sousa, and Miyama Yamabukishouma, which are endemic to Mt. Hayachine.
After that, modern botanical taxonomist Tomitaro Makino ( 1862-1957) published "Nambattano", "Kobanotsumexa", and "Nambinu azuna" based on the collections of local researchers in 1903 ( Meiji 36), and "Kato Hakobe", which he discovered and named by climbing Mt. Hayachine himself in 05 ( the same year), based on the collections of local researchers in 1903 ( Meiji 36) .
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
Matsushima Sugimura ( 1874-1948), a botanical researcher and principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied a survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927 ( Showa 2), and Shichiro Tamagawa ( 1914-1988), a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum who was also involved in publishing "Plants of Hayachibo", and others.
Sohei Yoshida, a curatorial researcher at the center, said, "There are many research behind the name of each plant in Mt. Hayachine, and there is a connection between people and people." We can trace the connections between researchers spreading from rural areas to the whole country, " he says.
The exhibition consists of four chapters, the first chapter is about the belief and history of Mt. Hayaikemine, and the second chapter is based on research by German geologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann ( 1854-1927), who laid the foundation for Japanese geology, and the geological features of Mt. Hayaikemine based on the research of German geologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann ( 1854-1927) .

I'm looking for a gaming router that doesn't support Wi-Fi 6 and has a good reputation in WiFi.
Because it can't be constructed for various reasons, I know enough that it doesn't make much sense if it's Wi-Fi 6, so on top of that, I will have to pay attention to it if it's Wi-Fi 6 or not.
Please let me know if you know anything that looks good.
Please help with it.
It's more difficult now to find products that don't support Wi-Fi 6, so now it's harder to find products that don't support Wi-Fi 6 as well.
Since it is normally compatible with unsupported terminals, I think that Wi-Fi 6 products are good.

training.
Do you prefer muscle training before or after meals?
Training on an empty stomach ( empty stomach) can lead to muscle loss.
Nutrition ( mainly protein) after training helps muscles grow easier.
So, if you want to do it hard, you need both pre-training and post-training supplements.
But if I had to choose between before and after, I think it's better to eat and then train.

Please tell me about the economic effects of shortening working hours.
Many companies that have implemented reduced working hours have reported that due to reduced hours, employees have become more efficient in their own work, which has improved the company's performance.
Improved performance leads to higher wages and more holidays, which also increases consumption, which is also an economic effect.
Does it affect driving on snowy roads even if the air pressure of automobile studless tires is increased?
If I increase the air pressure, will it increase fuel efficiency a little?
Wouldn't it be useful if I had to make it quite high?
I think it will have better rolling resistance.
Studless tires are low-pressure tires, so if you set them to high pressure, snow will not bite them, they will burst more easily, etc.t doesn't have good things to do.

About Instagram.
I ( the general public) currently have about 10, 000 followers, but if people who don't know this see it, it's amazing whether you think it's amazing if you see this.
Or do you have nothing in mind?
What does it feel like.
I think it's amazing.
In the general population, it is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Problematic and frustrating.
I don't have time to exercise, so I bought it to rely on trendy pressurized innerwear and bought it to rely on popular pressurized innerwear.
Body type is H175mW 80kg I bought a L size.
It's quite difficult to wear at first, but once you get used to it, you'll be fine.
I used it for a few days, but now I am using another pressurized inner due to the problem.
The problem is 1.f the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve ( just the second arm) is too tight, causing a little congestion and itching.
2. The lower abdomen is loose and I stopped using it due to two problems.
It's quite tight when it comes to comfort, but there's no problem sleeping with it on.
Great deals for people who like you.
Even at 158cm and 50kg, S was fine.
But it didn't suit me, who has a large skeleton and is muscular, that's not good for me.
Since it is not made in a three-dimensional way, such as the buttocks, it is easy to create strange gaps and fall easily, so it is not easy to fall.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think it's good if you have a body shape like a stick.
In terms of thickness, I would like to say that it is safe to say that it is thin.
It was not like henna henna or the feeling of breaking, but even the perfect knee-high boots could be booted in and refreshed.
It’ s fantastic.
I don't want to show my upper body too much skin, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and came across it.
The top is fashionable with a one-point mark on the back of the knitting and hem.
I'm glad to choose between wearing a bikini underneath or shorts over it.
^) I just received it, and I just tried it on and it's not in the water, so I don't know how durable it is or what it feels like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought that this price was a bargain.
There was no wire in the bust, but when I touched it, it seemed that there was a properly hard core at the bottom of the pad.
But it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it follows my bust properly, so when I move, I think it looks good when I move, I think it looks good.
So, I've been, on and off, doing some model changes from no padding to having it.
( ^) I'm sorry for that.
^) I'm looking forward to getting into the water from now on.♪ Thank you very much.♪
45kg 156cm M size and a little bigger.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but the manufacturing method is solid, so I think it can be used for a long time because it can be used for a long time.
It had two rain visors to keep my face from getting wet.
There was no problem with strength, and I was able to use it safely even on a bicycle in a storm with peace of mind.
It was not torn after use and was not torn after use.
I carry it compactly in a compressed bag.
Really, it was more than I expected at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
I installed it on the CLA180 shooting brake in 2016.
If you read YOUtube or the manual, you can wear it even if you are an amateur.
Note that if you loosen the torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
After that, when you sandwich the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring and crimp it, if you do it with a tapered type such as radio pliers, the force will not be applied evenly as shown in the photo and the plastic will crack and you will not be able to install it as shown in the photo.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day and they are very supportive companies.
When I tried again, I crimped it with wide pliers as shown in the photo in the manual at once and it worked well.
When returning the last main unit to the car, it was a bit tricky to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installation, DVDs, TVs, and navigators can be seen while driving without any problems.
I think it is a very cost-effective product because it costs over 80, 000 yen if you order it at a dealer and over 40, 000 yen even at a specialty store, so I think it is a very cost-effective product.
Below the price, it is less than the price.
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated. First of all, the wat inside is poly, but there are fluffy parts and empty parts that seem to have been worn out in the cushion. Overall, there are few watts, so I tried to use it, but if you have to try a product that integrates the head and the pillow, I think there is something that matches or doesn't fit. thought that it wouldn't be a mistake to buy a separate pillow and the pillow this time at the time sale for 3600 yen, but I wanted to return it. reflected that the review with five stars should be more vigilant.
It's neither good nor bad.
Product arrives.
I was allowed to use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, but you can milk properly.
However, there are times when the sound is a little annoying and the response of the power button is poor.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but people who care about it may be worried about it.
It's not super quiet. 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful to use it.
In addition, I was worried that the part that connects the attached tube to the machine would enter the tube, but I pushed it in a😂 lightweight way, so I think it is easy to carry because it is lightweight.
Foaming requires tricks...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't foam at all with normal use.
( The shampoo I've used so far has been foaming without any problems even when I use it normally) So here's the solution I found ↓ 1 First, take less shampoo than usual in your hand and make it familiar to the entire hair.
( 2) Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo in your hand and blend in with your hair.
( This will finally bubble normally) Well, in short, it's washed twice. lol The capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo as much as possible the first time... am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself... am satisfied with the shampoo itself.
It's obvious that I bought such an expensive shampoo, but I obviously felt that my hair felt better.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that Quattrobotanico series was taken care of by facial cleansers...
Even though the capacity is small, the cost performance is so bad that you are forced to wash it twice.
In addition, in consideration of the scent that seems to be unpopular with everyone, I will give it a slightly strict 2 stars here.
Difficult to evaluate.
There are negatives and it is difficult to evaluate.
Just use the blade cleaner to clean the front side of the blade.
I think it matches well with a razor with the original blade precision.
On a positive note As intended, dirt on the blade such as sebum and soap scum can be removed.
If the dirt ( only on the front side) makes it less sharp, it will last a long time.
Negative. The life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
The coating on the cutting edge such as titanium coatings, ceramic coatings, etc. will peel off easily.
( If you use shaving 2-3 times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.) i
Be careful with razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge.
I wonder if it is cost-effective because it can be substituted with fall prevention rubber ( anti-vibration rubber) that can be put under furniture used as earthquake preparations.
*The life of the razor is increased by 20~30% that I use.
It is difficult to judge when a razor blade is discarded, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the cutting edge becomes rattling.
In that sense, I think that it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down due to dirt, so it can prevent sharpness down.
( It is a cleaner and has no sharpening effect.) Sometimes it feels like it's being developed, but it seems that the little rust it gets away and feels like it's been taken away. )
I got caught in a TV commercial...
I bought it after seeing a TV commercial showing that the face of a fairly elderly woman was drawn up just by applying it once.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a normal gel, and I wiped it off with pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will enter your skin unexpectedly.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and my skin felt like it was sucking on my hands.
The lift-up did not look like a TV.
I felt a sense of firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this one is not enough, and I have been using Moisture Surge 72 before this, so I've been using Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels just moisturizing.
I was hoping that it would also cover loose pores, but it does not cover them.
I think I will try using a bottle and see if it works, and if so, I may have repeats.
It must have been a lot of work to put them together, but...
It is a compilation of statements made by politicians over the past few years.
While reading it, I am somewhat convinced that that remark at that time was ah after all, or was it ah?
However, considering its value as a reading material, it is subtle whether the "fact-checking" as the authors call it is sufficient enough to make it necessary.
Honestly, it's not interesting to read and not interesting.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major flaw of this book was the "method", which is the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here will forever be facts.
I felt quite suspicious from the way they wrote the fragility of "fact-checking" ( let's call it falsifiable) .
When it comes to this level of awareness of "facts" among Japanese journalists today, I feel a little gloomy when it comes to this level.
Many people seem to recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the contents of this book.
If, like the reviewer, there are readers who are interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japanese media, I think this book will not suit you.
For those who do not improve their scores in mock exams.
At my school, political economy was printed out, and the class format was so boring that I felt like I was studying while I was doing it.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently in high 3 centers this year.
Since I bought it in March, I chose this as my study partner for an hour on the way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You have reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and asked past questions, I was an average of 40 and I was 70.
I was surprised even myself by the stones.
It grows as if I ate something strange.
I could feel from my skin that what I could get from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also the synergy of my own power and motivation to study.
Thank you so much for letting me meet you.
Crime prevention.
Eight years ago, I experienced two door-picking attempts, and I have taken crime prevention measures.
This time it is a replacement for a camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, I used infrared irradiation 30m type ( other companies) i
This product was written by another person, but the face recognition distance at night is about 5 meters.
I agree with you.
It just arrived and I haven't set it up yet, but I've compared the image quality of the camera and checked for defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera eight years ago ( of course) .
I used a 32-inch monitor with 4 split views, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem with it.
So far, there are no defects in the product.
If you are considering a level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be particularly dissatisfied with night shooting, but this price is the best if you are not satisfied with this price.
I use it for crime prevention, but I don't even ask for facial recognition.
Because if you are masked or masked, you won't know ( especially at night) .
Professional burglars ( thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems that high-performance cameras and recordings can be distinguished from high-performance cameras.
On the other hand, if you're not a professional, you're in trouble.
However, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so I recommend not relying only on cameras, but also using them in conjunction with various crime prevention products.
For example, white solar LED garden lights available at home centers for about 1, 500 yen ( the latest ones are very bright, with 6 units) .
Since it is solar, there is no need for electricity, but in winter, it does not turn on until morning, so there are also three 100V motion LED sensor lights with 100V motion LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters that could recognize human shadows.
In addition, if you think that the intimidation effect will fade due to the small size of the camera because of the daytime crime prevention, you need to cover it with some ingenuity.
I have a "24 hour security camera in operation" sticker.
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
The manufacturer's products are more effective than those sold at home centers.
The place to put it is a thief's entry route that can not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time ~ ~.
At the same time, I gave it a minus because the instruction manual for net settings is difficult to understand, so I thought it was a minus because the instruction manual for net settings is difficult to understand.
If there are any deficiencies after installation/setting, I will add them.
I sympathize so much that it becomes painful to read it.
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, your social situation may be a little better than hers, but the enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law still makes it far from equal, even though the Equal Employment Opportunity Law has been enacted, it still remains the same.
As I read on, the painful memories of surviving discrimination as a member of society came back to me, and it became suffocating.
It depicts the suffering of all women, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal society, trying to live not as women, but as human beings, but as women.
Isn't it time for at least women to stop the emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder in this society?
A drama that makes you think, "Men are the worst."
The story is about the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
Naturally, even as an adult, he continues to drag on the wounds.
The guys who come out are all the worst.
The husband of the protagonist, who seems to be mild-mannered and family-oriented, is also the lowest in a sense.
There are spoilers ↓ Even if you know that the protagonist's sister is being domesticated by her husband, you ignore it, and the sister-in-law finally got the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the protagonist's husband, who is a police officer, goes through with developments that are irritating to the men, etc. The development is frustrated by the men.
The protagonist's old mother, who pretends to be blurry, knows that her husband ( the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it ( officially, the real death is a drug overdose) .
In short, it seems that after the death of the rape father, his daughter was not allowed to receive counseling, so it is natural that the protagonist will go crazy, so it is natural that the protagonist will go crazy.
The protagonist's daughter wants to hear about her dead grandfather.
Do you really care that much about the old man who died so young?
It is a drama in a drama. like is that too much to ask i
A few years ago, it was reported that the morgues in Paris were full because many old people died in the summer after a heat wave hit France, and hospitals and facilities contacted their daughters and sons, but many French people said they could not take them in because they were on vacation.
These people are "dry" and "dry" i
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they were "dry" after all.
French products are completely different from the United States, and there are many vague parts that give a good aftertaste.
Professional boundaries.
If meticulous calculations and unexpected accidents that are still unreadable were related to someone's life, even if they were calculated from the beginning to some extent, they would probably be prepared to risk themselves.
The script was brilliant in that embodied such a subtle heart-shaking drama, how far she deceived those around her in order to fight her own conflicts that she did not show in public, and how far she deceived those around her in order to pass her beliefs.
And I'll think about it with that Jessica's performance is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no misunderstanding.
It's a professional job.
It felt like it was in use and then broke down.
I have used 3 units so far, but this product broke in no time, in both good and bad ways.
The reason I chose this product was the first 2200 mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 5 minutes and 3 sessions at 200 degrees.
The second USB port is defective.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I reinserted the battery about 15 times ( I used the battery in the charger so that the USB terminal would not break), it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press down on the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an ICOS user, I think some people have experience.
It's that symptom.
As noted in the notes, batteries other than those attached are not used.
The claws and catch seem to be machined, so there seems to be no bending or anything, such as bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought the one without the Starley logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the content compared to this one.
It looks the same size and looks the same.
The chamber and draw are the same.
LCD This one is more beautiful.
Maybe newer than without the logo.
This vibe is modest.
It looks like a smartphone vibrator.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator is loud or the sound is loud.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese, but...
Attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without the logo, it is solid like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks down soon, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I had no choice but to return it, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
It's just ear rubber, but it's ear rubber.
This flat rubber really does not hurt.
In terms of ear comfort, it is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far.
Even flat rubber can get twisted, and the twisted hem rubs against the base of the ear, which can be more painful than round rubber, but I think this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just less likely to twist out.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only does it fit well, but there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel stuffy, so it is difficult to feel stuffy.
It may be because it fits the size of your face, which is probably because it fits your face.
I don't know if it will suit everyone in the same way, but if you don't like the other smaller sizes, I think you should try it once.
When you open the outer box, it is in a vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when you take out the first one, the ear rubbers on both sides get caught and it is difficult to take out, so I deducted one star for that amount.
The vendor's response is 1 star.
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the response of the merchant who ignored me despite specifying the date.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy from Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible because they would carry especially heavy items upstairs, but it was ruined.
It is said that shipping companies are having a hard time because of Amazon, but I am doing it in the hope that there is one thing that users can cooperate with.
I am disappointed in the response of the arrogant vendor.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering buying it, it includes disposal costs, including disposal costs.
I think there is a lot of dissatisfaction and it can not be used for a long time.
I think it is a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal when disposing of it, including the cost of disposal.
For reference, some municipalities seem to have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or cheap if you bring it in.
[Comfortable] The seat tilts slightly to the left and wobbles even more, so sitting is very tiring and very tiring.
Even the slightest movement makes a loud creaking noise.
It is noisy and cannot be used at night.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel that I cannot continue to use it with this.
[Assembly] Assembly instructions only explain with rough pictures.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
・ Some people have written that they lean forward in a review that does not explain the orientation when installing the seat and the post fixing platform, but the orientation when installing the seat and the post fixing platform may be the opposite.
When installed correctly, the lever for adjusting the height is facing backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is facing forward.
However, many people will install the height adjustment lever incorrectly because it is more natural to be positive.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and you have to assemble it while trying and making errors while looking at miscellaneous pictures.
・There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who cannot find the 8x20mm screws that come with the 12 screws and look for them.
The 8x20mm screws are already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for them in vain.
The machining accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted even with the same screw holes and screws, and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws inserted in this way.
Also, I couldn't find the spare screw in the manual and couldn't find it.
[Other] The black part of the vinyl leather surface is unevenly colored, and it is whitish in some places, so you should not expect something beautiful like the product photo.
An explanation of the incompleteness of the instruction manual and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were sent to an email address registered with Amazon 2-3 days after the arrival of the product.
Originally, these items should be sent out immediately after the product is shipped.
This is a completely meaningless act because many buyers have already completed assembly within 2 to 3 days of receiving the product, so it is a completely meaningless act because many buyers have already completed assembly.
Hm, there we go
I am a big fan of thermos and have been using straw type thermos for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use among all the models I have used so far
( 1) The mouthpiece part of the straw has become a harder material than before, so that the groove fits into the main body so that the mouthpiece part of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body at all.
i I desperately tried to take it and broke my nails
( 2) Only the tip of the drinking spout part of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer enter.
3 The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically difficult to wash.
I haven't had any complaints about using the straw type so far, so I'm a bit shocked because I haven't used it yet, so it's a bit of a shock.
It is really stressful that the mouthpiece cannot be removed from the main body.
The good thing is that it still has excellent cooling power.
I forgot to take it out of my bag and when I washed it the next day, I still had about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink Hot, so I will continue to be a straw type person.
Please improve it in the next model.
First review ( with additional photos) .
I am reviewing for the first time.
( I'm an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time) I received the product as pictured in the picture.
When I put it on my Obitsu doll, it is very cute and I am very satisfied with the light.
However, it cannot be installed unless you push it a little hard at the time of wearing ( entrance) and press it with force.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
It was my first time shipping from overseas, so I was expecting it to arrive in three weeks, but it arrived earlier than I expected, in 8 days ( Narita Airport is close) .
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent, so I was worried.
When I looked at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it said that it was still shipping.
There was no damage and air in my eyes, and there was a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's safe to say that it was in a small sealed bag with a lot of bubble wrap.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, it was a mail mail from abroad, but personal information is okay.
I felt a doubt, so I will make it minus 1 to give it a minus 1, because I have felt a doubt.
The product is fine, and at that price, I think it is a great deal with this amount.
Postscript doll eye 8mm model iPhonese.
A little small ( small work area), badly charged
I looked at the size notation and ordered it, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than A4 size, but since the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4 size.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices and making gunpla, but it's hard to use without B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work, and use a different tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to use a different tray or mat.
Within a magazine-sized area, tools are placed, parts are placed, and more work is done i i It's impossible to do that.
I thought about ordering another one of the same thing to double the area, but the work is too charged and all dust and cut parts are sucked in, so I think it's difficult to keep using it for a while.
A fatal flaw.
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened it using a rubber non-slip sheet, but when I loaded the battery and closed it, it would not close even if I tried to load it.
It's out at this point.
Highly rated people.
Will the battery box lid close? i i
In addition, instead of a protective seal on the product, there was a small, fluffy salad wrap that was attached to it.
This might be a used item i
The only explanation is in English, which is written densely on a small piece of paper.
There are no illustrated explanations and I don't know how to operate at all.
It might be better for other fingers...
I found a good product.
I immediately bought it because I thought it was the best.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't fit properly and it gets a little stiff...t was...t was.
But I think it's good for use on other fingers.
But I think I'm a good idea merchant.
Good for the price.
After all, you shouldn't want quality from this kind of product.
One flower mark was crushed.
The size is just right when I put it on.
Although people with thick ear lobes may be harsh.
Maybe I should have bought something without a pattern.
It's delicious.
The design is good, but if you put it on your hand, the effect will not fade even if you put it on a large foot.
In the bitter winter season in the east of Hokkaido...
As in other reviews, the heating wire is only 110 x 80 net, and the placement is horizontal instead of vertical, but not horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm up the entire futon, but it was more expensive than the mattress type, but it was bigger, but I can't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer, so I guess I can't help it because I can't check it like a famous manufacturer.
I have to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N-warm of 0トリ.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's well done, but it's well done.
It is small and has sufficient air volume.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare ones.
If you put it on your desk and adjust the angle, it's better to do it like in the picture.
If it is a smooth desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you lay down a handkerchief, there is no problem with it.
If you use it outside / at a family restaurant, you won't notice it even if it's "medium", but if it's an office, it's not noisy even if it's "small", it's not noisy even if it's "small" or something.
It is necessary to divide it as an attendant when you go out.
In addition, even if it is "small" in office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It's perfect for scenes where you're sweating profusely on the road and you're fleeing to a family restaurant and you're "big" and cooling down at once.
The only thing is that when I throw it in my bag, the power button is rarely pressed and left spinning without my knowledge.
It would be nice to have an idea such as slightly retracting ( depressing) the button, or holding down the weak first press.
It is an essential item in times of extreme heat that are life-threatening, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multifunctional light speaker.
I use the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
It is better than I thought.
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminosity and color with touch.
The white color fits in any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful because it changes in gradation.
Also, if you touch your favorite color with one touch, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood.
Since it is an LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think it is more than satisfactory enough for my amateur ears.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional anyway, which is multifunctional on this light.
・There is a large speaker on the top.
You can enjoy music wirelessly with Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones, etc.
・ By pairing with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・In addition, since it supports MicroSD, it can be used in conjunction with a computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
typing and piano practice.
At the age of 66, he started taking on DTMs to prevent blurring.
I purchased an audio interface and this instrument.
At first I was typing, but I became addicted to playing the piano and practiced every day.
I downloaded the sound source that came with it, but the protection didn't work well, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel deceived by the appearance.
Is it a product that is out of line or out of line?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the Doushisha office chair ( flip-up armrest) that I used for 4-5 years deteriorated and became tattered, so I'm considering purchasing a non-synthetic leather chair with a flip-up armrest.
I searched home improvement stores and furniture stores, but there are no suitable items.
I'm worried that I can't check the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact, but it is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[Caution] The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't know if the hexagonal wrench had oil on it and the main body was white, so I was in a hurry when the oil got on it.
Assembly is completed in 40 minutes.
Confirm the completed product.
The flip-up armrest has different hardness when raising and lowering on the left and right, the left is heavy and the right is light when raising and lowering, and the armrest is not easy to use ( there is no adjustment method) .
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and hangs down immediately with a "click" sound.
The seat feels hard with non-recycled high-density urethane foam and is not comfortable to sit on ( weak elasticity) .
) The competition mesh on the backrest is harder than other mesh chairs, and it hurts the back when worn thinly.
In detail, the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 ( the height of the seat height is important for tall people), and the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so there are questions about durability.
I lay down a cushion that I bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is likely to deteriorate ( damage) quickly, so I use it with a towel.
At 186cm 80kg, I felt that only the fit of the back was good, but other than that, I think that the satisfaction of the product is low, and I feel that it is a hit-or-miss product.
After all, it may be better to sit down and buy an office chair after seeing the actual product.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying hello, so I would like to inquire about the armrests and headrests?
Under consideration i
Well, what is this?
In my environment, it seems that BS4K turning right can be seen, so I bought a Pixela 4K tuner, which was cheap, without expecting much, and the price was low.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free right-handed broadcasts such as NHKBS4K, and I was able to watch it beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV that I purchased at the same time.
( Sometimes the image is crunchy) The update came soon after purchase, and it became recording compatible, so I made a few reservation recordings and watched it, but it was 2 outer keys. wonder if there is also an impact of 5 inch HDD, because only the image stops and frames are skipped during playback.
The user interface has never been praised, and it is clear that "4K broadcasts can be seen", but 4K broadcasts can be seen".
By the way, during scheduled recording, I feel that I can only track and play back the recorded program, and this is also accepted as a plus function that I can record in 4K on HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy with various expectations, so do not expect too much.
I hope the update will improve it.
Keep warm function is OK.
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it warmed up in about 2 hours and became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan noise is noticeable when idling is stopped, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the chemical smell emitted by the fan because it was still new, so I had to open the window regularly to ventilate it.
As another person wrote in the review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder string passes are terrible, so you need to fold the burrs with flathead screws, etc.
Really fragile, really fragile.
Today, after 2 months of use, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel and size of the keys, but it doesn't make sense if it's broken.
I use a PC all day to process video, but the volume will become 100% on its own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use earphones because my ears hurt, but the volume is uncomfortable to use a PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard every time.
The enter key and backspace key no longer responded.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it costs 1, 000 yen, you may want to try it.
If you are lucky, you can use it for half a year.
This 6-month warranty is compared to other companies' 1- to 3-year warranty in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks volumes of its fragility.
The product is the best, and the packaging is the worst.
I love the product in different colors and I love it.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a food stocker
However, there was a gap in the large cardboard that rolled and rolled, there was no delivery note, and the packaging was the worst.
The lid was also off when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for the time being.
When I bought a new lid, I bought it because the support was not hearty enough, so I bought it because I couldn't help but feel unsupported.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make an unpleasant sound.
I have to choose one that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when buying it.
Cute backs with cute meatballs.
I had a dog and was looking for a backpack to go out with, so I was attracted to the stylish gray backpack and bought this one.
It was assembled and surprisingly light when I held it, so it didn't feel that heavy even when I held it.
The zipper works smoothly and there is no kind of snagging.
It seems easy to travel for a long time.
It's very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, the design of the meatball can be seen, and it is cute even when placed.
Lightweight and comfortable to use.
The pulley is also comfortable to use round and round.
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with the appearance and the low price. have just bought this one.
TSA lock is my favorite for a few years and I have a few others, but it's convenient, right?
And as a master of forgetting or losing keys, number locks are recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's good, but if you want durability and security, the zipper is a week, and since it's a cloth, it's a knife and a pinch.f it is cut, it will break in an instant.
Also, the fasteners are sweet to match, so I would like to see a way to overlap them because they are sweet to match.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to carry it on board.
For now, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable and comfortable.
Difficult to choose size...
Because of the width, it is difficult to buy shoes, but because of the width, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and Buns wear 24cm.
MRL996も24cm。 i
so first off bard top what a pick ikr. thought, but once I got used to it, I was fine.
In this ML574, my sister is 24th. When I said that 5cm was tough, I had to wear it, it was definitely tough.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
That's why I bought 25cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was big...
When I tried to wear it, even if I wore socks, they were a little loose.
I was wondering if I'd give it back, but 24 would be fine.f you get tough with 5 things, it will be troublesome, so I think I will wear it with an insole at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red, but it's bright red and it's very good.
There are a lot of black and white monotone clothes, so wearing this will make it brighter if you wear this.
165 cm, male in his 40s, male in his 40s.
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if you have similar specifications below, I recommend the M size.
He’ s old. 165cm Weight 60 kg Waist. 81 cm deep umbrella around you.t is a typical 100 cm metabolic belly.
<Comfortable use> Underwater, the rash guard rolls up, probably because the waist is loose.
I am swimming while fixing the part that is turned up while fixing it.
Especially when you are alert in the jacuzzi, your metabolic belly is in full view.
Also, if you walk while exercising vigorously up and down, it will still roll up from the bottom.
<Making of the product> The fabric is strong and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this product, but I think it will fit better if you buy a smaller size.
After all, there was a gas leak, but...
Silver Colt 25 was still leaking gas, and when I was replacing the valve, there was a problem that part of the tank was missing, but I used [Bus Bond Q] to seal the tank and grease it up. was able to hit it well.f you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble it and assemble it while taking digital photos, so I don't recommend it to those who are not confident, but if you think it's okay to break, you may be able to buy another black Colt 25, the trick to disassemble it is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, and I managed to disassemble it without flying parts. When assembling, I applied silicone grease to the spring or fine parts while fixing it with grease. When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the sc i
I was wondering what kind of quality 188 yen was.
It can be used separately when fast turning and when torque is required.
It's light and small, and above all, I like the simplicity of it without any fancy decorations.
There is no rattling when the bits are attached, and I thought that 188 yen would be an amazing cost performance.
What about durability is this?
It may not be used that often, but I think it's a good thing to put it in the toolbox.
I bought it together with the same seller's "1/4" hexagonal shampoo magnetic quick release screwdriver knurled bit holder 60/100/150mm" from the same vendor.
There was no problem here either, or it was pretty good for the price.
The controller stops working.
The unit moves on its own and becomes inoperable without being able to operate.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine moves in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I would like to warn you all about this.
This is a terrible product.
It is wired, but we recommend the BEBONCOOLPS3 controller.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even after a long use.
It can also be used for PC games.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
This will improve computing power.
I think it is suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible if you are a child who understands calculations to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give tools to my master, I slide my finger up on the screen, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I do it, it doesn't go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easy for people who are used to DS to slide
I don't like the illustrations of the characters in the manga either, so I think DSs and the like are entered because of the fun of the screen, but for some reason I can't get familiar with them... can't get familiar with them for some reason...
The method of calculation is also a way to compete for time, for example, how many questions are answered correctly in how many minutes.
I understand how you feel about being rushed for an exam, but... Wouldn't you like to rush and calculate?
I don't like the gong ringing when it's over, for some reason I don't like it.
Isn't it okay to make it sound more pleasant even though you're working hard?
I feel like I lost some money with this 6, 200 yen.
I understand if it's half the price, but it's half the price.
I'm sorry, this is why I gave it 2 Stars.
After all, Persona's songs are good.
As for Persona 3, I reached the ED.
5 played halfway through.
Persona 4 has been troconned with vita.
What you can do hasn't changed from the previous Persona 4.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous one.
The song is cool after all, but that’ s really cool.
Just listening to it makes me feel better.
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I first saw them.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome ( laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... With that in mind, I feel that 3 is a better deal.
As a sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3 to play.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at music games can play it.
Sound game masters may turn on the challenge function to make it a crunchy game.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
It’ s kind of a shame, I don’ t know.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product is blue, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but at the moment the pending price is low, so I wonder if I can give up because the price is cheap.
After posting the supplementary review, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging it for a new product.
Subsequent processing was also quick.
I think that the response was very good despite the inexpensive product.
Added 4 stars to support, then purchased gold and bought gold.
The color is almost as pictured and I think it is very beautiful.
But after all, the buckle is not double-locked, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
That's the only pity.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used it on my sim free iPhone 7s and it used on my sim free iPhone 7s.
In the first setup, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me ( turn on data roaming from Settings>Mobile Communications>Communications Options) and it worked well.
The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...
However, around Gimpo Airport, I was grabbing 3G for a long time, whether the radio signal was bad or not.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evenings and at night, the communication sometimes became very slow, but now that I think about it, I think I may have reached the maximum limit of hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought.
I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, went sim-free and used it on Ymobile, and when I was looking for a second-hand Xperia because Z4 was getting bad, I found this phone that is new and can use my Osaifu phone and bought it.
I was worried about whether I could use it properly because I was using mobile Suica, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like the iPhone 6 at first glance. That's my impression.
I don't play games, so the processing speed is the same as Z4, but I have the impression that it's a little faster.n the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes a little time to recognize, so face recognition is faster, so I use it here. use it here.
I thought it was amazing because it was like an iPhone.
What I was worried about is that there is no strap hole that is a little smaller * I have not experimented with the corresponding water resistance of a case with a strap hole. have used it a little bit yet, but I am satisfied recommend it.
